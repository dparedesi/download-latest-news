Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Years ago, these index reconstitutions had very little impact on trading. Not anymore. The explosion of index-based ETFs has changed all that. Today, roughly $16 trillion is indexed to the S&P 500. The largest Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ), has $321 billion in assets, and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Index mutual fund (IVNQX) has about $100 billion in assets, so we are talking well north of $400 billion in additional assets pegged to the Nasdaq-100. Bottom line: what stocks are added to or deleted from these large indexes matters a lot. If you doubt that being included in a large index matters, just ask Palantir Technologies. It apparently believes it is very important. On November 14, the company issued a three-sentence (!) press release announcing that it was transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market. Palantir concluded with this: "Upon transferring, Palantir anticipates meeting the eligibility requirements of the Nasdaq-100 Index." Can't make it any plainer than that. And Palantir got its wish. It's being added to the Nasdaq-100 at the close of trading on Friday. Two companies are being added to the S&P 500: Apollo Global Management and Workday. Qorvo and Amentum are being removed. Most people think the S&P 500 is the 500 largest companies in the United States, but it's more complicated than that. There are a number of requirements that have to be met to get into the S&P 500, including a minimum market capitalization of $18 billion. However, there is no obligation to mechanically include only the 500 largest companies by market capitalization: "Constituent selection is at the discretion of the Index Committee and is based on the eligibility criteria," S&P Global's methodology paper says. For S&P, adding Apollo (financials) and Workday (technology) are relatively safe choices. At $96 billion and $70 billion in market cap, both are squarely in the large-cap segment of the market. Still, many investors were hoping that Coinbase Global, which has a similar market cap to Workday ($68 billion) would be added to the S&P 500. It certainly qualifies based on market capitalization and profitability (it's been profitable the last four quarters). But Coinbase is a far more volatile stock than either Apollo or Workday. Coinbase did not make the cut. It's not clear why, but perhaps because the S&P Index Committee was concerned about the volatility. Coinbase is one of the most volatile of all stocks. This year alone, it has moved from a low of $117 to about $350, a 200% move. Perhaps it's a coincidence, but Coinbase was down 9% the day after the S&P inclusion announcement was made, and the cryptocurrency platform was excluded. Sometimes just determining where a stock should be classified can be a big issue, especially when big money is involved. Going into the Nasdaq-100 are MicroStrategy, Palantir and Axon Enterprise. Going out are Illumina, Super Micro Computer and Moderna. To enter the Nasdaq-100, a company has to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market, have a free float of at least 10% and, while there is no minimum or maximum market capitalization requirement, the annual reconstitution (determining who goes in and out), is loosely based on market capitalization: "The Nasdaq-100 Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies," Nasdaq says in its Index Methodology paper. Note the requirement that any entrant be a "non-financial stock." Based on market capitalization, MicroStrategy has certainly earned its spot in the Nasdaq-100. It has been a monster this year, up over 400%, and now sports a market cap of about $80 billion. That alone would put MicroStrategy in the top half of the Nasdaq-100 by market value. Like Coinbase, it is a very volatile stock (trading range in 2024: $50 to $500). More interesting is the fact that MicroStrategy is listed as a technology stock, but given that about half its value is in bitcoin (it owns 439,000 bitcoin with a current value about $42 billion), is it accurate to call it a tech stock? Chairman Michael Saylor has said he wants to run MicroStrategy as a "bitcoin bank." Should we take him at his word? Should MicroStrategy be classified as a financial stock, which would make it ineligible to be in the Nasdaq-100? For the moment, it's classified as a technology stock. Whether it stays there is uncertain. There's this thing called the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), which is the system developed to categorize public companies into specific industries and sectors. There are periodic reviews to make sure companies are in their appropriate sectors. But that is for another day. For the moment, Bitcoin fans are loving it. Their darling is in the Nasdaq-100. Whether index fans will love it is yet to be determined. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Michael Saylor says he’d be willing to advise Trump on crypto matters

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor said Wednesday that he would be willing to provide advisory support to President-elect Donald Trump on crypto matters if asked. “I’m always willing to provide a thought on constructive digital asset policy either in confidence or publicly. And if I’m asked to serve on some sort of Digital Assets Advisory Council. I probably would,” said Saylor, speaking on Bloomberg Open Interest. While Saylor confirmed meeting with many people in the incoming Trump administration, he declined to provide further details. The statement comes as MicroStrategy prepares to join the Nasdaq-100 alongside Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise, replacing Super Micro Computer, Moderna, and Illumina, effective December 23. However, the company’s Bitcoin holdings could jeopardize its index position. MicroStrategy recently acquired an additional $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at approximately $45 billion. The massive Bitcoin stash might lead to MicroStrategy’s reclassification as a financial company in a March review by the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). This reclassification would likely result in the company’s removal from the Nasdaq-100, as the index exclusively comprises non-financial firms. Addressing concerns surrounding MicroStrategy’s reclassification, Saylor asserted that the company is not solely reliant on its Bitcoin investments. The software division generates significant operating income, which he quantifies at about $75 million per year. “We have a very healthy software division now and we’re very proud of it,” Saylor stated. He noted that he had no plans to spin off MicroStrategy. “It’s profitable and it’s a core part of the company’s identity.” “We also think of ourselves primarily as a Bitcoin Treasury company now. So our primary method of generating shareholder value is through our Treasury operations,” Saylor noted. “There are three ways to create value for shareholders; there’s operating income and our software business generates about $75 million a year of operating income. There’s also investment income that’s been difficult to track. But right now we have $18.6 billion of unrealized investment income,” he added. Saylor noted that MicroStrategy “is engaged” in strategic acquisitions similar to practices seen in other tech companies like Apple. MicroStrategy has acquired around $17 billion worth of Bitcoin since announcing its 21/21 plan to fund its future Bitcoin purchases. With this pace of accumulation, the company could reach its $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition target by January 2025. When asked about potential adjustments to the plan, Saylor indicated that MicroStrategy would re-evaluate its capital allocation strategy once the $42 billion target is met. “When we get through the 21/21 plan, which has $42 billion in capital, we’ll revisit our capital plan and we’ll put in place a new plan subject to market conditions at the time,” he said. Saylor said that the company expects to lean more heavily towards raising capital through fixed-income markets in the coming quarter to increase leverage, which would enhance returns for its common stock shareholders. While fixed income is the primary focus, they will also consider other options like preferred stock, convertible bonds, or equity-linked financings, depending on market conditions, according to Saylor. MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin investment led to its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, but its entry into the S&P 500 seems unlikely due to failing the index’s profitability requirements. The company has been profitable in only one of the past four quarters, a key criterion for S&P 500 inclusion, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared in a statement. Despite this, upcoming changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may improve MicroStrategy’s financial reporting, according to the analyst. Discussing MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the S&P 500, Saylor noted that the decision-making process and specific criteria are beyond his expertise. However, he expressed optimism about future prospects. “I’m optimistic that in 2025, when we adopt fair value accounting, we end up with $50 billion of assets on our balance sheet, under fair value of Bitcoin goes up 20% a year, you’re looking at $10 billion a year of investment income,” Saylor said. “I expect we’ll be generating billions of dollars a year or tens of billions of dollars a year of investment income, which becomes GAAP profitability,” he added. “I think that is the final thing people are looking for in inclusion in the S&P.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother’s autopsy report. There it was, one devastating word: “accident.” The papers trembled in her hands. Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold’s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff’s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn’t breathing. How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide. Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner’s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight. “No more silence or complacency,” she thought. “No sweeping it under the rug.” In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died — what’s known as the manner and cause of death. On TV dramas such as “CSI” or “Bones,” facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren’t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police. Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP’s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use — even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted “excited delirium,” a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill. Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon. The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement. The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement. “I call it a crazy quilt,” said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners’ independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family’s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher. “I had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you’d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime — police officer or not,” Jen Dold said. “Sadly, we realized this was not the case.” Jen Dold — 11 years older than Alex — had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially. One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left. The county mental health department wouldn’t send someone, saying Dold wasn’t violent enough. When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment. Two Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door. Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold’s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied. Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report. Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill. “It was the worst yelling, shouting I’ve ever heard,” one neighbor told an investigator. After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes. Jen Dold didn’t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother’s mental illness, she thought to protect officers. Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County’s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he’d weigh police force. Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn’t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident. Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold’s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied — Selove used it even though under his own office’s policies intent “need not be present or proven” for a homicide ruling. For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn’t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it — and doing so has “some value” to reduce any appearance of a cover-up. Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization’s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court. The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force. Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother’s death accountable was a lawsuit. Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother’s death, Deputy McGee — the first one into Dold’s home — had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty. The county had settled that family’s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help. As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold’s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it. Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County. Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold’s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident. “I have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,” Adams said. “Why do you say it’s a homicide?” the lawyer asked. “Because when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn’t matter about the intent,” Adams replied. The family hugged. “We just kept saying, ‘Did he really just say that? Did he really just say ‘homicide'?” Jen Dold recalled. Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn’t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove’s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a “danger to public health and safety.” In an interview, Selove said Adams’ homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn’t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him. The county offered Dold’s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn’t budge. She finally relented. “The process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,” she said. When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold’s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records. In the seven years since her brother’s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe. A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner’s report was different by just one word — homicide? While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials — the police chief or sheriff, the mayor — as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers. In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger. Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting. Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, “I think they George Floyded him.” The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state’s chief medical examiner. Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers. “Great day!!” Brave wrote in one. “After our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.” He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as “superhuman strength” and high pain tolerance. Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what’s known as prone position — the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP’s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor. Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson’s death was due to methamphetamine-induced “psychomotor agitation” and “physical exertion with physical restraint.” The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined — one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide. Miller didn’t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn’t trying to influence her — he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages. Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy. In a 2018 “Managing Your Medical Examiner” web presentation, a longtime member of the company’s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. “Control the narrative” by getting the deceased’s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are “hostile,” line up police-friendly experts to counter them. Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not “infallible truth” but rather “driven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.” Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die “walking time bombs.” Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths. One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause. “Dangerously close to intimidation,” the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time. Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association’s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they “suffered consequences,” including being fired. In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be “independent from law enforcement and prosecutors,” and based on scientific evidence and research. Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes. Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show. After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state’s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith’s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification “wrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts … to baselessly vilify police officers.” The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he “was not pressuring anyone” but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages. In March 2019, an officer’s punch fractured a 54-year-old man’s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington’s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor. The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn’s death was tragic but the medical examiner’s report had “confusing and contradictory findings.” Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont. An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement. State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas’ justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties. In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner’s office. The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be. The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field. Briones survived the wreck — but not the night. Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn’t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment. By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late. Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently. The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths — typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system. Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner’s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner’s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide. In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that — at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches — Briones was “morbidly obese.” He ruled the death natural. The Briones family couldn’t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn’t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment. San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP’s database and ruled none a homicide. In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP’s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later — in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake’s death a homicide attributable to tasing. All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County’s four deaths was. Miami’s chief medical examiner declined to comment. The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner’s office in Snohomish County, Washington.

Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother’s autopsy report. There it was, one devastating word: “accident.” The papers trembled in her hands. Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold’s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff’s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn’t breathing. How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide. Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner’s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight. “No more silence or complacency,” she thought. “No sweeping it under the rug.” In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died — what’s known as the manner and cause of death. On TV dramas such as “CSI” or “Bones,” facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren’t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police. Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP’s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use — even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted “excited delirium,” a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill. Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon. The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement. The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement. “I call it a crazy quilt,” said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners’ independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family’s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher. “I had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you’d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime — police officer or not,” Jen Dold said. “Sadly, we realized this was not the case.” Jen Dold — 11 years older than Alex — had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially. One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left. The county mental health department wouldn’t send someone, saying Dold wasn’t violent enough. When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment. Two Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door. Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold’s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied. Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report. Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill. “It was the worst yelling, shouting I’ve ever heard,” one neighbor told an investigator. After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes. Jen Dold didn’t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother’s mental illness, she thought to protect officers. Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County’s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he’d weigh police force. Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn’t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident. Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold’s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied — Selove used it even though under his own office’s policies intent “need not be present or proven” for a homicide ruling. For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn’t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it — and doing so has “some value” to reduce any appearance of a cover-up. Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization’s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court. The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force. Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother’s death accountable was a lawsuit. Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother’s death, Deputy McGee — the first one into Dold’s home — had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty. The county had settled that family’s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help. As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold’s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it. Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County. Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold’s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident. “I have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,” Adams said. “Why do you say it’s a homicide?” the lawyer asked. “Because when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn’t matter about the intent,” Adams replied. The family hugged. “We just kept saying, ‘Did he really just say that? Did he really just say ‘homicide'?” Jen Dold recalled. Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn’t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove’s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a “danger to public health and safety.” In an interview, Selove said Adams’ homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn’t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him. The county offered Dold’s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn’t budge. She finally relented. “The process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,” she said. When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold’s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records. In the seven years since her brother’s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe. A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner’s report was different by just one word — homicide? While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not.
