On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD. As of 12/8/2024, we hodl 423,650 $BTC acquired for ~$25.6 billion at ~$60,324 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/8r7bFqMFof This means that approximately 46.9% of MicroStrategy’s market capitalization is directly attributable to its Bitcoin holdings at the current price. This leaves about 53.1% of the market cap representing the company’s core business, other assets, and a premium for its Bitcoin strategy.

Title: Nasdaq announces MicroStrategy’s inclusion in Nasdaq-100, what’s next?

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Play Raises Questions About Nasdaq 100 Inclusion

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc. checks all the boxes for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a development that would trigger purchases of the shares by the $451 billion worth of exchange-traded funds around the world that directly track the benchmark. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters American Institute of Architects CEO Resigns Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Dream San Francisco, Paris Named Best Cities for Urban Transportation City Hall Is Hiring Yet market watchers are entertaining the possibility it gets snubbed in the index’s annual reshuffling on Friday for one simple reason: MicroStrategy has morphed into a levered bet on Bitcoin attached to a small software company that many say has no business being among the 100 most-important stocks on the Nasdaq. “The idea of an index is it’s supposed to really represent faithfully the body of stocks that are in the universe,” said TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, who has a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy. “Any large company that makes up a material portion of the Nasdaq universe should be reflected as being in the index.” Shares of the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm co-founded by Saylor have mesmerized Wall Street this year by surging more than 500% as the company accelerates an unconventional plan to raise capital solely to purchase and hold more Bitcoin. It has announced multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the cryptocurrency every Monday over the past five weeks. With the token’s price reaching all-time highs recently, MicroStrategy now holds more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin. But its underlying business had a net loss of $340 million in third quarter of this year. Still, the company’s $98 billion market capitalization, which would make it roughly the 40th biggest stock in the Nasdaq 100, is largely based on its Bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy, and this could factor into whether the stock is added to the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq could use the small size of MicroStrategy’s operating business as a reason not to add the company to the index, Vitanza said. However, that would be counterintuitive since the company’s market capitalization is so large, he added. ‘Bitcoin Treasury Company’ MicroStrategy’s software business offers it a benefit when it comes to inclusion in the Nasdaq benchmark, as financial companies are ineligible for the Nasdaq 100. MicroStrategy has called itself a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” but since its revenue comes from its software business, it is classified as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark, making it fair game for the index. The ICB could choose to reclassify MicroStrategy as a financial stock during the next change in March, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, said that MicroStrategy is now more similar to a commodity or an ETF since it is “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin. He thinks it should be reclassified as a financial-company next year. “One hundred percent of the value of the company is Bitcoin because the rest of the company is potentially a negative,” Lebowitz said in an interview. “A large majority of the company is just purely its Bitcoin holdings and the financial machinations around it, so it is a financial company.” Nonetheless, should it be added to the index, it would “introduce the potential for very large amounts of passive inflows into MicroStrategy shares and could provide a boost to its stock,” said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who also has a “buy” recommendation on the stock. MicroStrategy aims to raise $42 billion in capital from equity and fixed income securities offerings over the next three years, and has already surpassed its 2025 goal for equity. An increase in its stock price from inclusion in the index would help the company issue stock at premium and support its overall strategy of purchasing more Bitcoin, Palmer said. The increase in trading of the shares should the company be added to the index might not make a big difference to its liquidity, but it would bring in new investors, TD’s Vitanza said. “If you think about the liquidity in the stock and the volume of shares that trade, it’s not all that much,” Vitanza said. “But it will be new pockets of capital, so I think that the people that are going to wind up owning the stock on the other end of the index are clearly different people that are buying stock in the at-the-market” price. Joining the broader US benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, would be a different story. The S&P 500 considers the profitability of new additions to its index, which could be a barrier for MicroStrategy, which has posted net losses for three of the past four quarters. “The fact that they are not a traditional operating company in the traditional sense of the way that we describe that, I think, has much more of a bearing on the S&P 500 than it does in the Nasdaq 100,” Vitanza said. The Nasdaq index has long differentiated itself from the S&P 500 by focusing on non-financial companies, and only those listed on Nasdaq. The exchange itself has launched its own digital-asset products, offering a software platform for crypto exchanges to go to market. Palantir Technologies Inc. and Axon Enterprise Inc. could also be added to the Nasdaq 100, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Changes to the index will take effect on Dec. 23.

What makes a company a great place to work for IT professionals? Top salaries and benefits certainly help, but those are just table stakes. Tech workers are looking for challenging projects, growth opportunities, and continuous learning in a supportive workplace. For the 31st year, Computerworld publisher Foundry surveyed large, midsize, and small organizations to find the top IT employers. Read our special report to see which companies made our list and what makes them such desirable places to work. To read the Best Places to Work in IT 2025 report in PDF format, download it below (no registration required). The ongoing quest for technical talent in an uncertain economic environment has caused many organizations to turn their attention inward, taking steps to keep their existing IT workforce engaged and invested in the overall business charter. The goal: build a collaborative IT culture defined by continuous learning, meaningful work, and positive contributions to the business. Companies participating in Computerworld’s 31st annual “Best Places to Work in IT” survey show a strong commitment to in-house IT talent, even as they cast a wider net for IT candidates to build a more diverse workforce that fosters creativity and innovation. A heightened emphasis on training is designed to enrich technical skills — especially in artificial intelligence (AI), analytics, and the cloud — as well as soft skill sets that align with broader business objectives. “We are steadfast in our technology investments and continue to modernize our skill sets, technologies, and processes at the same speed as ever — or even faster,” says Deepa Soni, chief information and operations officer at The Hartford, ranked No. 2 overall and No. 4 in the career development/training category among large companies in this year’s survey. “We think about three things to make IT the best destination for internal and external folks: Leveraging cutting-edge technology and solutions, creating business impact, and building a culture that fosters creativity while being inclusive and diverse.” Our survey found that the relentless pace of new hiring over the past two years remains robust. Among the surveyed companies, 79% have increased the total number of IT employees over the last three years, on average by 36%. This is down from a high of 86% in the 2024 survey but surpasses the 72% of companies reporting three-year IT workforce gains in 2023. But although IT hiring is picking up steam again after a brief lull, survey respondents indicated that another cooling-off period may lie ahead. Just half of this year’s respondents plan to increase the number of IT hires over the next fiscal year, down significantly from the previous two years (71% and 72%, respectively). Nearly half of the organizations (46%) expect the size of their IT workforce to remain the same, with larger firms more likely to face hiring slowdowns. Conversely, 70% of smaller companies plan to add IT talent, with an average increase of 10%. VyStar Credit Union, ranked third overall among midsize company respondents, is being very intentional about its IT hiring strategy while it moves to fill key openings. The plan is to slowly augment its 271-person IT staff with several critical positions, including a high-level AI thought leader and champion, several data architects, and engineers versed in software development life cycle skills such as DevOps automation. “We are focused on how to make the best use of AI for our organization and are on a relentless journey to automate and streamline processes,” says Lisa Cochran, CIO of VyStar. “We are a heavily regulated organization, so we must have consistent ways of documenting changes. If we can capture and create artifacts without a human, then developers can spend less time on documentation.” Like VyStar, many other companies are mapping the smaller number of external hires to highly coveted emerging skills categories — many of which are in short supply in the general marketplace. Among this year’s respondents, most new open IT-related positions fall into critical skills groups such as AI/machine learning (86%), data science/analytics (78%), cloud/multicloud (76%), and IT/cybersecurity (67%). In each of these competency areas, companies have dialed up hiring over last year’s, most significantly in the AI/machine learning (ML) area, which saw a 12-point year-over-year hike. To address the need for more traditional IT skills, companies are relying more heavily on contract workers. In this year’s survey, the number of temporary or contract workers increased 10% on average across all respondents, compared with an average 7% decrease in contract workers hired over the prior 12 months. While casting an eye toward external talent, organizations continue to promote from within to hold onto existing talent. This year’s survey found that 13% of IT employees across all companies advanced to new positions in the last fiscal year, much as in the last two years (15% in the 2024 survey and 14% in 2023). Similarly, salary bumps remain in line with last year’s findings, with 90% of IT employees the beneficiaries of a raise. Salary cuts or wage freezes don’t appear to be on the table — the vast majority (96%) of this year’s respondents said no such plans were in the works, now or in the foreseeable future. This year’s survey indicates that IT professionals have plenty of opportunities to take advantage of internal programs to boost their career. Respondent companies are upleveling training programs with new curriculum that burnishes both technical and business skills, going deeper on high-demand technologies such as AI and cloud engineering while also providing education on soft skills such as change management and communications, to accommodate the increasing influence of digital technologies across the business. As part of the emphasis on internal employee development, companies are putting structures in place to help IT professionals actively chart a career course. New mentorship, apprenticeship, and job rotation programs deliver exposure to emerging technology domains as well as full immersion in the business. Defined learning paths and formalized skills assessments help IT workers be more intentional about identifying and addressing critical skills gaps when mapping out their next career move. These efforts continue to move the needle on internal mobility: Approximately 35% of IT vacancies are now being filled through company insiders, equal to last year’s percentage and down slightly from the 38% reported in the 2023 survey. At Amerisure Mutual Insurance, which ranked fourth overall among small companies and sixth for career development and training, communities of practice meet monthly or quarterly, providing cross-functional IT groups and business professionals with demonstrations, tutorials, and training to build expertise in areas such as agile, DevOps, and product architecture. In addition, all IT staffers now participate in a proprietary skills assessment that spells out current skills and targets key areas for improvement. “Development plans can be too broad and not actionable,” notes Amjed Al-Zoubi, Amerisure’s CIO. “This isn’t a checklist but, rather, a very clear conversation and development plan highlighting the skills they need to grow into specific jobs.” Amerisure also bolsters internal IT development practices by increasing the emphasis on business outcomes. Historically, Amerisure assigned people to projects from a central IT talent pool, reassigning them when work was complete. Today, IT teams are aligned with eight different business groups. “There were inefficiencies in our old process, and IT was limited in their ability to learn the business,” Al-Zoubi explains. “Now the IT underwriting team is aligned with the business underwriting team, and they work together to solve underwriting problems. We bring our best, and they bring their best, and it results in higher-performing teams.” Training courses offered by survey respondents run the gamut and are available to all IT employees, regardless of where they work. Technical training, technical certifications, and management training are the most prevalent forms of instruction, but there is also a heavy emphasis on professional career development, building business and soft skills, and even health and wellness. The Hartford is continuing to uplevel its skills development programs to stay abreast of the latest technology trends and leadership skills. For example, the firm has doubled training hours available for cloud, agile development, data science, and cybersecurity. The company’s HartCode Academy Bootcamp provides an avenue for non-IT people to learn software engineering and business data analysis skills, and there are numerous executive-level programs devoted to cultivating leadership skills. “We are helping IT leaders get really comfortable with change and how they lead teams,” Soni says. “We are training folks to be the CIOs of the future.” Given the emphasis on continuous learning, training budgets remain flush, with 39% of this year’s respondents increasing their training budget from the previous year and 59% reporting no change to their allocations. The number of companies increasing their training budget has fallen over the past two years, down from 62% in 2023 and 49% last year. Most companies don’t set caps on training: 77% give employees the latitude to participate in as many programs as they desire. Those that do restrict employees limit them to seven days, on average, of in-person or remote training annually. To spark engagement, companies are courting employees with a variety of tactics, including hosting employee appreciation events (98%), doling out bonuses or other high-value items to reward high performers (92%), and building clear career paths with attainable milestones (88%). Free career development services are also offered by 82% of the respondents. Mentoring programs remain a consistent and widely prevalent vehicle for upskilling existing IT workers, offered by 76% of the responding companies, which is similar to last year. Companies continue to dedicate time and money to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, confident that greater workforce diversity is an important element of company culture as well as a factor in upleveling innovation and diversity of thought. Overall DEI efforts have made an impact, but they’ve been slower to reshape the makeup of the traditional IT workforce, particularly when it comes to women, who made up 27% of the IT workforce among respondents this year, down slightly from 29% in 2024 and 28% in 2023. On the other hand, minority hires are on the rise. Among this year’s respondents, the number of people in IT identifying as part of a minority group jumped to 36%, compared to 33% in the 2024 survey. Minority groups accounted for 29% of the IT managers and 37% of the nonmanagers. The percentage of companies with a formal DEI strategy fell this year to 88%, down six points from 2024. Large firms were more likely to have a formal strategy, at 94%. Companies were also less likely to have a dedicated role in place to promote DEI (54% this year, compared to 62% in 2024), although most respondents (92%) maintain either a person or a team in place to champion DEI policies and awareness. The Hartford has been steadfast in its commitment to diversity, to the point where DEI is infused into company culture instead of serving as a stand-alone program, says Soni. “DEI is baked into the fabric of how we do business quite uniquely,” she says. “We view it as a business necessity — we have to represent the society that we live in in the workplaces we have.” To encourage greater understanding of DEI and its potential impacts, organizations such as The Hartford are serving up a smorgasbord of DEI training, including curriculum focused on preventing discrimination and harassment (96%) and creating an inclusive workspace (92%). Much of the DEI activity is consistent with last year’s survey, with one notable exception: providing targeted internships for women and minorities, at 50% this year, compared to 60% in the 2024 survey. The most popular steps for promoting DEI include celebration of employee differences (96%), recruitment strategies aimed at attracting diverse employees (94%), and diversity and inclusion training (93%). Creating corporate enterprise resource groups (ERGs) based on common goals, interests, and identity affiliations is another way organizations are fostering and empowering like-minded communities. Respondents are forming ERGs to support women, people of color, and LGBTQ populations as well as those aimed at niche areas such as caregivers, veterans, and even video gamers. One of The Hartford’s unique DEI efforts is its reverse mentoring program, where an employee with a diverse background is paired with a senior executive to help that person learn what it’s like to work in the firm as a diverse hire. “It’s about putting our executives in their shoes,” Soni says. The program, which started as an experiment, has been well received by executives as well as mentees, she says. Organizations are shoring up DEI efforts in part through leader accountability. Among the respondents, 33% evaluate IT leaders based on their progress on meeting specific DEI goals, up slightly from last year, 31%. At the same time, DEI progress and outcomes are having an impact on IT leader compensation: 22% this year, compared to 19% in 2024. OCLC, ranked second overall for midsize companies and first in the DEI category, has deployed many of these initiatives and is enjoying success in cultivating a more diverse IT workforce. The company, a nonprofit organization providing technology and services to the library community, has expanded recruiting efforts into diverse talent pools, including technology boot camps aimed at underrepresented communities, while forging partnerships with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Another lever for change: creating new job classes that remove the requirement for a four-year technical degree in tandem with instituting a local outreach coding program. “This produces staff with some level of familiarity with development, but not a degree,” says Bart Murphy, chief technology and information officer of OCLC. “We do a checkpoint every month to ensure the staffer is progressing and getting what they need to move up into an engineering role here or another organization. It’s helped build a diverse pipeline.” The DEI efforts are having an impact. OCLC has shown steady increases in BIPOC and female representation for the last 15 years. Currently the IT department boasts 29.5% female representation, better than the industry average, Murphy says. Well past the height of the pandemic, hybrid work models continue to be the norm, including in IT departments. Much like last year, most respondents (92%) to this year’s survey have established a formal policy on flexible work, although there is no one-size-fits-all model. The breakdown of employee work patterns has remained consistent with last year’s: On average, 13% of IT employees are reporting to the office on a daily basis; 31% are fully remote; and 56% work in some sort of hybrid model, splitting time in and out of the office. Most companies (71%) give employees a moderate level of autonomy to choose where they work, but often the arrangement needs to be approved by the company or meet certain parameters. That’s a notable change from last year, when 62% enjoyed moderate levels of autonomy and 35% could choose where they wanted to work on any given day. Midsize companies are more likely to leave the decision of where to work to employees, at 34%. Companies now have well-established policies to ensure hybrid work success, including provisioning a full slate of technology equipment, formalizing use of collaboration platforms, and training employees and managers on tools and communications best practices. VyStar’s flexible work program lets employees choose the days they work in-office or remotely. Individuals select eight days a month to be in the office, and managers and leaders choose 12 days. All employees can work remotely in July, a perk the company touts as creating better flexibility and work/life balance. “Remote July was created for people who want their kids to visit with grandparents or to see another country,” Cochran says, adding that once a request is made, the IT department provisions the proper secure technology to support the arrangements. “It’s a great benefit, and we get a lot of positive feedback.” Whether they’re recruiting new talent or developing the skills of their in-house teams, the leaders in this year’s “Best Places to Work in IT” study offer a variety of benefits to promote satisfaction and loyalty among the IT workforce. Programs range from comprehensive wellness plans and spot bonuses to financial wellness coaching and even pet insurance. Perhaps the most consequential factor influencing how IT professionals feel about their job is carving out opportunities for meaningful work and continuous professional development. At Tokio Marine North America Services, ranked second overall among small companies and first in both career development/training and DEI, this mindset translates into a culture that emphasizes leading-edge technologies in the context of driving business goals while providing individual advancement opportunities along the way. “Flexible work arrangements and fair compensation make it easier to get people in the door,” says Bob Pick, the company’s executive vice president and CIO. “To keep them here, we train the daylights out of everyone and ensure diagonal and horizontal career mobility. We retain great institutional knowledge, and people get a new career path. It’s a win-win.”— Beth Stackpole See the top workplaces for tech pros at large, midsize, and small organizations. 5,000 or more employees 1,001–4,999 employees 1,000 or fewer employees Computerworld publisher Foundry conducted its 31st annual survey to identify the best places for IT professionals to work. In April 2024, Computerworld started accepting nominations from organizations that had a minimum of 100 total employees and five IT employees. Participants were asked to provide contact information for a person at their organization who is familiar with or has access to employment statistics and financial data as well as benefits policies and programs for the IT department and the entire organization. Beginning in mid-April 2024, contacts at the nominated organizations received a 58-question company survey across six categories: In addition to receiving scores based on answers to closed-ended questions, the survey entries (including numerous open-ended responses) were reviewed and evaluated by a panel of industry experts. The nomination and company surveys were conducted online. Responses to the company survey were collected and tabulated by a third-party research vendor. The research was closed in July 2024. Our top 10 lists show the best of the best — the organizations that excel in each of the six categories covered. To determine each list, we considered the following factors: For scoring the responses from the company surveys, results were weighted against averages and benchmarks calculated within each company size group.
