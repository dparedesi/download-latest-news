Amazon-owned home security company Ring has partnered with Flock Safety, a company whose network of AI-assisted cameras is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies across the US—just weeks after announcing a similar tie-up with security firm Axon Enterprise. The partnerships will allow police to send requests to Ring camera owners when they're trying to track down footage that could help in an ongoing investigation. The requests must include a specific location and timeframe, as well as details about what is being investigated. This Community Requests feature is optional; agencies can’t see who received a notification or who chose not to respond. You can also turn off Community Request notifications altogether. Amazon previously offered a similar program called Request for Assistance (RFA), which it phased out last year. Though 2,000 police departments across the country were thought to have used the feature, it was dogged by accusations of overreach and misuse among neighbors. Last month, Ring revived the program under the Community Requests moniker. "We believe that when neighbors have simple, secure ways to look out for each other, we all benefit," it said. However, the Flock partnership comes after 404 Media revealed that a division of ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has access to Flock’s nationwide network of AI-enabled cameras. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his office investigated reports of abuse by agencies using Flock technology, and "it is my view that Flock has built a dangerous platform in which abuse of surveillance data is almost certain," he wrote in a letter to Flock's CEO this week. "In particular, the company has adopted a see-no-evil approach of not proactively auditing the searches done by its law enforcement customers because, as the company’s Chief Communications Officer told the press, 'it is not Flock’s job to police the police.'"

Title: Axon Enterprise Stock Dropped 13% – Have You Assessed The Risk

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock has decreased by 13.3% over the course of 21 trading days. Do you already own this stock, or are you considering purchasing it? You may want to rethink your decision based on the valuation, as the stock appears expensive. Take a look at the following data: While we typically prefer to buy on dips if the fundamentals are sound – for AXON, see Buy or Sell AXON Stock – we also remain cautious about falling knives. Specifically, it's important to evaluate whether we can hold on to the stock if conditions worsen and AXON declines another 20-30% to around $457. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It turns out that the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We measure this by considering (a) how much the stock declined and (b) how quickly it rebounded. AXON stock has suffered a significant decline recently, and we currently view it as relatively pricey. While this might seem like a buying opportunity, there are substantial risks associated with relying on one stock. Conversely, there is great value in the more diversified approach we advocate with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager situated in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here are the details, but first, for some context: AXON provides conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence globally. Concerned that AXON may drop further? You might explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed its benchmark, encompassing all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother ride, as is clear from the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Microsoft extends its Dragon Copilot AI clinical assistant to nurses and adds an ecosystem for third-party extensions. The nurse capabilities include ambient documentation, access to trusted medical content, and automating routine tasks. From Boysenberry: “Re: self-proclaimed industry experts. You proposed a scoring framework years ago that took into account clinical and IT experience from someone’s LinkedIn profile. Where is that?” I remember it, but I can’t find it despite many searches via Google and ChatGPT. I do recall that some of the folks who were dispensing unsolicited health tech advice scored low, having little actual experience other than in pontification. UPDATE: found it from 2017! See scoring grid above. I didn’t do much with it, and the low-scoring folks are still out there pontificating, so the effect was minimal. In fact, the vastly lowered barrier to entry for podcasts has probably given a whole new batch of industry lightweights a place to hear themselves talk. From New Threads: “Re: corporate rebranding. Why do companies think anyone cares about why they chose a particular logo or website design?” I assume these “our redesigned website shows how we’ve evolved” posts exist mostly so the marketing folks who justified the project can get their ceremonial pat on the head. There’s always a tortured back story that someone has wasted time inventing about how the lowercase typeface represents empathy and the color gradient evokes innovation, when in reality, nobody outside the company cares. Announcing it just makes everyone else uncomfortable, like bragging about how great you look in your new suit while everyone’s politely trying not to roll their eyes because they are perfectly capable of forming an opinion without an announcement or editorializing. They also know that appearances aside, it’s still the same person underneath.

Senior platform vendor Cairns Health acquires Together by Renee, which offers a personal healthcare assistant. Remote care company Brook.ai raises $28 million in Series B funding. Harmony Healthcare IT hires Sharon Cook (Inovalon) as chief revenue officer. Redox and Kno2 partner to offer unified integration, data translation, and nationwide TEFCA connectivity. Mount Sinai researchers develop InfEHR, which scours a patient’s EHR lab results, medications, and vital signs over time to create a personalized network that discovers hidden associations with disease state. Altera Digital Health announces GA of Sunrise Axon, which was built in partnership with Health Gorilla to bring real-time clinical data into Sunrise EHR. Wolters Kluwer Health releases UpToDate Connect, which offers developers API access to its evidence-based clinical content. Surescripts introduces First-Fill Abandonment, which alerts care managers when patients fail to have a first-time prescription filled. Lapsi Health launches Keikku 2.0, a $375 FDA-cleared digital stethoscope that uses AI to generate clinical notes that are integrated into the EHR. Digital health marketplace operator Avia acquires Panda Health, which offers digital health peer input and market intelligence services. HHS’s new Medicare Plan Finder provider directory, which was built by a vendor under the administration’s “Make Health Tech Great Again” program, is generating conflicting or inaccurate listings about whether providers are in-network for Medicare Advantage plans. The tool also limits searches to providers within 50 miles and excludes hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Errors in the temporary open enrollment site, which was intended as a first step toward a national provider directory, could mislead seniors into choosing plans that their doctors don’t accept. A previous CMS announcement suggests that the directory’s developer is SunFire Matrix, a private equity-owned services platform vendor that sells similar tools to insurance brokers. Integris Health pays $30 million to settle a class action lawsuit related to a 2023 data breach that impacted 2 million people. In England, NHS administrator Sir Jim Mackey requires NHS England’s transformation directorate to personally sign off on readiness before electronic medical records are brought live during the busy winter period. Keep scrolling if health tech history isn’t your thing (or if it is, go deep with Vince Ciotti’s magnificient HIS-tory). Industry veterans will appreciate John Gomez’s insider recap of what onetime frontrunner Eclipsys got wrong during his time as CTO (spoiler: dismissing Epic as being too small to threaten Sunrise Clinical Manager). He generously avoids blaming the unremarkable Eclipsys CEOs who followed founder and industry legend Harvey Wilson through the early 2000s, namely Paul Ruflin and Andy Eckert, neither of whom had recent relevant experience (they must have learned hard lessons since they’ve done fine since in other health tech leadership positions). Then came Phil Pead, who had the savvy to sell publicly traded Eclipsys to Allscripts for $1.2 billion in 2010, only to be fired in 2012 in a power struggle with Glen Tullman. Allscripts was a slow motion car crash under Tullman, but maybe it wasn’t his fault (ever-stumbling Misys was its majority owner) since after the company fired him, he became health tech investing’s golden boy by launching 7wireVentures and unloading Livongo on Teladoc for $18.5 billion in 2020.

It’s sad to see what became of Eclipsys under the list of CEOs you mentioned as well as when they “merged” (um, were pillaged) by Allscripts. I was there for it all. Eclipsys was never really going to be able to beat the big boys but the niche it had carved out worked well for it. But you also have to lay blame for what happened at the feet of Michael Kaufman (SDK) who saw $$$ and an Aston Martin in his eye when he allowed his dad’s company to be sold. Who was Mike’s father? Δ Who was Mike's father? It's sad to see what became of Eclipsys under the list of CEOs you mentioned as well as when they… CHAI is nothing but an attempt at regulatory capture. It's the same bunch of folks who tried to dictate interoperability… Concepts of "new" and "old" are relative in healthcare IT.
