Pay for S&P 500 chief executives rose by 7.7 per cent last year as packages at the US’s biggest companies keep increasing. Median total pay for S&P bosses rose to $19 million (€16.3 million) last year. The jump in median chief executive pay was higher than a 7.2 per cent rise in 2023, according to Farient Advisors, a pay consultancy, and marked the quickest pace of growth since an 11.5 per cent gain in 2021. Total pay for the broader American workforce increased 3.6 per cent in the 12 months that ended December 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “We’re still seeing executive pay increases above the inflationary rate as well as above typical rank-and-file employees,” said Eric Hoffmann, chief data officer at Farient Advisors. The highest paid S&P 500 CEO last year was Rick Smith of Taser maker Axon Enterprise, who raked in $164.5 million mostly from stock awards after meeting targets over several years, according to data provided by MyLogIQ. Brian Niccol, chief executive of Starbucks, was second with $95.8 million in total last year, mostly from stock awards. His pay package included a $5 million sign-on bonus and two one-off stock awards that ranged from $75 million to $80 million to cover forfeited cash and unvested equity he accrued while running Chipotle. Axon did not respond to a request for comment and Starbucks declined to comment. In the UK, median pay for chief executives of the 100 most valuable London-listed companies rose 6.8 per cent to £4.58 million in 2024-25 year on year, according to the High Pay Centre’s annual survey released on Sunday. This is the highest level on record, and the fourth successive year that bosses’ pay has increased. The level of pay for S&P 500 executives has drawn scrutiny from groups that question whether it is exacerbating inequality. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a national trade union, flagged Niccol’s pay package as an example of the widest pay gap between the top executive and median employee of one of the biggest US companies. Niccol’s annual pay was more than 6,666 times greater than the total pay for the median employee, a part-time barista, who earns about $15,000 a year, according to company filings. “We just see ever-growing income inequality in this country, and it’s becoming harder and harder for workers to make ends meet,” said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO. Sarah Anderson, global economy project director for the non-profit research group Institute for Policy Studies, said the widening gap between chief executive and worker pay was bad for democracy. “This gap between CEO and worker pay is a key driver of rising inequality and concentration of wealth at the top. We’re seeing more and more signs of how ultra-wealthy people have too much influence over our political system,” she said. Still, the larger pay ratio between an employee and a chief executive may also reflect a company’s business model. A retail boss is likely to have a wider pay ratio than a technology chief executive who usually hires engineers who are full-time workers. Nvidia, the most valuable US company, reported a chief executive to median employee pay ratio of 166 to 1, with its median employee earning $301,233 compared with CEO Jensen Huang’s total pay of $49.9 million in 2024. Meanwhile, shareholder support for executive pay packages has remained strong. ISS-Corporate found that the median shareholder support for executive pay packages has remained between 92.4 per cent and 92.6 per cent for the past five years. Jun Frank, head of compensation and governance services at ISS-Corporate, said US economic uncertainty may affect executive pay trends in the future.

Title: The Role of Domain-Driven Design in Modern Java Architectures

As Java continues to evolve with modern language features and frameworks, software architecture must also mature. One approach that has stood the test of time—and gained renewed relevance in microservices, modular monoliths, and cloud-native systems—is Domain-Driven Design (DDD). In this article, we explore how DDD principles apply to modern Java applications, what patterns emerge in practice, and how embracing the domain model as a core design driver helps create robust, maintainable software in complex environments. At its core, DDD is not a technical framework, but a philosophy: it encourages developers to align code structure and language with business concepts. Instead of building applications around CRUD operations or database schemas, DDD advocates modeling software based on real-world domains, behaviors, and rules. In the Java ecosystem—where enterprise applications often reflect deeply layered systems—DDD offers a language to manage this complexity while keeping the focus on what matters most: the business logic. The need for DDD is greater than ever: Java, especially with tools like Jakarta EE, Spring, Quarkus, and Micronaut, is well-positioned to support DDD principles across large systems. A bounded context defines the scope within which a particular domain model is valid. In Java, this can map to a microservice, module, or package. The goal is isolation—not just in code, but in language and purpose. One team’s definition of “Order” might differ from another’s, and that’s okay—as long as the contexts are clear. Java developers benefit from strongly typed languages, making it easier to express business rules directly in code. Class and method names should reflect the domain’s vocabulary. This promotes better communication between developers and domain experts and ensures the code remains readable and relevant. An aggregate is a consistency boundary, typically anchored by a root entity. In Java, this aligns with object-oriented principles. However, modern best practices caution against the anemic domain model—where entities are mere data holders—and instead promote rich domain models with encapsulated behavior. Events are a powerful way to model state changes and intentions in a system. In Java, these can be implemented using asynchronous event buses, messaging systems, or even simple publish/subscribe patterns. They decouple components and make the system more observable and extensible. Today’s Java architectures allow for clean DDD implementation without over-engineering. Hexagonal (or “ports and adapters”) architecture, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and event sourcing are all patterns that align naturally with DDD thinking. Frameworks and libraries like Spring Boot, Axon Framework, and even Jakarta EE support these patterns by offering tools to separate concerns and organize business logic meaningfully. While DDD offers a powerful mindset, it’s not a silver bullet. Challenges include: Domain-Driven Design isn’t a trend—it’s a timeless approach to building meaningful, resilient software. In a world where business logic is more complex and systems are more distributed than ever, DDD helps Java developers stay focused on what matters: modeling the problem space accurately and delivering solutions that evolve gracefully. Modern Java provides all the tools needed to make this vision practical—from powerful modularization features and frameworks, to evolving language constructs that support better encapsulation and readability. In embracing DDD, Java teams can bridge the gap between technical excellence and business value—one domain at a time. We will contact you soon. Δ Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
