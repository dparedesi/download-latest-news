September 29, 2025 10:44 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Autonomous Drones" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fast-evolving autonomous drone landscape, examining how advancements in AI, computer vision, and connectivity are propelling drones from risk-reduction tools into core infrastructure for industrial efficiency, safety, and business continuity. It explores how autonomy levels (L1-L5) are enabling zero-touch operations, swarm coordination, and AI-driven mission execution across diverse sectors. Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency, with industries adopting them as critical infrastructure rather than pilot projects. Mining operators are deploying drone-in-a-box ODAS platforms for safety and monitoring, energy firms are using AI-guided drones for real-time emissions detection, and retailers such as Walmart are scaling delivery fleets under supportive frameworks like the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration policy.Momentum is reinforced by investment and innovation. Anduril's funding expands defense autonomy, while Skydio's FAA-approved X10 dock enables fully remote inspections. Pioneers such as Maersk and Voliro are overcoming operational barriers. Patent activity is shifting toward GPS-denied navigation and hybrid aerial-ground drones, while deal values surged to $32.7B in H1 2025, reflecting strong confidence in autonomy-first ecosystems.The report examines sector-specific deployments across defense, mining, energy, retail, logistics, and industrial goods, alongside regulatory developments, market signals, and innovations shaping the next phase of drone autonomy.Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency. With mining companies deploying autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance system (ODAS) drone-in-a-box offerings and energy firms using AI-guided inspection drones, various industries are now entrusting critical safety and asset monitoring to autonomous drone fleets. This is improving efficiency and business continuity. AI and autonomy unlock new productivity frontiers. Innovators like Skydio, whose docked X10 drones are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved for fully remote, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) infrastructure inspections, and energy operators using real-time AI emission detectors, are proving how drone automation can replace manual monitoring with smarter, round-the-clock operations. Investment and hiring surge fuel the ecosystem's scale-up. Anduril raised $2.5 billion in funding in 2025 to expand autonomous defense platforms. This, combined with aggressive hiring from JD.com and Skydio around automation and analytics roles, illustrates how boardroom conviction and workforce expansion are powering rapid advances in autonomous drone platforms and accelerating their commercial rollout across sectors. New policies are unlocking larger-scale autonomous drone operations. With the creation of the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration opening up airspace, firms like Walmart and Vodafone are now scaling autonomous delivery and inspection fleets, moving drone automation from controlled pilots into everyday, revenue-generating business models. Pioneers break through adoption barriers with real-world results. Companies such as Voliro in industrial inspections and Maersk in offshore asset monitoring are overcoming regulatory and operational hurdles through all-in-one autonomous systems and robust policy support, positioning autonomous drones as essential infrastructure for global enterprises.Key Highlights Scope Reasons to Buy Strategic Insights Technology Analysis Innovation Landscape Market Dynamics Sector-Specific Applications Competitive Intelligence Strategic Recommendations With autonomy now operational rather than aspirational, this report equips stakeholders with the intelligence needed to harness drones as a foundation for smarter, safer, and more resilient industries.Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/maas2o About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise’s stock dropped 10% on September 24th following the announcement of its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communication company. This decline was likely fueled by investor concerns regarding the acquisition's price and its potential impact on Axon's increasing expenses. Although Axon has demonstrated strong revenue growth, its operating margin has recently been on a downward trend. In light of this recent stock performance, we will now analyze how Axon compares to its peers in the industrial sector in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins. For context, Axon Enterprise offers conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement agencies worldwide to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence. Why is this important? AXON recently dropped 10.2% in a single day - comparing it to its peers contextualizes stock performance, valuation, and financials - indicating if it is genuinely outperforming, lagging, and most importantly - will this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AXON Stock to determine if Axon Enterprise is indeed a falling knife. Sharp declines frequently present rebound opportunities - observe how the stock has retreated and rebounded previously through AXON Dip Buyer Analysis. While comparing peers is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside exposure. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
