Title: How Stocks Perform After Nasdaq-100 Rebalancing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s that time of year again — the annual rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX). The NDX represents the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. On Monday, three new companies were added to the index, and three others were removed. When a stock is included in a widely followed index, it often generates demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, while removal typically leads to selling pressure. These changes were announced about a couple weeks ago, meaning much of the buying and selling has already occurred. This week, I’m examining what happens once these stocks begin trading in the index. One theory is that the announcement of additions and removals can shift sentiment, and if the initial buying or selling overshoots, it can create opportunities going forward. Before diving into the historical data, the tables below show the stocks that were added as well as those removed. Goin back to 2010, I tracked 80 stocks added to the NDX and 73 removed. We don’t have data on some of the stocks that aren’t trading anymore. I am also only considering stocks added and removed in December during the rebalancing. I will not be considering stocks eliminated and added mid-year due to bankruptcy, mergers, etc. The tables below summarize the returns of the stocks added and removed since 2010. The stocks that were removed performed better than those added. Stocks added to the index in December averaged a return of 3.81% over the next three months, compared to a 7.27% gain for those removed. Over the next three months, less than half the stocks added beat NDX, but 56% of those removed beat the NDX. One year later, the stocks added to the index averaged a gain of about 12%, with 40% of the stocks beating the overall index. Those figures underperform compared to stocks removed from the index, which averaged a pop of 18% over the next year, with 52% of those stocks beating the NDX. Based on these numbers, there could be merit to the theory that sentiment tends to get too bullish for those added, and too bearish for those removed. Next, I incorporated analyst ratings to identify stocks with extreme sentiment. Stocks added to the index are prone to excessive bullish sentiment. Using my historical data, I focused on stocks added that had at least 80% of analysts recommending a "buy" on the day they were added. This may be an indicator of sentiment being too bullish. Conversely, stocks removed from the index can attract excessive bearish sentiment. I analyzed stocks removed with 20% or fewer firms sporting a "buy" rating. If this theory holds, stocks added with bullish sentiment may underperform, while those removed with bearish sentiment may outperform. The numbers in the table below suggest there’s merit to the theory. For those one-year returns, stocks removed where 20% or fewer firms had a "buy" rating averaged a gain of 34% in the next year, with 58% of stocks beating the index. This means it may be worth considering Moderna (MRNA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) as potential stocks to buy. The data below also suggests avoiding stocks that were added that have at least 80% of analysts calling it a "buy." In the next year, these stocks gained less than 5% on average, with just 22% of them beating the NDX. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock was added to the index this year, and all 15 firms call it a "buy." Our data suggests it has an increased chance of underperforming moving forward. MicroStrategy (MSTR) doesn’t meet the criteria of the study, because I only considered stocks with at least 10 brokerages in coverage. However, all eight analysts suggest buying SMCI, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it underperforms going forward. Sign in to access your portfolio

It hasn't been a great kickoff for the newest members of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR), MicroStrategy (MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON) all began the session trading lower on their first day of being included in the prestigious index. The Nasdaq said on Dec. 13 that the three would be part of its index before today's opening bell as part of its annual reconstitution. Also weighing on MicroStrategy shares was the company's update on a stock sale it announced Oct. 30, aimed at raising up to $21 billion, and a new bitcoin (BTC) purchase. It noted in a regulatory filing that between Dec. 16-22, it had sold about 1.3 million shares, valued at $561 million. MicroStrategy added that approximately $7.08 billion of shares remained available for purchase. The largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency also reported that from Dec. 16-22, it had paid the same amount to acquire an additional 5,262 bitcoins. The average price was $106,662, close to the cryptocurrency's all-time high. MicroStrategy explained that as of Sunday, it owned 444,262 BTC. Despite today's selloff, shares of Palantir Technologies and MicroStrategy have skyrocketed 360% and 445%, respectively, this year, while Axon Enterprise shares have jumped 140%. TradingView

Share this article MicroStrategy (MSTR), along with Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (AXON), is officially part of the Nasdaq-100 index ahead of market opening on December 23, according to data from Nasdaq. The three companies will replace Illumina Inc. (ILMN), Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI), and Moderna Inc. (MRNA). As of the latest data, MSTR entered at the 52th position, accounting for about 0.42% of the total market capitalization of all companies in the index, according to data tracked by Slickcharts. The addition comes as part of the Nasdaq-100’s annual reconstitution. MicroStrategy, with a market capitalization of $88.6 billion according to Yahoo Finance data, joins the index of the 100 largest non-financial securities listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart previously predicted that the inclusion could lead to an influx of around $2.1 billion in buying activity from ETFs that track the Nasdaq-100. The company’s stock has surged approximately 476% this year, with shares gaining momentum alongside Bitcoin’s price movements. MSTR stock reached a record high of around $473 on November 20, when Bitcoin traded above $92,000. The inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will require index-tracking funds, including the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), to purchase MicroStrategy shares. This gives QQQ investors indirect exposure to MicroStrategy and its Bitcoin holdings. MSTR shares jumped 11.5% to close at $364 last Friday, rallying with the broader US stock market and offsetting what had been shaping up as a tough week, according to Yahoo Finance. Global markets were shaken by hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $93,000 on Friday before recovering to above $96,000, per TradingView. Despite Friday’s gains, the major indices still closed the week down. The S&P 500 fell about 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average roughly 2.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite around 1.8%. According to a Nasdaq report, while index inclusion typically leads to increased demand and higher valuations, particularly in the short term, the expected benefits are often priced in upon announcement rather than the actual inclusion date.
