Defense stocks were in focus after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, and could present an intriguing opportunity for investors looking to extend Wall Street's tailwinds into February. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) are among the best names to own next month. AXON and NOC averaged impressive February gains of 8% and 4.1% over the past 10 years, respectively, both finishing higher nine times out of 10. From AXON's current perch, a move of similar magnitude would place it above $650 for the first time since December, while NOC could conquer $520 for the first time since November. AXON was last seen down 1.2% to trade at $603.16 at last check, but boasts a massive 139.5% year-over-year lead. The equity has been struggling with overhead pressure at its 40-day moving average since pulling back from its Dec. 6. record peak of $698.67. NOC sports a much more modest 13.9% lead for the last 12 months, but was last seen 0.7% higher to trade at $500.62. The shares are now looking to snap a three-day losing streak and are consolidating above their 60-day trendline. Sign in to access your portfolio
