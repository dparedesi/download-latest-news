ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. In 2017 I visited a small VR startup called AxonVR in Seattle. Founder Jake Rubin showed me concept art for a full body suspension system. A user hung in mid air inside a frame, held in place by a network of supports that allowed the arms and legs to move freely. The idea was simple to state and difficult to build. They wanted to create total immersion by capturing every motion and returning physical feedback across the user’s entire body. It looked like something from a futurist exhibit. It also captured the ambition of a team that believed VR needed more than visuals and audio to be useful. The suspension system never shipped. AxonVR changed its name to HaptX and shifted its focus to haptic gloves powered by microfluidics. The team found immediate demand for precise tactile feedback in robotics, training, and design. Gloves became the company’s core product. Enterprise customers used them to train medical staff, evaluate automotive prototypes, and operate remote manipulators. Defense agencies incorporated them into medic training modules. Robotics groups relied on them for fine motor teleoperation. That focus eventually reshaped the company. HaptX began working closely with a manufacturing group called Advanced Input Systems. The partnership deepened over the years and expanded again in 2024. The gloves became a supported product line inside the broader organization. The combined entity adopted the name 1HMX. Rubin and members of his team became part of the larger company. The resources available to them changed. The manufacturing footprint now spans several continents. The gloves matured into a stable commercial product with a large global customer base. Last week Rubin reached out again. The note contained a link to a new system called Nexus NX1. It launches next week under the 1HMX brand. Rubin told me it is the closest thing the company has ever built to the suspended full body concept they sketched ten years ago. The visual form is different. The purpose is the same. The Nexus NX1 joins three mature products in one turnkey system. The HaptX Gloves G1 provide detailed tactile and force feedback. The Virtuix Omni One provides a platform that enables a user to walk in any direction while remaining stationary in physical space. Freeaim robotic shoes add natural stride and foot movement. The system tracks seventy two degrees of freedom across the hands and body. It captures posture, limb rotation, foot placement, center of mass, and soft tissue movement. It returns real time tactile information from hundreds of points on the fingers and palms. The result is a body scale interface that can control both virtual characters and physical robots. Users can walk, reach, grasp, and lift with realistic feedback. Developers can collect data describing how skilled workers move through complex tasks. Robotics teams can link the system to a humanoid robot and observe how a trained operator performs precise motions. Training groups can use it to rehearse procedures inside simulated environments. The introduction video shows the intended use. A person walks inside the Omni platform. The shoes move with the surface. Every gesture and shift in balance flows through the system. A humanoid robot mirrors the movements. The user receives touch and pressure information through the gloves. It is not a suspended rig. It is grounded. The experience is shaped by the strengths of the components. I asked Rubin how closely Nexus NX1 matches the vision he described in 2017. He said it aligns with the goal the team set when they were still called AxonVR. Full body input, full body output, and real physical response. The form changed. The intention remained. Preorders for Nexus NX1 open November 18 with shipments expected in second quarter 2026. It marks a return to the idea that started the company. AxonVR imagined a full body system before the industry had a way to build it. The version arriving now comes from a far larger organization with the scale to produce it.

Title: ICE has not yet purchased translation technology promised for new agents

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Immigration and Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology that it promised would replace a Spanish-language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials. In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new, “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportation policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week Spanish course. ICE had considered providing officers with AI-powered translation services that can be used on body-worn cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS officials said. The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said. The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides. The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said. “Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.” The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management. The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English. While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology. The police department in Joliet, Illinois, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise. Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages. Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement. “Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News. Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them. In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover. Jason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish-language skills for agents increases the chances of dangerous encounters. “That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said. With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish-language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in Texas, it’s mandatory for all police officers. In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll out body cameras to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to go beyond that initial 1,600. In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say. In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?” In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News. Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.” “Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor. The police department in Corpus Christi, Texas, where less than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer. “It’s very important, because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.” Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training. “Spanish-language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary — it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful and more effective.” Laura Strickler is the senior investigative producer on the national security team where she produces television stories and writes for NBCNews.com.
