ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. AXON Stock Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), best known for its taser and body cams for law enforcement agencies, has had a volatile ride, with its stock falling over 15% in a month, followed by a weakness in broader markets. The S&P500 index is down 8% in a month after the Trump administration’s tariff confirmation on its trade partners including Mexico, Canada, and China. Also, speaking of tariffs, see Trump’s Tariff Policy: The Ripple Effect On Alcoa And Metal Stocks. After its recent fall, AXON stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $560. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AXON stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AXON stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Axon Enterprise along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AXON stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Axon Enterprise has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 351.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 134.2 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Axon Enterprise's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Axon Enterprise has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 30.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 32.4% from $1.5 Bil to $1.9 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 31.7% to $544 Mil in the most recent quarter from $413 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Axon Enterprise's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $114 Mil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 5.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) • Axon Enterprise's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $298 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 15.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Axon Enterprise's balance sheet looks very strong. • Axon Enterprise's Debt figure was $721 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $42 Bil (as of 3/12/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.8% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.2 Bil of the $4.0 Bil in Total Assets for Axon Enterprise. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 28.9% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) AXON stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: The Wiretap: A $60 Million Bitcoin Seizure Shows Cops Are Still Chasing Down Silk Road Dealers

Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas ordered a seizure of a little over 749 Bitcoin, worth about $62.5 million. The order also included hundreds of thousands in various currencies alongside gold coins and bars. According to the Justice Department, these were linked to an illicit operation carried out by two men, one of whom was a drug dealer on Silk Road, the other someone who helped him launder his crypto. (Forbes isn’t naming the men as there are no public charges against them.) Together, they shifted bitcoin obtained from Silk Road deals through various different accounts and converted Bitcoin to cash through LocalBitcoins. Some of the money ended up on Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, which flagged the deposits to law enforcement. What the seizure shows is that while Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht is now a free man after being pardoned by President Trump a day after he came into office, others who sold narcotics on the dark web site remain under investigation and their illicit proceeds are still being hunted down by the U.S. government. It also shows that even years after Silk Road was shuttered in 2015, drug dealers who used it become multi-millionaires have enjoyed the fruits of their labors for nearly a decade.

Worth $150 million when it was pilfered in 2024, the stolen cryptocurrency is now worth as much as $715 million. According to one crypto researcher, the victim was Chris Larsen, cofounder of crypto platform Ripple. Two Chinese nationals were indicted for their alleged involvement in cyberattacks on numerous American government entities and businesses, including a hack of the U.S. Treasury earlier this year. “The defendants allegedly waged a yearslong hacking campaign against U.S.-based organizations to steal their data and sell it to various customers, some of whom had connections to the Chinese government,” said FBI acting assistant director in charge Roman Rozhavsky. The DOJ also announced the takedown of Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions. Prosecutors claimed Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds used in various crimes including hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Elon Musk claimed X had come under a heavy cyberattack, taking the site formerly known as Twitter offline for chunks of the week. Musk claimed the attack originated in Ukraine Ukraine, but experts say the site was the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack, which makes it difficult to determine where it came from. Flock Safety, a provider of AI surveillance technology, is raising $250 million at a valuation of $7.5 billion. Andreessen Horowitz, a previous Flock investor, is leading the round, Bloomberg reports. As Forbes previously reported, Flock has an aggressive expansion strategy, which has sometimes led it to risking breaches of the law. Earlier this year, it found itself at loggerheads with former partner and now fierce rival, Axon Enterprise, the biggest police contractor in the U.S. Consumers have reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a 25% increase over 2023, according to an FTC report. As much as $5.7 billion of that was lost to investment scams. Earlier this week, Forbes reported on one such investment scam, where Trump supporters were duped into believing their Trump-themed coins and memorabilia were worth millions. One woman was convinced enough to send the tricksters $150,000 in “fees,” only for her money to go into the pockets of the scammers.
