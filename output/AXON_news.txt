Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Criminal Justice Eugene Volokh | 1.20.2026 11:36 AM Brief excerpts from today's concurrence in Ellingburg v. U.S., though the whole opinion is worth a read: I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedent. I write separately to clarify the foundation of that precedent. This Court's 1798 decision in Calder v. Bull established that the Ex Post Facto Clauses forbid only those retroactive laws that impose "punishment" for a "crime." Over the 228 years since Calder, the Court has struggled to articulate what it means for a law to impose punishment for a crime, and thus to be subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Court's more recent precedents have implemented Calder through two multifactor tests that turn largely on whether the legislature labels the law as criminal or civil. But in 1798, "punishment" for a "crime" would have been understood to refer to any coercive penalty for a public wrong. Many laws that are nominally civil today would therefore have been subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses under Calder. I would restore Calder's approach to the Ex Post Facto Clauses…. Calder's understanding secures Ex Post Facto Clause protection in a wide range of contexts involving nominally civil laws. Those contexts include civil proceedings seeking fines for public offenses. See, e.g., Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. (2016) (describing "civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day [the challenger] violated the Act"). They include enforcement proceedings brought by administrative agencies. See Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 196 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring) (describing the 20th-century rise of such proceedings). And they include municipal sanctions like speeding tickets. "If one were to commit a minor traffic offense at a time the offense was to be punished by a $25 fine, and the government were to then amend the statute and impose a fine of $1,000,000 dollars, it would be nonsensical to treat that fine as non-punitive simply because the offense was processed civilly." Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as Amicus Curiae. Because all of these offenses impose punishments for public wrongs, Calder would treat them all as subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses.

The non-lethal weapons market is experiencing dynamic growth, with its valuation expected to rise from $8.89 billion in 2025 to $9.65 billion in 2026, maintaining a CAGR of 8.6%. This expansion is driven by increased adoption for riot control and law enforcement, alongside the deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and electric-shock devices. Acoustic and water cannon systems are also seeing rising demand for perimeter security and area denial applications. Looking ahead, the market is forecasted to grow substantially, reaching $12.88 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.5%. This growth is bolstered by investments in advanced non-lethal technologies that promise improved accuracy and safety. There's a rising demand for scalable force options in military operations, alongside developments in smart targeting features and compact device mobility. Innovations also include chemical-free alternatives and enhanced acoustic and light-based deterrents. Fueling this market surge is the increasing frequency of political disputes and civil unrest globally, which is elevating the demand for non-lethal weapons. For instance, from July 2023 to June 2024, there were over 165,273 incidents of political violence, marking a 15% increase. With approximately one in seven people affected by conflict worldwide, the need for effective non-lethal solutions is evident. Companies in this sector are innovating, developing products like non-lethal projectile guns. These tools offer self-defense and crowd management options that minimize lethal outcomes. In March 2023, Guard Dog Security launched the Fireball, a device capable of firing pepper, chalk, and rubber projectiles, emphasizing safety and affordability. In October 2023, Day & Zimmermann LLC acquired Combined Systems Inc., enhancing its portfolio with non-lethal weapon solutions. Major firms influencing the market include Armament Systems & Procedures Inc., FN Herstal S.A., Axon Enterprise Inc., and others, indicating a competitive landscape focused on technological advances and safety. Regionally, North America led the market in 2025, while Asia-Pacific is anticipated to be the fastest-growing region through 2030. However, global trade shifts and tariffs are impacting production costs and supply chains, particularly affecting electroshock devices and impact munitions. These challenges are prompting a shift towards domestic production and cost-efficient systems. A comprehensive market research report provides insights into global market size, trends, competitor analysis, and strategic recommendations, helping stakeholders navigate the non-lethal weapons industry landscape.
