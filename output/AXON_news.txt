Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother’s autopsy report. There it was, one devastating word: “accident.” The papers trembled in her hands. Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold’s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff’s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn’t breathing. How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide. Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner’s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight. “No more silence or complacency,” she thought. “No sweeping it under the rug.” In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died — what’s known as the manner and cause of death. On TV dramas such as “CSI” or “Bones,” facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren’t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police. Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP’s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use — even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted “excited delirium,” a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill. Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon. The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement. The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement. “I call it a crazy quilt,” said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners’ independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge. When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare — of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family’s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher. “I had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you’d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime — police officer or not,” Jen Dold said. “Sadly, we realized this was not the case.” Jen Dold — 11 years older than Alex — had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially. One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left. The county mental health department wouldn’t send someone, saying Dold wasn’t violent enough. When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment. Two Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door. Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold’s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied. Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report. Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill. “It was the worst yelling, shouting I’ve ever heard,” one neighbor told an investigator. After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes. Jen Dold didn’t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother’s mental illness, she thought to protect officers. Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County’s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he’d weigh police force. Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn’t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident. Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold’s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied — Selove used it even though under his own office’s policies intent “need not be present or proven” for a homicide ruling. For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn’t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it — and doing so has “some value” to reduce any appearance of a cover-up. Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization’s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court. The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force. Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother’s death accountable was a lawsuit. Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother’s death, Deputy McGee — the first one into Dold’s home — had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty. The county had settled that family’s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help. As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold’s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it. Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County. Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold’s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident. “I have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,” Adams said. “Why do you say it’s a homicide?” the lawyer asked. “Because when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn’t matter about the intent,” Adams replied. The family hugged. “We just kept saying, ‘Did he really just say that? Did he really just say ‘homicide'?” Jen Dold recalled. Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn’t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove’s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a “danger to public health and safety.” In an interview, Selove said Adams’ homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn’t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him. The county offered Dold’s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn’t budge. She finally relented. “The process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,” she said. When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold’s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records. In the seven years since her brother’s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe. A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner’s report was different by just one word — homicide? While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials — the police chief or sheriff, the mayor — as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers. In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger. Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting. Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, “I think they George Floyded him.” The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state’s chief medical examiner. Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers. “Great day!!” Brave wrote in one. “After our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.” He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as “superhuman strength” and high pain tolerance. Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what’s known as prone position — the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP’s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor. Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson’s death was due to methamphetamine-induced “psychomotor agitation” and “physical exertion with physical restraint.” The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined — one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide. Miller didn’t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn’t trying to influence her — he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages. Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy. In a 2018 “Managing Your Medical Examiner” web presentation, a longtime member of the company’s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. “Control the narrative” by getting the deceased’s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are “hostile,” line up police-friendly experts to counter them. Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not “infallible truth” but rather “driven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.” Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die “walking time bombs.” Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths. One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause. “Dangerously close to intimidation,” the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time. Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association’s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they “suffered consequences,” including being fired. In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be “independent from law enforcement and prosecutors,” and based on scientific evidence and research. Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes. Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show. After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state’s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith’s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification “wrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts … to baselessly vilify police officers.” The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he “was not pressuring anyone” but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages. In March 2019, an officer’s punch fractured a 54-year-old man’s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington’s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor. The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn’s death was tragic but the medical examiner’s report had “confusing and contradictory findings.” Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont. An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement. State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas’ justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties. In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner’s office. The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be. The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field. Briones survived the wreck — but not the night. Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn’t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment. By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late. Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently. The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths — typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system. Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner’s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner’s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide. In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that — at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches — Briones was “morbidly obese.” He ruled the death natural. The Briones family couldn’t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn’t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment. San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP’s database and ruled none a homicide. In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP’s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later — in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake’s death a homicide attributable to tasing. All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County’s four deaths was. Miami’s chief medical examiner declined to comment. The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner’s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother’s death. ___ Weiss reported from Greenville, South Carolina; Mohr reported from Jackson, Mississippi; Dunklin reported from Dallas; Pritchard reported from Los Angeles and Kirkland, Washington.

Title: Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy ends flat after getting Nasdaq 100 nod

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2 per cent of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550 per cent this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7 per cent on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042 per cent lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200 per cent since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics and Hoth Therapeutics have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir and Axon Enterprise, Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina, Super Micro and Moderna. The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Five months later, it's out, and the stock is down 8% on the news. Nasdaq said late Friday that Super Micro is being removed from the index, which is made up of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq and is the basis for the Invesco QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund, one of the most actively traded ETFs. The announcement is the latest in a roller coaster of a year for Super Micro, whose shares rocketed to a record high of $118.81 in March, as demand soared for the company's servers packed with artificial intelligence processors. The company's market cap reached over $70 billion, high enough to merit inclusion in the S&P 500. Super Micro is now worth about $20 billion, about a quarter the size of the median market cap of companies in the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq will also remove Illumina and Moderna from the group, effective Dec. 23. The revision will make room for the additions of Axon Enterprise and Palantir Technologies, as well as MicroStrategy, a company whose value is tied to its billions of dollars worth of bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy shares have gained more than 500% so far this year and were flat in Monday's trading. For Super Micro, the story started to turn in August, when the company said it wouldn't file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company and said in a report that it identified "fresh evidence of accounting manipulation." In October, Ernst & Young resigned as Super Micro's auditor, resulting in a 33% stock plunge. An independent special board committee evaluated concerns from Ernst & Young and found no misconduct following a three-month investigation. The report recommended the company replace its CFO. The company said in November that BDO was its new auditor. Super Micro was at risk of being delisted from Nasdaq altogether for a second time because of its delayed financial reports, but two weeks ago it received an extension until February 2025. In a preliminary earnings report, the company said revenue for the third quarter was up 181% year over year, below consensus. "Competition is strong, but I believe we are in good position," CEO Charles Liang said during a November conference call with analysts. Rivals include Dell and HPE.

MicroStrategy has acquired an extra 15,350 Bitcoin worth around $1.5 billion in cash, pushing its total holdings to 439,000. In an 8-K filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy, a major Bitcoin holder, bought the crypto asset between December 9, 2024, and December 15, 2024, at an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin. With the latest Bitcoin addition, MicroStrategy and its subsidiaries now hold 439,000 Bitcoin, valued at $45 billion. In a post on X, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s CEO, said the Bitcoin was bought for $27.1 billion or an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin. Saylor also noted that MicroStrategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin Yield is 72.4% while its quarter-to-date Bitcoin Yield is 46.4%. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD. As of 12/15/2024, we hodl 439,000 $BTC acquired for ~$27.1 billion at ~$61,725 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/SaWLNBVkrl — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 16, 2024 This is the latest purchase from MicroStrategy. Last week, the company purchased a further 21,550 Bitcoin between December 2, 2024, and December 8, 2024, for around $2.1 billion at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin. This followed a purchase of 15,400 Bitcoin for $1.4 billion the week before. The continued push to buy more Bitcoin comes as MicroStrategy will be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on December 23. In an announcement on December 13 from Nasdaq, it said three companies will be added to its Index: Palantir Technologies Inc., MicroStrategy Incorporated, and Axon Enterprise, Inc. Following the news, crypto analyst Will Clemente wrote on X: “Now that MSTR is getting added to the Nasdaq, every large pension fund, sovereign wealth fund, and individual retirement account in the world is going to have Bitcoin exposure.” The news has also rallied MicroStrategy’s stock price, pushing it up 3%, according to CNBC.

Red Cat shares rallied 27% on news that it's working with Palantir to integrate visual navigation software into its drones. The ticker RCAT has been the sixth-most-popular mention on Reddit's famed WallStreetBets page over the last 24 hours, behind only crypto play MicroStrategy, Nvidia, Tesla, Palantir and SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), according to data tracking firm Quiver Quantitative. RCAT's popularity on WSB has surged more than 1,625% in the past 24 hours, the firm said. Donald Trump Jr.-affiliated Unusual Machines was another big winner Monday, surging about 16%. Kratos Defense and Security Solutions added about 5%. Aerovironment gained 8%. The partnership news comes as recent sightings across the Northeast have reignited interest in the sector, while also fueling national security concerns. FBI officials on Thursday said there was "no evidence" that the drones jeopardize "national security and public safety." Officials also said Saturday that many of the sightings are "manned aircraft being misidentified as drones." Many on Wall Street view the incoming White House administration as a potential boon that could boost funding for the sector and U.S.-made drones. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has spoken favorably of drone technology and is poised to play an influential role in President-elect Donald Trump's White House. "On the drone protection side, federal government counter-drone technologies are increasingly being used by local and state law enforcement to protect stadiums, airports, prisons, and other public settings," said William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma in a note to clients. "This will likely result in a surge in counter-drone investments by local and state government agencies over the next decade." Investors have also come to view ties to the sector through Trump Jr.'s connection to Unusual Machines as another potential tailwind for the industry. The eldest son of the president-elect joined the advisory board of the company in November. Congress has also taken interest in the sector. The National Defense Bill, recently passed in the House, is also drawing interest. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed into law, China-based DJI would be barred from selling new drones to the U.S. — CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: MicroStrategy Stock Jumps On Nasdaq 100 Inclusion—Bitcoin Giant Up 570% This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/12/16/microstrategy-stock-jumps-on-nasdaq-100-inclusion-bitcoin-giant-up-570-this-year/
Time Published: 2024-12-16T14:33:02Z
Full Content:
Shares of MicroStrategy rallied Monday after the corporate bitcoin holder earned a spot in a key stock index, an apparent institutional vote of confidence in the company whose stock has been red hot amid the cryptocurrency boom. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor speaks at a 2021 conference. MicroStrategy stock gained 4% at market open, enjoying a bump from the Nasdaq announcing after Friday’s close that the Virginia-based company would join its Nasdaq 100 stock index next Monday. The inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, which is the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund, should result in about $2.1 billion in net buying of MicroStrategy shares as portfolios adjust to the move, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Also boosting the share price of MicroStrategy, which trades under the ticker MSTR, was a weekend rally for bitcoin, which hit a fresh all-time high Monday of over $106,000; almost all of MicroStrategy’s underlying value is tied to its bitcoin horde rather than a more traditional revenue-based business model. MicroStrategy stock has gained a robust 573% in 2024, outstripping bitcoin’s 150% gain and the S&P 500’s 29% return. Shares of the other two new Nasdaq 100 entrants, Axon Enterprise and Palantir, had less stark reactions, with Taser stun gun maker Axon stock up 1% and analytics-based defense contractor Palantir trading flat. MicroStrategy describes itself as the “world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Part of the dot-com boom at the turn of the millennium, MicroStrategy shifted its focus beginning in 2020 from its software business to becoming the most prominent voice advocating for bitcoin as a long-term store of value akin to gold. The company owns 439,000 bitcoins in its strategic reserve, equivalent to $46 billion, or 2.2% of the world’s total bitcoin supply. Some 40% of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins have been acquired over the last 40 days, according to Chhugani, dating back to the election of Donald Trump, an outspoken bitcoin ally. MicroStrategy has taken the rare step of issuing debt to fund its bitcoin purchases. “If you are not a Bitcoin believer, this is scary, but MSTR’s Bitcoin strategy is a long term high-conviction ‘buy & hold’ strategy with the view to hold Bitcoin till it surpasses Gold and beyond,” Chhugani wrote Monday. MicroStrategy certainly has its critics, including investment firm Citron Research, which announced a short position on MicroStrategy stock last month, calling the stock “overheated” and “completely detached” from bitcoin fundamentals. With a market capitalization of about $100 billion, MicroStrategy trades more than two times higher than its bitcoin holdings, with its other operations hardly offering much further support, as its software business brought in less than $120 million last quarter. 2,700%. That’s how much MicroStrategy stock has returned over the last five years. That easily outranks the roughly 2,200% and 1,600% gains from the S&P’s top performers during that stretch in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk-led electric vehicle company Tesla, respectively, according to FactSet. MicroStrategy’s outspoken founder and chairman Michael Saylor is worth more than $10 billion, making him the 254th-richest person in the world. His net worth has more than doubled since March.

Title: Super Micro's Shocking Fall: Nasdaq Exit, Stock Plunge, and Capital Raise Chaos

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. But the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical. Here's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Club name Honeywell said it is weighing a separation of its aerospace business split, exactly what activist investor Elliott wants. Would be huge for us. Another update on Honeywell's strategic review will come alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares rose more than 3% Monday. 2. Is the market hostage to absurd growth plays like Palantir, Applovin and even bitcoin? In my Sunday column for Club subscribers, I explored this idea. Think about the new additions to the Nasdaq 100. It's not just Palantir and corporate bitcoin holder MicroStrategy. A third one, Axon Enterprise, trades north of 100 times forward earnings. We'll discuss this more during our December Monthly Meeting for Club members on Thursday at noon ET. 3. President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs pledges are increasingly the only thing that business people will talk about, especially the potential for higher levies on goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico. That has been a particularly potent overhang on shares of Club holding Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beer. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

This surge qualified the company for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. On December 13, Nasdaq announced its annual reconstitution of the Nasdaq-100 index, which saw three companies, including MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise, added. The market reacted positively, with MicroStrategy shares rising from $411 at Friday’s close to $434 in Monday’s pre-market trading, Yahoo Finance data shows. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will probably help MicroStrategy achieve its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is expected to have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Monday, as investors looked ahead to an anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cut later in the week as well as several key data releases for clues on monetary policy next year. The Fed's final rate decision of the year is due on Wednesday, with traders pricing in an over 99% chance of a 25 basis point rate reduction, as per CME's FedWatch. Most megacap and growth stocks traded higher, with Google-parent Alphabet up 3.8% and Amazon.com rising 1.3%, boosting communication services and consumer discretionary sectors about 1.5% each. Both the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite touched fresh record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 0.8%. "The Nasdaq 100 has hit a fresh record high, and small-caps are in demand, as the final year-end chase gets underway, this is the 'Santa rally' almost right on cue," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG. Ahead of the Fed decision, investors awaited Tuesday's retail sales data and other key releases scheduled throughout the week. With a rate cut all but priced in, investors' primary focus will be on policymakers' outlook for next year as bets moderate on the pace of rate cuts amid strong economic growth and persistent inflation. "The S&P's year-to-date 26.86% gain far exceeds the average 10.05% annual gain since 1995 ... this jampacked week of important economic figures along with the FOMC meeting could be the game changer," said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial. Stocks have overall had a bumper run in 2024 as gains in artificial intelligence-related companies, the start of the Fed's rate cutting cycle and expected pro-business policies from Donald Trump's incoming administration have lifted equities. S&P Global's December flash PMI showed manufacturing activity stood at 48.3, while services activity was at 58.5, above estimates of 55.7. At 12:13 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.04 points, or 0.01%, to 43,823.02, the S&P 500 gained 24.04 points, or 0.40%, to 6,075.13 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 181.44 points, or 0.91%, to 20,108.16. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury briefly eased from an over three-week high before creeping back above 4.4%. Honeywell International gained 3.3% after the industrial conglomerate said it was exploring a separation of its aerospace business. Tesla leapt 5.4% after Wedbush Securities raised its price target on the stock to a Wall Street high of $515. Crypotocurrency stocks rose as bitcoin jumped above $106,000 after Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, and bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy was set to join the Nasdaq 100 index. MicroStrategy jumped 5%, while bitcoin miner MARA Holdings gained 8.8%. Super Micro Computer, among those set to be removed from the Nasdaq 100, dropped 6.9%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 141 new lows.

Title: MicroStrategy stock surges on Nasdaq-100 inclusion announcement

Investing.com -- MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) shares popped 6% in premarket trading Monday as investors welcomed the Friday announcement from the Nasdaq exchange operator that the stock will be added to the Nasdaq-100 index. The move follows a dramatic rise in the shares of the Bitcoin-focused company. The inclusion will take effect before the market opens on December 23. Being added to the index often boosts a stock price, as funds that track the Nasdaq-100 typically buy shares of the newly included firms to align with the index's composition. In addition to MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), a data analytics firm, and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), known for its Taser products, will also be added to the index. Meanwhile, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing equipment, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which specializes in AI servers, and vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) are set to be removed. MicroStrategy, which has aggressively invested in Bitcoin, has seen its stock skyrocket more than sixfold this year, boosting its market capitalization to nearly $94 billion. The company shifted its strategy in 2020, using Bitcoin as a reserve asset amid declining revenue from its software business. Today, it holds the title of the largest corporate owner of the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that MicroStrategy’s pivot to Bitcoin has made its stock more attractive, as its performance closely mirrors the cryptocurrency's fluctuations. Bernstein analysts predict that the Nasdaq-100 inclusion could pave the way for potential S&P 500 inclusion by 2025. They also see the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding they anticipate "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has surged in recent weeks, fueled by optimism within the crypto sector following US President-elect Donald Trump's victory, which has raised expectations of reduced regulatory hurdles. Earlier this month, the cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time.

Title: Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy jumps on Nasdaq 100 entry

By Medha Singh (Reuters) -MicroStrategy shares briefly surged on Monday before faltering to end nearly unchanged, after the software company and bitcoin stockpiler was selected to join the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, further brightening the prospects of the stock. The $25.7 trillion index that houses the largest non-financial companies will now gain indirect exposure to bitcoin via MicroStrategy, which holds $44 billion worth of the digital currency on its balance sheet, about 2% of the total supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The prospect of more buying from funds that track the Nasdaq 100 could further boost MicroStrategy's stock that has surged nearly 550% this year alongside a jump in the bitcoin price. Its share price rose as much as 7% on Monday before running out of steam to close 0.042% lower It could be "the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot BTC price," said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital. "ETFs such as QQQ and many others would buy MicroStrategy to mirror holdings of the index, therefore driving up the price, and in turn, allowing MicroStrategy to purchase more BTC through debt, bond and equity offerings." The fifth largest U.S. exchange-traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and has $328 billion in assets under management, according to data analytics company VettaFi. Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump suggested he plans to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. MicroStrategy's shares have gained 3,200% since adopting bitcoin as its treasury asset in 2020 under the leadership of co-founder Michael Saylor. The company has more than doubled its bitcoin holdings this year through convertible note offerings and share sales. It reported a net loss of $340 million in the three months ended Sept. 20, its third consecutive quarterly loss. "MicroStrategy's bitcoin strategy is a long-term, high-conviction 'buy and hold' strategy," said Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. The company's market capitalization rose to over $100 billion as its share price climbed, more than twice the value of its bitcoin stockpile. At the close it was valued at almost $98 billion. Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and some small biotech firms including Enlivex Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ENLV) and Hoth Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HOTH) have also decided to allocate portions of their cash to bitcoin. "Longer term, this is a huge milestone for crypto and we are bound to hear the voices, both bulls and bears, get a lot louder talking about MicroStrategy and Saylor in the months to come," Dibb said. Short sellers, or investors betting against MicroStrategy's shares, have lost a total of $9.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Other entrants to the Nasdaq 100 include Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), Nasdaq said late on Friday, replacing Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), Super Micro and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). The reconstituted index will begin trading on Dec. 23.

Photo Credit: Reuters MicroStrategy started buying and holding BTC in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned MicroStrategy will be added to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index, the exchange operator said on Friday, following a meteoric surge in the shares of the bitcoin buyer. The change comes into effect before the market opens on Dec. 23, Nasdaq said. Inclusion in the index typically boosts the stock's price, as exchange-traded funds looking to replicate the index's performance buy shares of the newly included firm. Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Taser maker Axon Enterprise were added to the Nasdaq-100 Index along with MicroStrategy. Gene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina, AI server maker Super Micro Computer and vaccine maker Moderna were removed, Nasdaq said. MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the world's largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than six-fold this year, taking its market value to almost $94 billion (roughly Rs. 7,97,387 crore). The company began buying and holding bitcoin in 2020 as revenue from its software business waned. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Analysts have said MicroStrategy's decision to purchase bitcoin to protect the value of its reserve assets has enhanced the appeal of its stock, which tends to align with the performance of the cryptocurrency. Bernstein analysts expect the market will likely set its sights on S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy in 2025 following the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. The brokerage also sees the company's prospects continuing to improve next year, adding it expects "more visibility and recognition beyond fresh ETF inflows," as a result of the Nasdaq-100 inclusion. Bitcoin has rallied in recent weeks as US President-elect Donald Trump's victory heightened the crypto sector's hopes for easing regulatory roadblocks. Earlier this month, the digital asset catapulted above $100,000 (roughly Rs.84.8 lakh) for the first time. "Management has shown no signs of slowing this (bitcoin-buying) down and are comfortable buying bitcoin in the $95,000 (roughly Rs. 80.5 lakh) - $100,000 (roughly Rs. 84.8 lakh) range," Bernstein analysts said. The company held roughly 423,650 bitcoins bought for about $25.6 billion (roughly Rs. 2,17,148 crore) based on the average purchase price as of December 8. The investment is worth around $42.43 billion (roughly Rs. 3,59,905 crore), based on bitcoin's previous close, according to Reuters calculations. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD. As of 12/8/2024, we hodl 423,650 $BTC acquired for ~$25.6 billion at ~$60,324 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/8r7bFqMFof This means that approximately 46.9% of MicroStrategy’s market capitalization is directly attributable to its Bitcoin holdings at the current price. This leaves about 53.1% of the market cap representing the company’s core business, other assets, and a premium for its Bitcoin strategy. Bitcoin holders have become the passive beneficiaries of passive Wall Street fundsMicroStrategy has joined the ranks of the top 100 companies in the Nasdaq market and has been added to the NASDAQ-100 index.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.
