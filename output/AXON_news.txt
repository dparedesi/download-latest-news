Amazon-owned home security company Ring has partnered with Flock Safety, a company whose network of AI-assisted cameras is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies across the US—just weeks after announcing a similar tie-up with security firm Axon Enterprise. The partnerships will allow police to send requests to Ring camera owners when they're trying to track down footage that could help in an ongoing investigation. The requests must include a specific location and timeframe, as well as details about what is being investigated. This Community Requests feature is optional; agencies can’t see who received a notification or who chose not to respond. You can also turn off Community Request notifications altogether. Amazon previously offered a similar program called Request for Assistance (RFA), which it phased out last year. Though 2,000 police departments across the country were thought to have used the feature, it was dogged by accusations of overreach and misuse among neighbors. Last month, Ring revived the program under the Community Requests moniker. "We believe that when neighbors have simple, secure ways to look out for each other, we all benefit," it said. However, the Flock partnership comes after 404 Media revealed that a division of ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has access to Flock’s nationwide network of AI-enabled cameras. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his office investigated reports of abuse by agencies using Flock technology, and "it is my view that Flock has built a dangerous platform in which abuse of surveillance data is almost certain," he wrote in a letter to Flock's CEO this week. "In particular, the company has adopted a see-no-evil approach of not proactively auditing the searches done by its law enforcement customers because, as the company’s Chief Communications Officer told the press, 'it is not Flock’s job to police the police.'"

Title: Axon Enterprise Stock Dropped 13% – Have You Assessed The Risk

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise (AXON) stock has decreased by 13.3% over the course of 21 trading days. Do you already own this stock, or are you considering purchasing it? You may want to rethink your decision based on the valuation, as the stock appears expensive. Take a look at the following data: While we typically prefer to buy on dips if the fundamentals are sound – for AXON, see Buy or Sell AXON Stock – we also remain cautious about falling knives. Specifically, it's important to evaluate whether we can hold on to the stock if conditions worsen and AXON declines another 20-30% to around $457. What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It turns out that the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We measure this by considering (a) how much the stock declined and (b) how quickly it rebounded. AXON stock has suffered a significant decline recently, and we currently view it as relatively pricey. While this might seem like a buying opportunity, there are substantial risks associated with relying on one stock. Conversely, there is great value in the more diversified approach we advocate with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth manager situated in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation framework to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here are the details, but first, for some context: AXON provides conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence globally. Concerned that AXON may drop further? You might explore the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks that have consistently outperformed its benchmark, encompassing all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother ride, as is clear from the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
