Members Portal A pop quiz of trivia from the previous 19 years of Skeptoid shows! Can you beat the masters? Skeptoid Podcast #1010Filed under Feedback & Questions by Brian DunningOctober 14, 2025 Sponsor an episode! We've just celebrated the 19th birthday of Skeptoid — 19 straight years of weekly shows, and that's pretty cool. So experienced Skeptoid listeners know what that means for today's show: it's time for a pop quiz, with one question from each of the previous 19 years. And no, you don't have to have listened to every show for that long; you just need a good solid foundation of science literacy and critical thinking. Which obviously you have — or you wouldn't be a Skeptoid listener! Keep track of your score; we're going to give you a ranking at the end. So here we go. If you're listening with someone and find yourselves needing a moment to confer after any question, then you are encouraged to push the pause button and deliberate as long as necessary: Of the many pseudoscientific medical benefits professed by some sellers of wheatgrass juice is the false claim that drinking it can remove toxic heavy metals from your system. What medical procedure can actually do this? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, chelation therapy. A chelating agent such as EDTA is administered intravenously and bonds to the heavy metal, which can then be excreted through the urine. American journalist Michael Drosnin shocked the world in 1994 with the publication of The Bible Code, in which he announced that he'd found many historic events foretold in the Bible using a previously undiscovered hidden code. What relatively simple encoding method did he claim was used? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, Equidistant Letter Spacing. Pick a number, say 25, then take every 25th letter from a text. Those letters spell out your messages. Using computer programs, it's been found that virtually any short message you want can be found in virtually any long book-length text using this technique. Before this world's largest scientific instrument came online in 2010, crackpots everywhere were predicting that it would destroy the Earth, by either creating microscopic black holes, strangelets, or magnetic monopoles. It did not do any of those things — but it did help us discover the Higgs boson. Where is the collider located? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, CERN, just outside of Geneva. Fears among the scientifically illiterate became so widespread that lawsuits seeking court orders to stop CERN were filed worldwide. All failed, as none of the plaintiffs were knowledgeable enough to demonstrate any credible threat. Everyone in the country hates changing our clocks twice a year. So what is, in fact, the real reason that we torment ourselves with Daylight Saving Time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, shopping. In much of the country, it's cold for half the year so nobody goes out shopping in the evening anyway; but they do in the summer. Giving them one extra hour before the retailers' closing times means more sales are made and more tax revenue generated. Half of you are going to argue with me on this and say it's one of the others, but the official reasons can be found in my references. In 1966, the Department of Transportation (which is in charge of this for some reason) created the Uniform Time Act of 1966 which stated this as "Convenience of commerce." This region of high radiation, where the inner Van Allen radiation belt dips closest to Earth, got some publicity in 2009 when some blamed its effects for causing the crash of Air France flight 447. Which of the following is true about the South Atlantic Anomaly? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C. The closest the Anomaly dips to the Earth is about 200 km, at which point it's very small; and the highest flying airliners might get as high as 15 km. About 19 years after the Bounty mutineers settled on Pitcairn Island, the island was visited by the crew of an American whaling ship. How many of the British sailors still survived? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one: John Adams. Of the nine British sailors, six Tahitian men, eleven Tahitian women, and one baby who had landed there, only Adams and nine of the women still remained (plus nineteen children) — the others having been killed in fierce infighting. In 2008, a large double-blinded study was done with 21 contestants from the Eighth International Violin Competition using nine top quality violins, ranging from brand new instruments to multimillion-dollar classics including two Strads and a Guarneri (another Italian classic, contemporary to the Strads). The musicians tested exhaustively according to strict protocols in which they could neither clearly see nor smell the instruments they played. Which was the most preferred instrument? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, one of the new violins. The Stradivarius in the test that had the most illustrious history was the least preferred. For that most preferred new one, seven couldn't tell if it was old or new, seven wrongly guessed that it was old, and only three correctly guessed that it was new. Ganzfeld experiments are one type of test for psychic powers. How does this one work? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, one person tries to visualize an object the other person is concentrating on. Proponents consistently claim a better-than-random-chance success rate; skeptics always find methodological errors like inadequate blinding and sensory leakage. When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay summited Mt. Everest for the first time in 1953, it was to some controversy; as many have long maintained that two other British men had succeeded first in 1924, yet died on their return. Who were they? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. If you guessed Eric Shipton, you were close; Shipton was a last-minute cut from Hillary and Norgay's famous 1953 expedition, but he'd been on most of the expeditions since the 1930s. He's best known for being the guy who faked a famous photo of a "yeti footprint" next to an ice axe for scale, which he did in 1951. In 1854, Sir John Franklin embarked upon his fourth and final polar voyage. Unfortunately it ended in disaster: both ships sank, nobody survived, and evidence remained that a few of the survivors may have resorted to cannibalism. Much of this evidence was discovered on what island? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Beechey Island in the Canadian Arctic. This voyage was to find a fabled Northwest Passage, a way to sail between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via an ice-free route through the Arctic Ocean across the top of North America, rather than having to go halfway round the world to traverse Cape Horn. So islands in the Canadian Arctic were the only possible correct answer. This small forested grove in Romania is only about 3 km². It was made famous to Americans in 2014 when a team of TV ghost hunters drove into it. One pretended to have an unprovoked panic attack. They brought along a commercially sold ghost hunting detector device, which detected nothing. They panicked and fled. While their contribution to the mythology was essentially meritless, they did bring up one case of a 5-year-old girl who went missing in the forest once. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, the area of the park is so small that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to go missing within it. Consequently there are no records of it ever having happened. The first emperor of a unified China left a lot to remember him by, not just the original Great Wall of China, but also his vast mausoleum complex, home to the Terra Cotta warriors, a vast map of the world in miniature complete with liquid mercury representing its oceans, and a massive central pyramid. Which of these three pyramids is the largest, by volume? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B, Qin Shi Huang's pyramid was indeed the biggest of these three, by volume. At 3.1 million m³, it was about 20% bigger than the Great Pyramid of Khufu at 2.6 million m³. Although Monk's Mound has about the same footprint as the Great Pyramid, it's only about a quarter the volume. The world's biggest is the Great Pyramid of Cholula in Mexico, at 4.5 million m³. The so-called Baghdad Battery is a small terra cotta pot discovered in 1936, probably between 1300 and 2200 years old. Its designation as a battery (which is obviously false) has come from alternative historians and ancient advanced culture theorists. What is it really? Reveal the answer The correct answer is B. It's essentially identical to many other scroll containers, many of which have been found with their scrolls intact. The giveaway is the residue of asphalt around its lip, which was used to seal such containers and preserve the scrolls within. If you visit the Catherine Palace south of St. Petersburg, you can go and visit a faithful replica of the fabulous Amber Room, gifted to Peter the Great in 1716 by King Frederick William I. The original was initially lost in World War II, during the scuffle to hide artworks and other treasures from the invading Nazis in 1941. What was ultimately its fate? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, it was destroyed when the advancing Red Army razed Königsberg Castle in Germany, burning it completely to the ground in 1944. The room had been on display there, and the German curators disassembled it and packed it into nondescript crates for evacuation — but it was too late. Unfortunately for the Soviets, the average infantryman knew or cared little about current developments in art history. It's reasonably well known that the Holy Grail became a part of Christian mythology after the Bible; it came from Arthurian lore. In what publication did the principal character Perceval make his first appearance, so far as we've been able to find? Reveal the answer The correct answer is C, The Story of the Grail from 1190. Following Geoffery of Monmouth's book, the 1100s were full of pulp fan fiction about King Arthur, and it does appear that this poem is where Perceval and the Grail both made their debuts. Interestingly, it is incomplete, as its author literally died mid-sentence. And OK, yeah, this was probably too hard of a question. In 1959, Canada's magnificent Avro F-105 Arrow was inexplicably canceled. Only a few having been built, then immediately destroyed, the Arrow was the world's best and most advanced interceptor: capable of taking off, pursuing and overtaking enemy bombers, and shooting them down. The reason was that, with the advent of ICBMs, interceptors were simply no longer relevant. The conspiracy theories melt away when you note that an American interceptor concept, largely identical to the Arrow, was canceled at about the same time. What was it? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, the XF-108 Rapier, from North American. This is kind of an unfair question if you're not an aerospace nerd. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie was a bomber, not an interceptor; and the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar was a proposed spaceplane, a followup to the record-setting X-15. Yes, it had a dumb name, because it sounded like "dinosaur", but it was Dyna (like dynamite) and Soar (like fly). JPL co-founder Jack Parsons is somewhat notorious for his lifestyle outside of work, in which he led a chapter of a mysticism order from his large house in which some of the members lived, called the Parsonage. What future cult leader lived at the Parsonage for a time? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, L. Ron Hubbard, who went on to found the Church of Scientology. Hubbard and Parsons' girlfriend, Sara "Betty" Northrup, ran off together with $10,000 of Parsons' money. Nibiru is said to be the name of a rogue planet that could swing past Earth at some point and cause massive destruction. Other stories surround the so-called Planet X. Planet X and Nibiru are not the same thing; both have distinct backstories and predictions associated with them. They could be purely fictional, or they could be theoretical, based on actual astronomical observations. Which of the following is true? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, Nibiru is fictional and Planet X is hypothetical. Nibiru was the brainchild of broad-spectrum wooist and alternative historian Zecharia Sitchin, who published it in a fact-free book series called The Earth Chronicles, which started with The 12th Planet in 1976. Planet X, on the other hand, was the name given by famed astronomer Percival Lowell to a hypothetical body that he (and others) believed would account for perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. For quite some time after his death, the subsequent discovery of Pluto was believed to account for this. That was later disproven, but only when the Voyager 2 mission made better measurements of Neptune's mass, many decades later. "Excited delirium" is a cause of death sometimes attributed to people who died being arrested, usually young black men. It is not a real medical diagnosis and its origin has been traced to the manufacturer of what police equipment? Reveal the answer The correct answer is A, tasers. The condition was first described in a white paper published by the American College of Emergency Physicians, written by a task force, three of whose members were found to have been consultants paid by Taser International, since renamed Axon Enterprise. Some states are now banning "excited delirium" from being listed as a cause of death. OK, let's see how you did!

A subscription may be required for some services. Share The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, and with the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we're reminded that turning this potential into enterprise reality requires a robust, open ecosystem built on choice and collaboration. Our goal has always been to provide a consistent, powerful platform for AI that works with any model, on any accelerator, and across the hybrid cloud. Today, we're thrilled to highlight the momentum from our partners, who are working alongside us to build out the future of open, hybrid AI on Red Hat. The Red Hat partner ecosystem is the engine that will deliver the generative AI (gen AI) and agentic capabilities that customers need for broad market adoption. It’s about bringing together the best in hardware, software, and services to create a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. The launch of Red Hat AI 3 is centered on driving enterprise AI inference, expanding model choice and enabling open models for optimized cost and flexibility – so organizations can go from training to “doing.” And Red Hat partners play a critical role in making this happen. To deliver AI inference at scale using vLLM and Kubernetes, the llm-d open source project is now generally available as part of Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0, powered by a coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerators and premier AI cloud platforms. Founding contributors include CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research, and NVIDIA, with additional support from partners like AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda, and Mistral AI. Since the project’s introduction earlier this year, Microsoft, Oracle and WEKA have also become active contributing members. Nilesh Patel Chief Strategy Officer, WEKA As Large Language Models (LLMs) become the foundation for a wide range of gen AI applications, Red Hat is introducing the Partner Model Validation Guide to empower our partners and provide greater choice to customers. This guide outlines a standardized, step-by-step process for Red Hat partners to benchmark their LLMs for inclusion in the Red Hat OpenShift AI model catalog. Leveraging the Partner Model Validation Guide, model provider partners can generate the data needed for validation using a prescribed open source toolchain, including vLLM for serving, GuideLLM for performance benchmarking, and LM Evaluation Harness for accuracy evaluations. Once submitted and validated by our team, these partner models, complete with their performance and quality metrics, will be made visible and available to all Red Hat OpenShift AI customers. This initiative enriches our model catalog, offering customers more transparent insights and guidance at the model level, a broader selection of best-in-class open source models to build their AI applications, and market visibility for our model provider partners. Ultimately, the goal is to get AI applications into production where they can deliver business value. Red Hat AI, combined with our partner ecosystem, provides the essential capabilities for developing, deploying, and managing agentic AI. This is where our systems integrators and services partners play a crucial role. Red Hat is engaged with global leaders like Accenture, HCL, Kyndryl, IBM Consulting, Infosys and NTT DATA to support customers in scaling these applications and optimizing inference to run AI everywhere – from the datacenter to the edge. With a solid foundation and enabled infrastructure, the focus shifts to the tools and models that power intelligent applications. An AI strategy is only as good as the ecosystem of data platforms, vector databases, security tools, and developer utilities that support it. Red Hat’s partner landscape is rich and diverse, providing the essential components for building modern AI workflows. With the launch of Red Hat AI 3, we've curated a collection of MCP servers. This enables ISVs to connect their tools and services directly to Red Hat AI. Partners like CyberArk, Dynatrace, Elastic, EnterpriseDB, Palo Alto Networks, and others are working with Red Hat to showcase their MCP servers, helping customers build sophisticated agentic applications with trusted tools. Steve Kearns General Manager, Search Solutions, Elastic Wolfgang Heider Product Lead Software Delivery, Dynatrace Red Hat’s work with Meta’s open source Llama Stack is foundational to empowering developers with Red Hat AI 3. By actively contributing to this open source project, Red Hat and its partners are helping to enhance a complete set of standardized tools that revolutionize the gen AI application lifecycle. This helps ensure developers have a compelling, robust, and adaptable environment to accelerate the creation and deployment of innovative AI solutions, giving our partners and customers a clear path to production. By reducing the complexity of integrating various AI services and tools, Llama Stack enables developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure challenges. Options are important to cover the widest range of capabilities, which is why we've deepened our collaborations with accelerator partners like AMD, Google Cloud, and Intel. We’re working with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s performance-optimized AI computing, networking, and software with Red Hat AI, helping customers to build, deploy, and manage AI at scale and optimize infrastructure across diverse workloads. Red Hat and NVIDIA continue to drive the expansion of AI infrastructure with the support for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 infrastructure, targeting high-end AI training and inference at scale. Furthermore, the NVIDIA RTX PRO(R) 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs support Red Hat AI, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, accelerating a range of enterprise workloads, including enterprise AI and VDI graphics, with air-cooled GPUs and servers. Our collaboration with AMD is powering more efficient gen AI by enabling AMD’s portfolio of x86-based processors and GPUs on Red Hat AI, driven by our activations in upstream communities like vLLM and llm-d to deliver enhanced performance and GPU support. In addition, Red Hat continues to build upon its longstanding collaboration with Intel to support Red Hat AI across its expanding hardware platform and accelerator portfolio, including Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators. This commitment to choice extends across the hybrid cloud. In this area, we are actively working with Google Cloud to bolster TPU support on Red Hat AI, extending our shared vision for community-powered innovation through projects like llm-d and vLLM. But accelerators are just one piece of the puzzle. Customers need validated, integrated solutions. That's where our OEM server partners come in, transforming the theoretical potential of AI into tangible enterprise reality. While the foundation of AI lies in accelerators on the bottom and language models on the top, the practical deployment and management of AI at scale requires robust, integrated solutions. Red Hat is actively collaborating with industry leaders, including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, and Lenovo, to simplify the deployment and management of AI across hybrid cloud environments. With Dell, we are working to help ensure that their powerful server and storage solutions are optimized for Red Hat AI, providing customers with reliable and scalable infrastructure for their AI workloads. This includes joint efforts to enable Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift AI for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, which brings together optimized hardware and software capabilities to drive more seamless AI deployments that can handle the most demanding computational tasks. Similarly, our collaboration with Cisco combines their strengths in networking, security, compute, and observability with Red Hat OpenShift as the application platform for containerized AI workloads within Cisco AI PODs, the core AI infrastructure building block of Cisco Secure AI Factory with NVIDIA. Red Hat AI builds on this foundation to deliver a consistent, automated environment for AI model development, training, and inferencing. The result is a full-stack AI platform that is scalable, high-performing and secure. We are expanding AI infrastructure reference designs and offerings across our entire infrastructure ecosystem. These collaborations are essential in providing customers with the comprehensive solutions needed to operationalize AI, helping ensure that the necessary hardware, software, and services can be integrated to accelerate AI adoption and innovation. Our vast ecosystem of global distributors and value added resellers (VARs) is instrumental in building repeatable solutions at scale for the enterprise. Partners like Ahead, Arrow, TD Synnex, WWT, and many others are aligning to Red Hat AI within their solution portfolio. Neil Anderson Neil Anderson, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Cloud, World Wide Technology Through strategic collaborations with partners across hardware, software, and services, Red Hat is providing a consistent, powerful platform for AI that offers choice and flexibility across the hybrid cloud.
