Title: Trump’s Win Was Great for Stock Markets—but Not Everyone Saw a Boom

Although America’s CEOs and financiers largely condemned Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot in 2021, they all but made peace with his political return this year—tempering their onetime critiques of the candidate and the GOP, hedging their bets in the lead-up to Election Day, forbidding their media apparatuses from endorsing Kamala Harris, and lining up to kiss the ring soon after Trump’s win became clear. The money spoke, as it always does in U.S. elections, and the returns are pouring in for this newfound era of “Trump trades” that capitalize on democratic decline and power consolidation. After Trump’s victory speech, capitalism’s hype machines—with the notable exception of the bond markets—roared with approval. Every major traditional stock index surged to record heights after Election Day and has kept up the rally, so far. Cryptocurrencies are headed to the moon, as Bitcoin’s all-time-high valuations shower blessings upon the broader virtual-asset sector, and as Trump’s own crypto venture promises to launch its own dollar-backed stablecoin. That “digital gold” has triumphed over real gold, and the U.S. dollar remains as strong as ever. Meme stocks (like Trump’s own Truth Social) and memecoins (like Dogecoin, the favorite of one Elon Musk) keep going up, up, up; the WallStreetBets boys are having the time of their life. (Curiously, however, Trump-themed memecoins aren’t doing as hot.) And the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech stocks that kept the markets aloft this year are celebrating. Indeed, the only thing left for traders to consider right now is whether they’re being too exuberant, and whether Trump will, you know, actually follow through on any of the things he said he’ll do. At least so far, the bonanza arises from several favorable factors for America’s private titans. Trump, of course, is as business-friendly as ever, welcoming all sorts of CEO advisers for his governmental transition. There are federal contract opportunities aplenty. The Federal Reserve is finally taking interest rates down bit by bit, adding some vigor to a sluggish investment environment. Moguls disaffected with the Biden administration’s antitrust philosophy and meager attempts at corporate tax increases are already hungry for lower taxes, slashed regulations, revolving-door Cabinet members, more mergers, and more acquisitions. Case in point: the leap in Live Nation’s investor confidence after its CFO expressed hope that the government’s antitrust lawsuit would be tossed out soon. (Sadly, despite the affection she curries among Vice President–elect J.D. Vance and his fellow “Khanservatives,” the aggressively pro-competition Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan is unlikely to last in her role. Remember, Trump’s anti-corporate actions in his first term were always more retaliatory than philosophical.) That doesn’t mean everyone’s a winner, though. Stocks for companies in industries that Trump has repeatedly attacked—renewable energy, vaccines—understandably sank. Shares for retailers in consumer goods (clothes, household appliances, etc.) and for real estate also settled a touch lower: The postelection dollar jump escalated mortgage rates, and executives in both sectors are worried about the impacts of mass deportation plans and hiked tariffs. (The inhumane immigration crackdown would have the side effect of draining the labor force; the increased tariffs would raise costs on imported materials.) Health care valuations in general underperformed in the markets, likely due to jitters around the future of Obamacare. Plus, oil and its manufacturers aren’t doing as great as you might think, even as their bets paid off on a president-elect who so directly demanded their dollars and loyalty. Of course, all of this is a crass exercise on the part of America’s financial class, a heaping sacrifice of vulnerable Americans and democratic bulwarks for the sake of “number go up.” Still, one thing that “Trump trades” can demonstrate is a map of reliable indicators of who wants (and expects) to profit from the return of this insurrectionist maniac, as well as whether they’ll find themselves sunk in the longer term when Trump’s loyal advisory team once again does something economically heartless and stupid. These are the public companies to keep watch over throughout the next few years, the biggest Trump bettors that will soon find out whether “doing business with Hitler” was worth it after all: The cryptocurrency industry spent so much money in this race that they’ve all but bribed and ensured future loyalty from a bipartisan swath of lawmakers. Trump himself was quite attentive to “your Bitcoin, your crypto, and everything else that you’re playing with” this election cycle: speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, launching his own NFT “trading cards,” and even helming his own flopping crypto trading business, World Liberty Financial. More importantly, there’s the inevitability that Trump and a paid-off Congress will shove aside the Biden era’s aggressive regulators, like Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, and allow the digital assets sector to freely prey on more retail investors and promulgate more scams. Here are the funny-money investors who have arguably benefited the most so far: Microstrategy: The Bitcoin software company also got a nice postelection bump, with Trump’s victory leading its key currency to never-before-seen thresholds. To celebrate, Microstrategy made its largest Bitcoin purchase since 2020, scooping up about $2 billion worth of that digital gold and announcing a massive new fundraising round. Nvidia: Energy-intensive Bitcoin mining requires the types of processors that Nvidia has specialized in from the beginning—an early specialty that’s helped it to become a multitrillion-dollar company in the age of energy-intensive A.I. training. So the processing unit manufacturer has a lot to look forward to. Coinbase: CEO Brian Armstrong was the single most significant organizer (and funder) of the 2024 election cycle’s crypto lobby, and his publicly traded digital exchange—which also holds a federal contract with the U.S. Marshals and is also fending off an SEC suit that would require most crypto tokens to be registered as securities—has enjoyed a nice postelection surge. Speaking of supporters who stand to profit … Tesla: CEO Elon Musk’s role as campaign surrogate and likely government adviser gave his biggest company a fiery boost from investors, and his already sky-high net worth ballooned as a result. (Tesla stock remains the primary driver of his wealth.) No, it doesn’t matter that Trump doesn’t care for electric vehicles or charging stations; Tesla is already pivoting toward robots and sure-to-be-faulty robotaxis. Bonus: Tesla, along with Musk ventures like SpaceX, likely won’t have those pesky federal rules and regulations and unions to deal with. (Not to mention, those federal lawsuits over racism at Tesla’s workplaces.) Big banks: Bank stocks are back up, baby. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon kept mum about the race except to vaguely claim that Trump was “kind of right” about certain issues; the stock is doing great. Back in October, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executives salivated over the possibility of increased corporate consolidations throughout 2025; their investors are also ready to take that bet, post-Biden. The CEOs of Citi and Bank of America both met with Trump in June; the former, at least, is ready for Trump to cease the government’s regulatory scrapes with Citigroup. So are investors. (Worth noting: Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were also among the seven banks that helped finance $13 billion of Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover.) Energy Transfer: The CEO of the firm behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline poured $5.8 million into Trump’s campaign and is likely to reap the benefits from the fossil-fuel-loving, environment-hating president. Investors certainly believe so. Palantir: The generous provider of A.I. surveillance tech, military intelligence services, and data analysis tech is operated by one of Trump’s biggest fans (chairman Peter Thiel), so investors are expecting even more federal partnerships to come. Even though CEO Alex Karp backed Kamala Harris, he’s mad enough about campus protesters—and content enough with the coming contract opportunities—that he probably isn’t too bothered by Trump’s win. Joe Lonsdale, a Palantir co-founder and financial backer of conservative causes, is definitely happy all around. It’s not just defense interests looking forward to what spoils Trump may bring. Private prisons: Barack Obama vowed to phase out private prisons during his presidency, so of course the incarceration business celebrated when Trump first won in 2016 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed course. Operators like Geo Group and CoreCivic have had even more to celebrate this round, as Trump’s mass deportation plans will likely help to fill their cells; their stocks were thrilled by the president-elect’s announcement that he would appoint former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan, known to be the “father” of Trump’s family separation policy, as the incoming administration’s “border czar.” (By Monday, both companies’ stocks were up 75 percent from Election Day levels.) Axon Enterprise: The tech business formerly known as Taser International—yes, as in that type of Taser—saw a big jump after Election Day, thanks to likely accurate perceptions that Trump will continue to militarize our police forces (and also deputize local forces to help round up immigrants). Immigrants, both legal and “illegal,” are some of the biggest contributors to American prosperity and world standing, but look, there are folks who stand to profit from their persecution. Racial capitalism wins again. Perhaps most depressingly, what all these “Trump trades” show is that there is nothing too extreme for America’s plutocrats to abide—not an attempted coup, not open bigotry and baseless fearmongering, not convictions of sexual abuse, not even the country’s perceptions around the world. The “free market” was never going to preserve democracy. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time.

Title: How CFOs Can Adapt Their Budgeting To Today’s Economic Reality

Plus: Wall Street Looks Forward To Fewer Regulations, Republican Election Wins Rally Markets, Crypto Prices Soar, Why Tax Cuts Might Take Some Time Investors, bankers and dealmakers are celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory last week. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes why: Republicans are known for being more business-friendly and less likely to enact strict regulations. And Donald Trump, who has made his distaste for regulations crystal clear, will have a Republican Senate and potentially a Republican House of Representatives to get his policies through. Many in the business world are hopeful Trump keeps his campaign promise of generous corporate tax cuts, and can fill the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission with leaders who will give more flexibility to business. Regardless of who won the election, 2025 was already expected to be a return to more active financial times. Inflation has moderated, interest rates have been slashed, markets are booming and the economic climate is right for M&A, IPOs and fundraising. Tight bank regulations enacted during the global financial crisis were being eased. Those are expected to be much less onerous now. “I consider this a watershed moment in turning the page for bank regulation. The post-Global Financial Crisis period is now over,” longtime Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo told Tucker. “The pendulum had already started to swing back, but now it’s likely to swing back even more.” But while businesses expect happier days, there are also potentially dark clouds on the horizon. On the campaign trail, one of Trump’s major economic plans was drastically increasing tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.—-potentially going as high as 100% for China or Mexico. Economists from differing philosophical backgrounds warn that would make everything more expensive for everyone in the U.S. While Trump has said this will force other countries to pay more to the U.S., Forbes’ Cyrus Farivar writes that tariffs don’t work that way in practice. Companies pass higher import duties to consumers, increasing the prices of all goods. Consumers respond by buying less. According to an analysis from the National Retail Federation, the effects of tariffs Trump’s proposal will be “dramatic,” especially since many products that are made in the U.S. use foreign-made components or materials. Some U.S. companies are scrambling to increase their imports—especially from China—to beat any tariffs before Trump takes office. Even without the presidential election, a global pandemic, supply shortages, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheaval have rapidly changed the business environment in the last five years. This has created many changes in the budgetary process. I talked with Andy West, a senior partner at McKinsey and global co-leader of its Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice, about how CFOs can adapt. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week, after the election. With Republicans’ ballot box victories came new highs for the stock market. Last week was Wall Street’s best of 2024, with all three major indexes rallying—the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.6%, the S&P 500 rose 4.7%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.7%. All three indexes continued consistent growth on Monday. The S&P crossed the 6,000 mark on Friday, and stayed there for much of Monday. But the gains were not just for the largest public companies. The Russell 2000 was up 8.5% last week. One of the companies that saw the most movement was Tesla, whose market cap passed $1 trillion on Friday for the first time since 2022. Since the election, the company’s stock is up about 35%. CEO Elon Musk’s supercharged support for Trump—both on the campaign trail and as one of his largest political donors, providing the campaign about $130 million—helped drive Tesla’s rally, which appears to be cooling off a bit today. However, Tesla isn’t the biggest Trump beneficiary on the stock market, nor is it the only one seeing its fortunes rise from Trump’s campaign trail priorities. Private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group—both of which are Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors—have seen their stock up 76% and 75%, respectively. And Taser parent Axon Enterprise has seen 40% growth. Adding fuel to the economic fire was the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates by 0.25% at its meeting last week, bringing them to 4.5% to 4.75%. Unlike the market rally, the cut had nothing to do with the election. It was widely expected due to falling inflation rates—which were down to 2.1% last month, according to the Commerce Department—and a 4.1% unemployment rate. However, analysts cautioned that the Fed’s planned wind-down of interest rates, which were hiked due to high inflation that peaked in 2022, may not unfold as initially anticipated due to the uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans. Chesnot/Getty Images Cryptocurrency is also seeing a gigantic boost from Trump’s win. Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, has seen its price skyrocket to more than $86,000 since Trump’s election. Trump ran as a cryptocurrency-friendly candidate, promising to fire Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler and roll back regulations on cryptocurrency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. Trump has also said he would like to create a strategic national bitcoin reserve. With the election of blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno as a new Republican senator from Ohio—unseating former Senate Banking Committee and strict cryptocurrency regulation supporter Sen. Sherrod Brown—it could be easier for pro-cryptocurrency laws to get through Congress. Trump’s family also stands to personally benefit from looser regulations on cryptocurrency. In September, he started a new cryptocurrency business venture called World Liberty Financial. It’s run by his older sons Don Jr. and Eric. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on Tuesday. With Republican control of the White House and at least the Senate, fast tax cuts are expected. Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb writes that tax cuts are likely on the way, but it may take a while before they’re reflected in what businesses are paying the government. It has to do with the budgetary processes in Congress. While Republicans will have a majority in the Senate, most bills they bring up will be able to be filibustered by Democrats—a strong likelihood in this case. A majority of senators can consider financial bills through a process called reconciliation, which has special rules. These bills can only deal with spending and revenues for a limited time, meaning they usually have to expire—which is why tax cuts from Trump’s first term are sunsetting in 2025. And even with broad agreement on the big things, it does take some time to get agreement on the details. Erb points out that the previous round of Trump tax cuts wasn’t approved until December 20, 2017, nearly a year into his term. McKinsey Senior Partner and Global Coleader of Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice Andy West. After about a decade of relative stability, the last five years have delivered financial uncertainty to companies as pandemics, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheavals have impacted businesses across the globe. That’s changed the CFO’s budgeting process significantly, and leaders who do better recognize that some of these issues should be seen as more permanent conditions, said Andy West, senior partner and coleader of McKinsey’s Global Strategy and Corporate Finance practice. I talked to him about some of the changes in the CFO’s budgeting process. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some of the bigger issues to address as CFOs are putting together budgets right now? West: The biggest is around granularity, in terms of how granular you need to be when making decisions. Instead of wrapping it up in a product line or a business unit, and talking about things like total revenue, as you have impacts like inflation on price, or supply chain risk on volume, [you should be] decoupling that in price and volume. What are our assumptions and how do we think about that? In a multi-business company, multiple product lines are completely affected by these risks. Some may be status quo, others might be having a massive impact on the supply chain and can no longer price or supply the way that we expected. The specificity with which budgets need to be evaluated is increasing in a lot of different ways. We also see an expansion from just financial metrics to finance and operating-driven metrics. I have a client that [is] a contract manufacturer. For them, instead of just setting budgets, they need to bound their financial budgets by what’s operationally feasible. You used to be able to say, ‘I’m just going to set a budget 10% higher than last year, and that seems right.’ Now we have to understand our aspirations for spending 10% higher than last year. Is that consistent with what’s happening with our unit costs? If you are setting a budget that is impossible to execute, you need to know that. That was not a factor before. You knew that last year was going to be the same as this year. That level of de-layering is really important. The last one that is really interesting is cadence. The annual budget cycle used to be [on a regular] cadence, which is a year. What you’re seeing now is that’s insufficient for the amount of risk and uncertainty in the world and the budget. They’re either managing that with holdbacks and then they’re releasing budgets as they go, or they’re changing the cadence and saying, we’re going to do quarterly budgeting. What is most interesting is organizations that are getting more granular are also thinking about the cycle in a more granular way. Old business, same assumptions, that’s the good old yearly cycle, and we’re going to do it the old way because the new way is more expensive and more complicated to execute. But these two strategic initiatives are going to be on a faster flywheel and we’re going to look at them in isolation in order to manage the risk. This new budgeting strategy is a departure from how things have been done in the last 10 to 15 years. But all of this uncertainty is not a unique occurrence for business in general. What time periods could CFOs learn from? There will be a handful of executives who were making business decisions in the 1970s. I think when we look at the different eras of business and economic performance, one of the things that typically draws us back to that era is [the] supply constraints that we’re dealing with right now. Supply of energy, scarce resources, less economic stability, a bit more polarization in the world. Where we are right now is a different era than the ‘70s, but if you go back to some of the fundamentals and how long it took to work through things like energy supply—which was a big problem in the ‘70s—it took years. I think that’s the situation that we’re in right now: Years to get the budgeting updated, years to pivot on strategy, years to find a way to manage around some of the global issues. I think we’re seeing a fairly resilient consumer right now, but until we work through these structural challenges, we are still going to have some uncertainty. What advice would you give to a CFO working through this process? Take it seriously. The changes you’re making now are a lot of work, but it will lead you to an inherently better place because the world’s likely not going back. These changes are a good thing. I would say keep granularity in mind. It is really important for the CFO and the finance function to help the organization understand performance and make sure that resources are being reallocated accordingly. And I would also say embrace the strategic moment. CFOs have, for the last decade, become closer and closer to general operators, and become more and more strategic. This is only a continued evolution of their role and an opportunity to lean into the moment.

Title: Tesla Stock Dips 2% As Post-Election Surge Cools Off

Shares of Tesla slipped Tuesday as part of a broader cooling off among the hottest trades following last week’s election of Donald Trump, though the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker remains far more valuable than it was prior to Election Day. People look at a Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership in Manhattan. Tesla stock fell 6%, its first daily loss since last Monday. That pares Tesla’s post-election gain to a still eye-popping 31%, as investors flooded into the stock following Trump’s victory on optimism about what Musk’s close alliance with Trump would mean for Tesla. “The magnitude” of Tesla stock’s post-election surge “surprised us,” Deutsche Bank analysts led by Edison Yu remarked in a Tuesday note to clients. Accompanying Tesla’s slip Tuesday were losses for some other assets which rallied after the Trump win. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase lost 2%, the stock of Axon Enterprise, the Taser stun gun parent which was the only S&P 500 company to outperform Tesla from Election Day through Monday, dipped 3%, private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group sank more than 5% apiece and analytics-focused defense contractor Palantir slipped 1%. Major indexes were only down slightly, with the S&P and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both losing less than 0.3%. “Elon Musk’s emergence from a political ‘outsider’ to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla’s journey beyond autos,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a Tuesday note to clients. American leadership in Tesla’s core ambitions like electric and autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robotics “is going to involve government and industrial partnership on a scale some have compared to the Manhattan Project, US Highway Act or the Apollo Missions,” Jonas added. Musk’s net worth fell by about $12 billion Tuesday as Tesla shares fell. His $308 billion net worth is still more than $75 billion higher than the next-wealthiest person in the world, Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, while Musk is still almost $50 billion richer than he was before the election. Tesla added more than $340 billion in market value in the week ending Monday, eclipsing a $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time since April 2022 in the process. Yu outlined several near-term factors behind the surge, including “retail exuberance” and short trade unwinding “due to lack of near-term negative catalysts.” But Yu wrote there are “potential large” benefits for Tesla under a Trump regime with Musk a close advisor, including “streamlining” regulatory approval of Tesla’s self-driving cars and the potential for Tesla to secure further market share in the U.S. with the potential cutback of federal tax credits for electric vehicles. Tesla stock led a broader rally for U.S. equities since the election, with the S&P up 4% over the last week, trading above 6,000 for the first time ever as Wall Street celebrated the positive earnings impact of the lower corporate tax rates backed by Trump.

Title: Kiwi retail crime intelligence firm Auror raises $82 million from Taser maker, grocery giants

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Auror, an Auckland-based maker of crime reporting and prevention software, has raised $82 million in a Series C venture capital (VC) round – one of the largest for a Kiwi firm - at a valuation north of $500m. If, say, a group of three people shoplift items from a supermarket then run out the door, the store can use Auror templates to quickly file a report with head office and police, including the likes of a snippet of CCTV footage, stills from facial or number plate recognition systems, and witness statements. Auror co-founder and CEO Phil Thomson says it can save a retailer like Woolworths or Z Energy one to two hours in filing time, and police one to seven hours per incident. A study by Sense Partners found in the 12 months to June 2023, police realised $92m and 170,000 hours of savings through workforce efficiency gains by investigating crime and requesting information more efficiently via Auror – a sum that, on paper at least, would fund another 450 police officers. Where’s the prevention element if our supermarket offenders simply legged it? “A lot of retail crime is very well-organised,” Thomson says. Around 10% of offenders are responsible for 60% of losses. Auror’s information helps retailers and police establish who the offenders are, and their patterns of offending – important as many gangs aim to execute multiple heists in a day, whether that’s dramatic ram raids or quieter shoplifting. “Proceeds go to guns, drugs and gangs,” he says. The funds will bankroll a further push into the US, co-founder and chief executive Phil Thomson says. More artificial intelligence tools will also be added, though Thomson. “We focus on responsible AI. It can make a workflow 10 times faster, but we want to keep a human in the loop.” An Auror AI might be able to make connections between crimes that elude an investigator sifting through millions of lines of spreadsheet entries, he says. The raise was led by two new investors, Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, plus returning Sydney VC fund Reinventure, which includes Westpac as its largest limited partner. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$46 billion ($77b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. W23 is a venture fund backed by five grocery retailers: Tesco (UK, Ireland, Europe), Woolworths Group (Australia and New Zealand), Shoprite Group (Africa), Sobeys (Canada) and Ahold Delhaize (US, Europe and Indonesia). Auror already has a substantial beachhead in North America. “Walmart in the US is one of our flagship customers,” Thomson says. (All up, his firm works with some 45,000 retail stores worldwide.) Yet the US has a much more complicated landscape on the law enforcement side. Auror has a close relationship with law enforcement in New Zealand – smoothed by the fact we have a single police force. The US, by contrast, has some 18,000 agencies going down to the county level, Thomson says.

Thomson is mum on financials but says its revenue, of which 85% is earned offshore, grew by 150% between 2022 and 2024. He says the firm got profitable before its $30m Series B raise in 2021, led by local VC firm Movac. Other investors include Shasta Ventures, Global From Day One, the Crown-backed NZ Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP) via its Aspire fund and Sir Stephen Tindall’s ubiquitous K1W1. “We still have really high conviction in the company but given our funding model – that is, our investments and operating costs are paid entirely out of Aspire realisations – we decided to take the opportunity to take some money off the table during this round,” NZGCP chief investment officer James Pinner told the Herald. The tough venture capital market and economic slowdown notwithstanding, NZGCP is on something of a roll. It recently realised a $37m profit from its early investment in education software maker Kami. Pinner won’t give a dollar figure for Auror, but says “Auror has already delivered back to us well over 10 times the total capital we invested since 2014.” “Part of this round was about making room for those new investors and allowing some of those early shareholders to take some off the table,” Thomson says. “NZGCP’s first investment was back in 2014 and it’s been a really good return for them. They’re not taking out all of their stake. But it’s a mark of success that we’ve been able to generate that return for them, that they could get and invested back into new Kiwi companies.” “We also worked with our team to sell down some of the Esop [employee stock ownership programme], realising some of that financial security.” In July, Australia’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner started making ‘preliminary inquiries’ after Australian Federal Police said they had started using Auror’s platform without conducting a proper privacy review first. Auror says the OAIC dropped its probe last month. Thomson stresses his firm doesn’t operate any cameras. “We make reporting software,” he says. He pitches that privacy is part of the firm’s DNA. He didn’t work in software, retail or law enforcement before co-founding Auror in 2012. Rather, he worked as an associate at law firm Simpson Grierson, specialising in intellectual property and privacy. He argues a “secure, online evidence locker” used with Auror better protects privacy than the mix of written reports, documents and USB sticks used previously. And while automated number plate recognition has raised concerns about privacy abuse (notably when police used it to illegally track two suspects during Covid lockdowns), Thomson says when it’s paired with Auror’s platform, it has a positive social benefit. He says Auror customer Z Energy reduced its losses from drive-aways by 73% after introducing number plate recognition. Attendants no longer had to make a value judgment based on their perception of how a customer looked. The licence plate detection made it black and white. If a vehicle was a previous drive-away, they did not get pre-pay. “It removes bias.” Thomson adds that 20% of retail crime involves aggression or violence – which he says Auror can help to tamp down. “If you imagine who’s in those stores, it might be a 16-year-old on the checkout doing their first fulltime job or a 60-year-old who’s been doing it for 30 or 40 years. They’re the ones on the front line being impacted by this emotionally and physically.” The firm has 220 staff worldwide, including 80 hired over the past 12 months, Thomson says. Some 150 are based in Auckland, where research and development work takes place. Around 40 are in an office in Denver. The firm has also opened an office in London. While ambitions are global, the core R&D team - established in Morningside in 2012 - will stay local, Thomson says. “We’ve chosen to keep our R&D here. We believe in the New Zealand ecosystem,” Thomson says. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

LISBON, PORTUGAL - NOVEMBER 28: A Maritime Police Commando carries a Taser 7 gun during a ceremony ...

(Photo by Horacio Villalobos#Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON), best known for its products, including taser and body cams for the law enforcement agencies, surged nearly 30% on Friday, November 8, after the company posted a solid Q3 beat and raised its outlook. Axon reported revenue of $544 million and earnings of $1.45 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $527 million and $1.20 respectively. The company is benefiting from increased adoption for its products, amid continued innovation. Separately, after a big rise, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold Insulet (PODD) Stock? For example, Axon's Draft One uses generative AI to convert the audio from the body cam into a report narrative draft. Also, it can translate over 100 languages. Such offerings help improve the efficiency of the police force. Axon's Taser sales surged 36% y-o-y to $221.7 million in Q3, its Cloud & Services sales were also up 36%, while Sensors & Other revenue was up 18%. The company-wide sales were up 32%, driven by continued demand for Taser and body cams. Not only did Axon see strong sales growth, its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 400 bps y-o-y to 26.7% in Q3. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in a bottom line of $1.45, versus 1.05 in the prior-year quarter. This year has been spectacular for AXON stock, with returns of 133%, compared to 25% gains for the broader S&P500 index. Admirably, AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes from the new Trump presidency, could AXON see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think AXON is fully valued at levels of around $600. At its current levels, AXON stock is trading at 25x trailing revenues, versus the stock's average P/S ratio of 12x over the last five years. Now, some rise in the valuation multiple seems justified, given the strong sales and earnings growth. An increased adoption of its products bodes well for the stock in the long run, given that the company earns recurring revenues from sales of cartridges and services for its products. Then there is the Trump factor. Law enforcement agencies are expected to be well funded under the Trump administration. There is a possibility of increased spending on technologies and products to improve security. Axon recently acquired Dedrone to expand its security offerings, and it is expected to see an increased adoption going forward. That said, Axon's valuation multiple has now risen 2x compared to its historical average, making the stock look expensive, in our view. While AXON stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at what's happening with Delta stock.
