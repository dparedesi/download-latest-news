Learn more. by Tim Ferriss 1 comment Welcome to another wide-ranging “Random Show” episode I recorded with my close friend Kevin Rose (digg.com)!We cover Kevin’s sobriety journey and marking 100 days without alcohol, my results with the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, GLP-1 agonists, home defense and security, the future of Venture Capital, authenticating yourself online, AI, the cultural shift toward human-to-human connection, Roblox, and more. Please enjoy! Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Castbox, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Audible, or on your favorite podcast platform. Watch the conversation on YouTube. The transcript of this episode can be found here. Transcripts of all episodes can be found here. This episode is brought to you by Momentous high-quality creatine to sharpen the mind; David Protein Bars with 28g of protein, 150 calories, and 0g of sugar; and AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement. This episode is brought to you by AG1! I get asked all the time, “If you could use only one supplement, what would it be?” My answer is usually AG1, my all-in-one nutritional insurance. I recommended it in The 4-Hour Body in 2010 and did not get paid to do so. I do my best with nutrient-dense meals, of course, but AG1 further covers my bases with vitamins, minerals, and whole-food-sourced micronutrients that support gut health and the immune system. I have always admired AG1’s commitment to improving one product over many years, which is why I am excited about their latest upgrade: AG1 Next Gen. It’s the same—but improved—single-scoop, once-a-day product to support your mental clarity, immune health, and energy. Right now, you’ll get a 1-year supply of Vitamin D free with your first subscription purchase—a vital nutrient for a strong immune system and strong bones. Visit DrinkAG1.com/Tim to claim this special offer today and receive your 1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase! That’s up to a one-year supply of Vitamin D as added value when you try their delicious and comprehensive daily, foundational nutrition supplement that supports whole-body health. This episode is brought to you by David Protein Bars! I’m always on the hunt for protein sources that don’t require sacrifices in taste or nutrition. That’s why I love the protein bars from David. With David protein bars, you get the fewest calories for the most protein, ever. David has 28g of protein, 150 calories, and 0g of sugar. I was first introduced to David by my friend Peter Attia, MD, who is their Chief Science Officer. Many of you know of Peter, and he does his due diligence. And David tastes great. Their bars come in six delicious flavors, all worth trying, and I’ll often throw them in my bag for protein on the go. And now, listeners of The Tim Ferriss Show who buy four boxes get a fifth box for free. Try them for yourself at DavidProtein.com/Tim. This episode is brought to you by Momentous high-quality creatine and more! Momentous offers high-quality supplements and products across a broad spectrum of categories, and I’ve been testing their products for months now. I’ve been using their magnesium threonate, apigenin, and L-theanine daily, all of which have helped me improve the onset, quality, and duration of my sleep. I’ve also been using Momentous creatine, and while it certainly helps physical performance, including poundage or wattage in sports, I use it primarily for mental performance (short-term memory, etc.). In fact, a new pilot study in Alzheimer’s patients, found that supplementing can increase brain creatine levels by 11% in just 8 weeks and improve measures of memory, reasoning, and attention—domains that typically decline over time. Momentous’s products are third-party tested (Informed-Sport and/or NSF certified), so you can trust that what is on the label is in the bottle and nothing else. Use code TIM at checkout and enjoy 35% off your first subscription order or 14% off your first one-time purchase! And not to worry, my non-US friends, Momentous ships internationally and has you covered. Want to hear the last time KevKev and I did one of these Random Shows? Listen to our conversation here in which we discussed maintaining sobriety with a partner who still drinks, Taiwanese tea, finding magic in the ordinary, the ups and downs of accelerated TMS, the intersection of AI and life sciences, deepfaked side hustlers, when meditation retreats go right (and wrong), and much more.

Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool. Critical is fine, but if you're rude, we'll delete your stuff. Please do not put your URL in the comment text and please use your PERSONAL name or initials and not your business name, as the latter comes off like spam. Have fun and thanks for adding to the conversation! (Thanks to Brian Oberkirch for the inspiration.) Hey, I get this isn’t the ideal place to get in touch, but I had the impulse to talk about my faith here. I know you guys aren’t militant atheists or anything but I also know you’re not religious…. I’m sure the supplement stacks are going great and I’m honestly grateful for both of your exploration into how to be as healthy as you can be and sharing that with the world. Having said that I think you underestimate what truly believing that there’s an all powerful being that loves you unconditionally and an eternity after this life—can do for your health. I’m sure it has an incredible effect on my nervous system and by extension all my bodily systems. I know at least Tim has said he just can’t get there—but talk about a weight lifted off if you could. The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads and has been selected for “Best of Apple Podcasts” three times. Listen on Apple Podcasts Listen on Spotify Watch and Listen on YouTube New! COYOTE is an addictive card game of hilarity, high-fives, and havoc! Learn it in minutes, and each game lasts around 10 minutes.For ages 10 and up (though I’ve seen six-year olds play) and three or more players, think of it as group rock, paper, scissors with many surprise twists, including the ability to sabotage other players.
