Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers buy now, pay later fintech Sezzle, how Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie made his fortune, the latest jobs data and a conversation with actor Issa Rae. The next time you see higher prices at the grocery store, there could be an unexpected culprit: a bee shortage. In an unprecedented event, bees died off by the millions this winter, resulting in financial losses of more than $139 million, according to a new survey. The bee industry is in full panic as California’s almond season is set to begin, which requires most of the country’s 3 million honey bee colonies to pollinate the trees. And it’s not just almonds that will be affected: Bees are needed to pollinate fruits like blueberries, cherries, cranberries and apples. There’s no known cause for this recent colony collapse. “We’ve seen tough times in the bee business before, but this one seems to be a different flavor,” one beekeeper told Forbes. A worker at an aluminum profile production company in Binzhou, Shandong province, China in 2024. President Donald Trump plans to announce new tariffs Monday of 25% on all imports of steel and aluminum, and shares of steelmaker U.S. Steel and aluminum producer Alcoa surged in pre-market trading early Monday. Trump also said his promised “reciprocal tariffs” will be announced Tuesday, and reiterated that he still intends to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico after pausing the implementation of those taxes by 30 days last week. MORE: Trump said Japan’s Nippon Steel agreed to drop its nearly $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel Friday and will “heavily” invest in the company instead, after the yearlong merger deal faced bipartisan opposition. Facing bigger and better-funded competitors like Affirm and Klarna, Minneapolis-based buy-now, pay-later fintech Sezzle needed a new revenue source and strategy. CEO and cofounder Charlie Youakim found both by focusing on heavy users: chronic buy-now, pay-later addicts. Sezzle launched a $12.99-a-month subscription service aimed at these frequent fliers, with benefits like access to more retailers and flexibility in rescheduling payments. Billionaire Bill Ackman disclosed Friday his hedge fund made a major bet on ride-hailing giant Uber, helping boost shares of the San Francisco-based company to their highest level in months despite a rollercoaster week. Ackman’s assessment of Uber reflects a growing consensus that the long-time cash-burning business has actually grown to be one of the cheapest big stocks compared to its bottom line. In the first jobs report since Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in the weakest start to a year for overall job growth since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, other data points revealed a resilient labor market, and the unemployment rate last month was a better-than-expected 4%. Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S., Axon Enterprise and Flock Safety, are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for law enforcement: One police drone pilot in New Jersey told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. Just months after raising $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation, defense tech giant Anduril is in talks to raise another funding round that would value it at $28 billion, Forbes learned Friday. News of the talks comes amid a froth of investor interest in tech companies developing national security products to peddle to the Pentagon. President Donald Trump shocked world leaders last week with his proposal to transform Gaza from a “hellhole” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, but it’s not the first time Trump has floated luxury development as an urban revitalization tool. It was the late 1970s when Trump became intrigued by Atlantic City, but his casino and hotel empire there was swamped by debt, leading to bankruptcies by the early 1990s. Trump said Sunday night he has ordered the Treasury Secretary to stop minting new pennies, citing the cost of production for the coin, which has been higher than its face value for nearly two decades. It is unclear if the president will be able to act unilaterally to halt the coin’s production or if it would require legislation from Congress. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Jeffrey Lurie mortgaged his family fortune to buy the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in 1994. Now, after their decisive 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia is one of the NFL’s most valuable franchises and a two-time champion. As one of Hollywood’s busiest multi­hyphenates, Issa Rae has parlayed a film and television career into a jewelry collection, a haircare company, a Prosecco brand—just to name a few. Despite her budding empire, Rae, who portrayed Presi­dent Barbie in 2023’s Barbie, insists she doesn’t have a master plan. “It happened organically, and it happened because these were things that we were all already doing,” she says. President Donald Trump temporarily reinstated the “de minimis” loophole that allows packages from China valued at under $800 to be processed without customs duties or tariffs, but his new executive order signed Friday states the exemption will cease for good upon further review by the new U.S. commerce secretary. The change had prompted confusion among e-commerce retailers, shipping companies and Customs and Border Protection, leading the U.S. Postal Service to briefly suspend acceptance of packages from China. Echoing earlier statements, Trump has proposed ending a tax break used by private equity fund managers known as the carried-interest “loophole,” a move Barack Obama and Joe Biden also supported. Carried interest is the percentage of private equity investment profits that a fund manager or venture capitalist receives as compensation for their investment, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending the loophole could reduce the federal deficit by $13 billion through 2034. “Every time Marc [Lore] has a new company, it's more and more ambitious, and if he pulls it off, it’s just a bigger story," says Accel partner Sameer Gandhi, who has invested in several of Lore's companies. TOPLINE Serial entrepreneur Marc Lore has dabbled in everything from e-commerce to baseball cards, and Forbes estimates such ventures have now made him worth $2.8 billion. Lore spent six years at three banks before quitting to start a company—any company. He and two childhood friends came up with the Pit, an online trading card marketplace they sold in 2001 for $6 million. After becoming a new parent, Lore dropped out of Wharton to cofound Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010 for $500 million in cash, then reportedly shut down in 2017. Next was Jet.com, an e-commerce take on Costco that Walmart bought for $3.3 billion in 2016 and shuttered in 2020. Lore stayed on to run the retail giant’s online arm until 2021. Later that year, he teamed up with retired New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez on a deal to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx for about $1.5 billion—to be paid in four installments through 2024. The third installment ended up in arbitration, with a decision expected today. Lore’s latest gamble? Wonder, which bills itself as “a new kind of food hall.” He founded it in 2018 and took the reins as CEO after he left Walmart. The original idea was to purchase recipes and branding from trendy restaurants and celebrity chefs, cook meals in central kitchens, then deliver them in oven-equipped vans, though in early 2023, he swapped Wonder’s 450 vans for delivery-focused storefronts, losing $80 million in the process. It now has 35 locations and $470 million in revenue—a long way from Wonder’s dreamy predictions of $2 billion in sales this year and a $40 billion IPO in 2028. But given Lore’s track record, who would bet against him? WHY IT MATTERS “If you’re reading this from New York or New Jersey, chances are, you’ve seen an advertisement for Wonder,” says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu. “How does a serial tech entrepreneur known for building, scaling and selling big businesses realize that he wants to spend 100 hours a week changing the way we think about dinner? What makes Marc Lore believe he can succeed in an industry where so many—notably including Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick—have struggled to turn a profit? For any aspiring entrepreneur, there’s something to take away from Lore’s story.” MORE How Daily Border Crossings Helped Turn This Mexican American Into A Billionaire The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, provides free tax filing assistance to underserved communities.

Title: Axon Vs. Flock: Two Policing Tech Giants Just Had A Big Falling Out

(Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S. are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat with each claiming the other is at fault. Earlier this week, Rick Smith, the billionaire CEO and cofounder of $50 billion market cap police tech giant Axon Enterprise, emailed a letter to customers saying it was cutting ties with Flock Safety, a $4.5 billion-valued provider of AI-powered license plate reader tech, used across more than 40 states in the U.S. “Flock has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that creates barriers for customer integrations in attempts to create a digital silo and coerce customers to purchase additional Flock services over Axon’s,” Smith wrote in the email, which was obtained by Forbes. The note was in response to a blog post from Flock CEO and cofounder Garrett Langley, who claimed Axon’s decision to end the partnership was a “surprise decision.” But Smith was clear on his reasons. “Axon decided that being open and collaborative is ‘no longer in Axon’s best interests,’ and no additional reason was given to us.” He accused Flock of charging excessive fees for integrating with Axon’s technologies, in particular Fusus, software that combines surveillance feeds into one app and uses AI to alert cops if criminal activity is spotted. Smith claimed that Flock had recently “escalated” tensions between the two companies by refusing to allow any Flock feeds to go through to Fusus’ software, “in an effort to strong-arm customers to switch to its platform.” Smith signed off by saying that he felt “embarassed” that he’d recommended Flock to customers, apologizing “that the situation has deteriorated to this point.” He included Langley’s email address, in case customers wanted to speak with the Flock founder directly. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for police. Luis Figueiredo, a police drone pilot in New Jersey, told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. “They do this so that agencies are forced to go with their ecosystem and not be able to shop around for a better deal or solution,” he told Forbes. Flock Safety’s senior vice president of policy and communications Josh Thomas said the company wanted to partner with other police contractors, denying Smith’s “baseless accusations about Flock and our team.” “In fact, a contractual agreement with Axon was recently reciprocated in August of last year confirming that Axon and mutual customers would have free access to Flock’s APIs, until Axon ended that contract a couple of weeks ago,” Thomas added. In his article on Flock’s website over the weekend, Langley blamed Axon for the bust-up. “Axon decided that being open and collaborative is ‘no longer in Axon’s best interests,’ and no additional reason was given to us,” Langley wrote. He said that attempts to contact Axon executives for a more thorough explanation had not received a response. He confirmed that Axon will no longer support new “mutual” customers from July onwards. Smith didn’t address that in his message, but did say his company would do what it could to honor existing contracts for combined Axon and Flock tech. Langley said it would continue to send Flock data to Axon users. It’s a significant altercation, given the two companies’ recent history. Axon was an early investor in Flock, which has raised $680 million to date from VCs including Andreessen Horowitz and Bedrock. Flock has seen enormous success, scoring contracts in as many as 5,000 cities across America, from San Diego to Atlanta. Forbes reported last year on Flock’s aggressive sales strategies, which led to cameras being rolled out in contravention of various states’ Department of Transportation rules on acquiring the right safety permits. As Flock grew, the two companies expanded their partnership to ensure that Axon users could access Flock’s camera feeds with ease. For cops, that meant more surveillance data in one place. But more recently their early partnership has been evolving into rivalry. While Flock is the much younger of the two companies, its rapid rise and grand ambition to end all crime with technology, has put it in direct competition with Axon, which originally made its name selling Taser non-lethal weapons, but is now a $50 billion-valued provider of bodycams, digital evidence storage and a plethora of other police tech. For one, they’ve started competing head-to-head on drones. Last year, Flock acquired Aerodome, a little-known 17-month old startup, for $300 million, while Axon has chosen to promote devices from Skydio, a Silicon Valley-based provider founded by ex-Google engineers. Others in the market are already trying to capitalize on the fracas. A recently-retired county sheriff chief turned Motorola safety exec shared Langley’s post on LinkedIn, attaching the note, “For those of you that will be negatively impacted by this news, feel free to reach out for a Motorola solution.”
