January 21, 2026 07:20 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Non Lethal Self Defense Weapon System Market Report 2026" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The non-lethal self-defense weapon system market has seen robust growth, with projections indicating an increase from $3.98 billion in 2025 to $5.55 billion by 2030, driven by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%. This surge is attributed to heightened adoption by law enforcement, advancements in related technologies, and growing personal safety awareness amid rising urban crime rates. Key market contributors include major entities like RTX Corporation, Rheinmetall AG, and Axon Enterprise Inc. Recent years have seen a rise in demand for non-lethal weapons due to regulatory acceptance and preference for less-than-lethal solutions within global policing reforms. Innovation in non-lethal defense mechanisms such as tasers and acoustic deterrents is gaining traction, bolstered by a shift towards smart and connected devices featuring tracking and safety capabilities. Trends revealing a preference for compact, concealable personal defense items, alongside increased investments in non-lethal weapon adoption in public safety and private security sectors, are shaping the market landscape. Initiatives such as simulation-based self-defense training and expanded manufacturer-provided safety services reflect this dynamic growth trajectory. Increased awareness surrounding personal safety is driving market expansion. For instance, Gunner Gear highlighted significant U.S. market growth due to rising crime rates, positioning tools like stun guns as popular choices in personal protection. FBI data supports this demand, citing an increase in assault rates from 2.85 per 1,000 people in 2022 to 3.15 in 2023. Strategically, major companies are innovating with advanced products and partnerships. A notable development includes the launch of the Theoram Mark-1 by TRETA Tactical Solutions, featuring a lightweight pistol capable of firing chemical irritant rounds with significant range and safety advantages. In a strategic acquisition, the UAE-based EDGE Group took a 51% stake in Brazil's CONDOR Non-Lethal Technologies in May 2024. This move aims to enhance EDGE Group's global stance, expand its non-lethal portfolio, and boost manufacturing and export capabilities.

Title: Justice Thomas, Joined by Justice Gorsuch, Argue for Broader Scope of Constitutional Ban on Ex Post Facto Laws

Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent Criminal Justice Eugene Volokh | 1.20.2026 11:36 AM Brief excerpts from today's concurrence in Ellingburg v. U.S., though the whole opinion is worth a read: I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedent. I write separately to clarify the foundation of that precedent. This Court's 1798 decision in Calder v. Bull established that the Ex Post Facto Clauses forbid only those retroactive laws that impose "punishment" for a "crime." Over the 228 years since Calder, the Court has struggled to articulate what it means for a law to impose punishment for a crime, and thus to be subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses. The Court's more recent precedents have implemented Calder through two multifactor tests that turn largely on whether the legislature labels the law as criminal or civil. But in 1798, "punishment" for a "crime" would have been understood to refer to any coercive penalty for a public wrong. Many laws that are nominally civil today would therefore have been subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses under Calder. I would restore Calder's approach to the Ex Post Facto Clauses…. Calder's understanding secures Ex Post Facto Clause protection in a wide range of contexts involving nominally civil laws. Those contexts include civil proceedings seeking fines for public offenses. See, e.g., Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. (2016) (describing "civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day [the challenger] violated the Act"). They include enforcement proceedings brought by administrative agencies. See Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U. S. 175, 196 (2023) (Thomas, J., concurring) (describing the 20th-century rise of such proceedings). And they include municipal sanctions like speeding tickets. "If one were to commit a minor traffic offense at a time the offense was to be punished by a $25 fine, and the government were to then amend the statute and impose a fine of $1,000,000 dollars, it would be nonsensical to treat that fine as non-punitive simply because the offense was processed civilly." Brief for Professor Beth Colgan as Amicus Curiae. Because all of these offenses impose punishments for public wrongs, Calder would treat them all as subject to the Ex Post Facto Clauses.

The non-lethal weapons market is experiencing dynamic growth, with its valuation expected to rise from $8.89 billion in 2025 to $9.65 billion in 2026, maintaining a CAGR of 8.6%. This expansion is driven by increased adoption for riot control and law enforcement, alongside the deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and electric-shock devices. Acoustic and water cannon systems are also seeing rising demand for perimeter security and area denial applications. Looking ahead, the market is forecasted to grow substantially, reaching $12.88 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.5%. This growth is bolstered by investments in advanced non-lethal technologies that promise improved accuracy and safety. There's a rising demand for scalable force options in military operations, alongside developments in smart targeting features and compact device mobility. Innovations also include chemical-free alternatives and enhanced acoustic and light-based deterrents. Fueling this market surge is the increasing frequency of political disputes and civil unrest globally, which is elevating the demand for non-lethal weapons. For instance, from July 2023 to June 2024, there were over 165,273 incidents of political violence, marking a 15% increase. With approximately one in seven people affected by conflict worldwide, the need for effective non-lethal solutions is evident. Companies in this sector are innovating, developing products like non-lethal projectile guns. These tools offer self-defense and crowd management options that minimize lethal outcomes. In March 2023, Guard Dog Security launched the Fireball, a device capable of firing pepper, chalk, and rubber projectiles, emphasizing safety and affordability. In October 2023, Day & Zimmermann LLC acquired Combined Systems Inc., enhancing its portfolio with non-lethal weapon solutions. Major firms influencing the market include Armament Systems & Procedures Inc., FN Herstal S.A., Axon Enterprise Inc., and others, indicating a competitive landscape focused on technological advances and safety. Regionally, North America led the market in 2025, while Asia-Pacific is anticipated to be the fastest-growing region through 2030. However, global trade shifts and tariffs are impacting production costs and supply chains, particularly affecting electroshock devices and impact munitions. These challenges are prompting a shift towards domestic production and cost-efficient systems. A comprehensive market research report provides insights into global market size, trends, competitor analysis, and strategic recommendations, helping stakeholders navigate the non-lethal weapons industry landscape.
