(Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S. are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat with each claiming the other is at fault. Earlier this week, Rick Smith, the billionaire CEO and cofounder of $50 billion market cap police tech giant Axon Enterprise, emailed a letter to customers saying it was cutting ties with Flock Safety, a $4.5 billion-valued provider of AI-powered license plate reader tech, used across more than 40 states in the U.S. “Flock has demonstrated a pattern of behavior that creates barriers for customer integrations in attempts to create a digital silo and coerce customers to purchase additional Flock services over Axon’s,” Smith wrote in the email, which was obtained by Forbes. The note was in response to a blog post from Flock CEO and cofounder Garrett Langley, who claimed Axon’s decision to end the partnership was a “surprise decision.” But Smith was clear on his reasons. “Axon decided that being open and collaborative is ‘no longer in Axon’s best interests,’ and no additional reason was given to us.” He accused Flock of charging excessive fees for integrating with Axon’s technologies, in particular Fusus, software that combines surveillance feeds into one app and uses AI to alert cops if criminal activity is spotted. Smith claimed that Flock had recently “escalated” tensions between the two companies by refusing to allow any Flock feeds to go through to Fusus’ software, “in an effort to strong-arm customers to switch to its platform.” Smith signed off by saying that he felt “embarassed” that he’d recommended Flock to customers, apologizing “that the situation has deteriorated to this point.” He included Langley’s email address, in case customers wanted to speak with the Flock founder directly. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for police. Luis Figueiredo, a police drone pilot in New Jersey, told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. “They do this so that agencies are forced to go with their ecosystem and not be able to shop around for a better deal or solution,” he told Forbes. Flock Safety’s senior vice president of policy and communications Josh Thomas said the company wanted to partner with other police contractors, denying Smith’s “baseless accusations about Flock and our team.” “In fact, a contractual agreement with Axon was recently reciprocated in August of last year confirming that Axon and mutual customers would have free access to Flock’s APIs, until Axon ended that contract a couple of weeks ago,” Thomas added. In his article on Flock’s website over the weekend, Langley blamed Axon for the bust-up. “Axon decided that being open and collaborative is ‘no longer in Axon’s best interests,’ and no additional reason was given to us,” Langley wrote. He said that attempts to contact Axon executives for a more thorough explanation had not received a response. He confirmed that Axon will no longer support new “mutual” customers from July onwards. Smith didn’t address that in his message, but did say his company would do what it could to honor existing contracts for combined Axon and Flock tech. Langley said it would continue to send Flock data to Axon users. It’s a significant altercation, given the two companies’ recent history. Axon was an early investor in Flock, which has raised $680 million to date from VCs including Andreessen Horowitz and Bedrock. Flock has seen enormous success, scoring contracts in as many as 5,000 cities across America, from San Diego to Atlanta. Forbes reported last year on Flock’s aggressive sales strategies, which led to cameras being rolled out in contravention of various states’ Department of Transportation rules on acquiring the right safety permits. As Flock grew, the two companies expanded their partnership to ensure that Axon users could access Flock’s camera feeds with ease. For cops, that meant more surveillance data in one place. But more recently their early partnership has been evolving into rivalry. While Flock is the much younger of the two companies, its rapid rise and grand ambition to end all crime with technology, has put it in direct competition with Axon, which originally made its name selling Taser non-lethal weapons, but is now a $50 billion-valued provider of bodycams, digital evidence storage and a plethora of other police tech. For one, they’ve started competing head-to-head on drones. Last year, Flock acquired Aerodome, a little-known 17-month old startup, for $300 million, while Axon has chosen to promote devices from Skydio, a Silicon Valley-based provider founded by ex-Google engineers. Others in the market are already trying to capitalize on the fracas. A recently-retired county sheriff chief turned Motorola safety exec shared Langley’s post on LinkedIn, attaching the note, “For those of you that will be negatively impacted by this news, feel free to reach out for a Motorola solution.”

Members of a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee have scheduled a Feb. 11 hearing to consider ways to limit the administrative state’s ability to impose new regulations. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 imposing a freeze on new regulations. House Republicans, meanwhile, say they plan to support legislation that would place additional controls on government regulations. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith, entrepreneur Magatte Wade and Hoover Institution Research Fellow Dr. Patrick McLaughlin are scheduled to testify at the Feb. 11 hearing. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Joni Ernst Takes Another Crack At Evicting Bureaucrats From Washington) “The American people trust President Trump and Republicans to strengthen our country,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That starts with transparency into government bureaucracy and cutting unnecessary red tape to make sure the American economy can thrive.” The hearing, titled “Reining in the Administrative State: Regulatory and Administrative Law Reform,” will likely discuss HR 142, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida. The REINS Act addresses executive overreach and ensures that every new major rule with a cost of more than $100M to be approved by Congress. Republican administration or Democrat administration, burdensome regulations affect us all. It’s time to #MakeItREINS and pass H.R. 277. pic.twitter.com/3EYmcIK5Wg — Rep. Cammack Press Office (@RepKatCammack) June 6, 2023 “The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright made it clear that Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, make the law. But more must be done to check the unconstitutional overreach of the administrative state,” Republican Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust, told the DCNF. “Not only should we codify the Loper Bright decision, but we should ensure rules that exceed the agency’s statutory authority are narrowed or repealed. This hearing will give members an opportunity to make those determinations.” The legislation would require both houses of Congress to approve “major rules,” defined as regulations with an effect of $100 million or more each year, through a joint resolution that the president of the United States would have to sign or veto. Currently, under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a regulation during a certain window of time, but the disapproval is subject to a presidential veto. President Joe Biden vetoed a bipartisan disapproval of one regulation targeting trucks in June 2023. The Biden administration proposed new regulations in 2023 targeting stoves and other appliances using natural gas, citing a study that says that gas stoves account for 12.7% of asthma cases among children. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged: Death Of The American Voter”) The Biden administration blocked efforts to start mining for copper and nickel near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota in January 2023, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency made a determination on Jan. 31, 2023 that would block the mining of 1.4 billion tons of copper, gold, molybdenum, silver and rhenium in Alaska in order to protect salmon. The Biden administration — saying they needed to fight climate change — also pushed for the adoption of electric vehicles, including the imposition of fuel-efficiency regulations for light and medium vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.

It encompasses people, processes, policies, standards, and roles that ensure the effective use of information. Data quality is a foundational aspect of data governance, ensuring that data is reliable, accurate, and fit for purpose. High-quality data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely, which is essential for informed decision-making. Additionally, well-defined policies and procedures play a crucial role in data governance. They provide clear guidelines for data management, ensuring that data is handled properly and complies with relevant regulations. Data Governance Pillars Data quality is the extent to which data meets a company's standards for accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency. It is a crucial element of data management, ensuring that the information used for analysis, reporting, and decision-making is reliable and trustworthy. Data quality is crucial for several key reasons, and below are some of them: High-quality data supports more accurate and informed decision-making. Clean and reliable data helps streamline processes and reduce errors. Quality data leads to better products and services, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. Poor data quality can result in significant financial losses. Adhering to data quality standards is essential for meeting regulatory requirements. The essential dimensions of data quality are described as follows: The following steps will assist in implementing data quality in the organization. By prioritizing data quality, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive innovation. Data policies are the rules and guidelines that ensure how data is managed and used across the organization. They align with legal and regulatory requirements such as CCPA and GDPR and serve as the foundation for safeguarding data throughout its life cycle. Below are examples of key policies, including those specific to compliance frameworks like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Define rules to check the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data during extraction and transformation. Require adherence to data standards such as format, naming conventions, and mandatory fields. Mandate profiling and quality checks on source systems before data extraction to minimize errors. Define protocols for detecting, logging, and addressing data quality issues during ETL processes. Define role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict who can view or modify data during extraction and transformation processes. Require logging of all extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) activities to monitor and detect unauthorized changes. Mandate encryption for data in transit and during transformation to protect sensitive information. Define policies to ensure only necessary data is extracted and used for specific purposes, aligning with GDPR principles. Establish periodic profiling of data at rest to assess and maintain its quality. Define specific metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, completeness percentage, duplication rate) that data at rest must meet. For data in motion, implement policies requiring real-time validation of data against predefined quality thresholds. Define levels of sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential, Restricted) and the required protections for each category. Ensure periodic backups and the use of secure storage locations with restricted access. Establish secure processes for generating, distributing, and storing encryption keys. Align with GDPR Article 5(1)(d), which requires that personal data be accurate and up-to-date. Define periodic reviews and mechanisms to correct inaccuracies. Under CCPA, ensure that data provided to consumers upon request is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Require quality validation of data before deletion or anonymization to ensure compliance. Define procedures to allow users to access, correct, or delete their data upon request. Require vendors to comply with CCPA and GDPR standards when handling organizational data. Align with legal requirements to retain data only as long as necessary and securely delete it after the retention period. Key aspects of data policies include: Clear and enforceable policies provide the foundation for accountability and help mitigate risks associated with data breaches or misuse. Procedures bring policies to life, and they are step-by-step instructions. They provide detailed instructions to ensure policies are effectively implemented and followed. Below are expanded examples of procedures for protecting data during extraction, transformation, storage, and transit, as well as for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data: Implement checklists to validate extracted data against quality metrics (e.g., no missing values, correct formats). Compare transformed data with expected outputs to identify errors. Automated tools are used to detect and correct quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, during transformation. Perform unit and system tests on ETL workflows to ensure data quality is maintained. Regularly review ETL logs and audit trails to detect anomalies or unauthorized activities. Use checksum or hash validation to ensure data integrity during extraction and transformation. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing ETL tools and systems. Create dashboards to visualize quality metrics for data at rest and in motion. Set alerts for anomalies such as sudden spikes in missing or duplicate records. Integrate validation rules into data streams to catch errors immediately during transmission. Schedule regular audits to evaluate and improve the quality of data stored in systems. Schedule periodic rotation of encryption keys to reduce the risk of compromise. Standardize the use of SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for moving files and ensure APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Separate sensitive data from non-sensitive data in storage systems to enhance security. Before responding to consumer requests under CCPA or GDPR, validate the quality of the data to ensure it is accurate and complete. Implement error-handling procedures to address any discrepancies in consumer data. Establish workflows for correcting inaccurate data identified during regular reviews or consumer requests. Before data is deleted or retained for compliance, quality checks are performed to confirm its integrity and relevance. Establish a ticketing system for processing data subject requests and verifying user identity before fulfilling the request. Define steps to notify regulators and affected individuals within the time frame mandated by GDPR (72 hours) and CCPA. Apply masking or tokenization techniques to de-identify personal data used in analytics. The following are the various generalized roles and their responsibilities in defining policies and procedures, which may vary depending on the size and policies of the organization. Data Governance Policy Makers A strategic decision-making body comprising senior executives and stakeholders from across the organization. Oversees the entire data governance initiative and ensures policies align with the organization’s strategic goals. Operationally manages the implementation of data governance policies and procedures. Serve as subject matter experts for specific datasets, ensuring data quality, compliance, and governance. Typically, business leaders or domain experts are responsible for specific datasets within their area of expertise. Ensure policies meet regulatory and contractual obligations. Provide technical expertise to secure and implement policies at a systems level. Act as end users of the data governance framework. Policies and procedures are periodically reviewed to accommodate evolving regulations, technologies, and business needs. By involving the right stakeholders and clearly defining roles and responsibilities, organizations can ensure their data governance policies and procedures are robust, enforceable, and adaptable to changing requirements.
