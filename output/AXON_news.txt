Members of a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee have scheduled a Feb. 11 hearing to consider ways to limit the administrative state’s ability to impose new regulations. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Jan. 20 imposing a freeze on new regulations. House Republicans, meanwhile, say they plan to support legislation that would place additional controls on government regulations. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith, entrepreneur Magatte Wade and Hoover Institution Research Fellow Dr. Patrick McLaughlin are scheduled to testify at the Feb. 11 hearing. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Joni Ernst Takes Another Crack At Evicting Bureaucrats From Washington) “The American people trust President Trump and Republicans to strengthen our country,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That starts with transparency into government bureaucracy and cutting unnecessary red tape to make sure the American economy can thrive.” The hearing, titled “Reining in the Administrative State: Regulatory and Administrative Law Reform,” will likely discuss HR 142, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, introduced by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida. The REINS Act addresses executive overreach and ensures that every new major rule with a cost of more than $100M to be approved by Congress. Republican administration or Democrat administration, burdensome regulations affect us all. It’s time to #MakeItREINS and pass H.R. 277. pic.twitter.com/3EYmcIK5Wg — Rep. Cammack Press Office (@RepKatCammack) June 6, 2023 “The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright made it clear that Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, make the law. But more must be done to check the unconstitutional overreach of the administrative state,” Republican Rep. Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust, told the DCNF. “Not only should we codify the Loper Bright decision, but we should ensure rules that exceed the agency’s statutory authority are narrowed or repealed. This hearing will give members an opportunity to make those determinations.” The legislation would require both houses of Congress to approve “major rules,” defined as regulations with an effect of $100 million or more each year, through a joint resolution that the president of the United States would have to sign or veto. Currently, under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a regulation during a certain window of time, but the disapproval is subject to a presidential veto. President Joe Biden vetoed a bipartisan disapproval of one regulation targeting trucks in June 2023. The Biden administration proposed new regulations in 2023 targeting stoves and other appliances using natural gas, citing a study that says that gas stoves account for 12.7% of asthma cases among children. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged: Death Of The American Voter”) The Biden administration blocked efforts to start mining for copper and nickel near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota in January 2023, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency made a determination on Jan. 31, 2023 that would block the mining of 1.4 billion tons of copper, gold, molybdenum, silver and rhenium in Alaska in order to protect salmon. The Biden administration — saying they needed to fight climate change — also pushed for the adoption of electric vehicles, including the imposition of fuel-efficiency regulations for light and medium vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.

It encompasses people, processes, policies, standards, and roles that ensure the effective use of information. Data quality is a foundational aspect of data governance, ensuring that data is reliable, accurate, and fit for purpose. High-quality data is accurate, complete, consistent, and timely, which is essential for informed decision-making. Additionally, well-defined policies and procedures play a crucial role in data governance. They provide clear guidelines for data management, ensuring that data is handled properly and complies with relevant regulations. Data Governance Pillars Data quality is the extent to which data meets a company's standards for accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency. It is a crucial element of data management, ensuring that the information used for analysis, reporting, and decision-making is reliable and trustworthy. Data quality is crucial for several key reasons, and below are some of them: High-quality data supports more accurate and informed decision-making. Clean and reliable data helps streamline processes and reduce errors. Quality data leads to better products and services, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction. Poor data quality can result in significant financial losses. Adhering to data quality standards is essential for meeting regulatory requirements. The essential dimensions of data quality are described as follows: The following steps will assist in implementing data quality in the organization. By prioritizing data quality, organizations can unlock the full potential of their data assets and drive innovation. Data policies are the rules and guidelines that ensure how data is managed and used across the organization. They align with legal and regulatory requirements such as CCPA and GDPR and serve as the foundation for safeguarding data throughout its life cycle. Below are examples of key policies, including those specific to compliance frameworks like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Define rules to check the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data during extraction and transformation. Require adherence to data standards such as format, naming conventions, and mandatory fields. Mandate profiling and quality checks on source systems before data extraction to minimize errors. Define protocols for detecting, logging, and addressing data quality issues during ETL processes. Define role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict who can view or modify data during extraction and transformation processes. Require logging of all extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) activities to monitor and detect unauthorized changes. Mandate encryption for data in transit and during transformation to protect sensitive information. Define policies to ensure only necessary data is extracted and used for specific purposes, aligning with GDPR principles. Establish periodic profiling of data at rest to assess and maintain its quality. Define specific metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, completeness percentage, duplication rate) that data at rest must meet. For data in motion, implement policies requiring real-time validation of data against predefined quality thresholds. Define levels of sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential, Restricted) and the required protections for each category. Ensure periodic backups and the use of secure storage locations with restricted access. Establish secure processes for generating, distributing, and storing encryption keys. Align with GDPR Article 5(1)(d), which requires that personal data be accurate and up-to-date. Define periodic reviews and mechanisms to correct inaccuracies. Under CCPA, ensure that data provided to consumers upon request is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Require quality validation of data before deletion or anonymization to ensure compliance. Define procedures to allow users to access, correct, or delete their data upon request. Require vendors to comply with CCPA and GDPR standards when handling organizational data. Align with legal requirements to retain data only as long as necessary and securely delete it after the retention period. Key aspects of data policies include: Clear and enforceable policies provide the foundation for accountability and help mitigate risks associated with data breaches or misuse. Procedures bring policies to life, and they are step-by-step instructions. They provide detailed instructions to ensure policies are effectively implemented and followed. Below are expanded examples of procedures for protecting data during extraction, transformation, storage, and transit, as well as for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data: Implement checklists to validate extracted data against quality metrics (e.g., no missing values, correct formats). Compare transformed data with expected outputs to identify errors. Automated tools are used to detect and correct quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, during transformation. Perform unit and system tests on ETL workflows to ensure data quality is maintained. Regularly review ETL logs and audit trails to detect anomalies or unauthorized activities. Use checksum or hash validation to ensure data integrity during extraction and transformation. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing ETL tools and systems. Create dashboards to visualize quality metrics for data at rest and in motion. Set alerts for anomalies such as sudden spikes in missing or duplicate records. Integrate validation rules into data streams to catch errors immediately during transmission. Schedule regular audits to evaluate and improve the quality of data stored in systems. Schedule periodic rotation of encryption keys to reduce the risk of compromise. Standardize the use of SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for moving files and ensure APIs use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Separate sensitive data from non-sensitive data in storage systems to enhance security. Before responding to consumer requests under CCPA or GDPR, validate the quality of the data to ensure it is accurate and complete. Implement error-handling procedures to address any discrepancies in consumer data. Establish workflows for correcting inaccurate data identified during regular reviews or consumer requests. Before data is deleted or retained for compliance, quality checks are performed to confirm its integrity and relevance. Establish a ticketing system for processing data subject requests and verifying user identity before fulfilling the request. Define steps to notify regulators and affected individuals within the time frame mandated by GDPR (72 hours) and CCPA. Apply masking or tokenization techniques to de-identify personal data used in analytics. The following are the various generalized roles and their responsibilities in defining policies and procedures, which may vary depending on the size and policies of the organization. Data Governance Policy Makers A strategic decision-making body comprising senior executives and stakeholders from across the organization. Oversees the entire data governance initiative and ensures policies align with the organization’s strategic goals. Operationally manages the implementation of data governance policies and procedures. Serve as subject matter experts for specific datasets, ensuring data quality, compliance, and governance. Typically, business leaders or domain experts are responsible for specific datasets within their area of expertise. Ensure policies meet regulatory and contractual obligations. Provide technical expertise to secure and implement policies at a systems level. Act as end users of the data governance framework. Policies and procedures are periodically reviewed to accommodate evolving regulations, technologies, and business needs. By involving the right stakeholders and clearly defining roles and responsibilities, organizations can ensure their data governance policies and procedures are robust, enforceable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

Title: Former Barstool Sports CEO Erika Ayers Badan Debuts ‘Work’ Weekly Podcast: ‘I Love to Work, and I Love to Think About Work’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/erika-ayers-badan-work-podcast-barstool-sports-1236291406/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T14:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Erika Ayers Badan will share lessons from her seven-plus-year tenure as CEO of Barstool Sports — which she’s affectionately called a “pirate ship” — and other insights gleaned from her career in a new podcast series. Titled simply “Work,” Ayers Badan’s podcast premieres Monday, Feb. 3, with new episodes releasing weekly on Mondays. It’s available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Amazon Music (via this link). Indie podcast network Lemonada Media is handling distribution and ad sales for the show. Fair warning: “I’m gonna use the word ‘work’ a thousand times in this thing, because I love to work, and I love to think about work, and be at work and help people at work, and talk about work,” Ayers Badan says in the show’s trailer (listen below). She will talk through topics like “what to do when your coworkers are idiots, what happens when you hate your boss and what do you do when you’re stuck in a rut.” Related Stories VIP+ BioWare Layoffs Deal Blow to Video Game Industry Stabilizing Before GDC 'Lurker' Review: A Geek Edges Himself Into a Pop Star's Inner Circle in Alex Russell's Nifty and Unnerving Parable of the Pathology of Fame “Work” also will cover a variety of topics including current events — like major corporations ending DEI programs, companies ordering workers back to the office five days per week, and “revenge quitting” — plus real-world work challenges she has struggled with in the past as well as those she currently faces. Ayers Badan’s guests on the podcast will include Lindsey Metselaar, host of dating podcast “We Met at Acme,” and Benjamin Kraim, founder of cannabis media and lifestyle brand WeedFeed. Popular on Variety In addition, Ayers Badan will discuss the backstories of sundry corporate jargon, like “circle back,” “bandwidth” and “EBITDA” (which, for the record, stands for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization”). “This is an unfiltered, vulnerable look at work and what it takes to make it at work,” Ayers Badan says. “Work isn’t perfect and neither are people but they both can be great. This show looks at what’s happening in and around the topic of work and offers perspective, advice and knowledge to those seeking to do more or be more at work.” It’s not her first podcast rodeo: At Barstool, she hosted “Token CEO,” a series that provided an “inside look on what’s going on at Barstool HQ.” Ayers Badan left Barstool, the bro-focused media company, in January 2024. That came after Barstool founder Dave Portnoy bought the site back from casino and gambling operator Penn Entertainment for $1 (following Penn’s $550 million acquisition). Running Barstool under Penn’s ownership, Ayers Badan wrote in a memo to staff, “was a balancing act and kind of an exercise in futility — trying to generate bets at the same time as protecting a pirate ship while also subtly contorting it to be something more predictable, pacifiable and projectable to match with a casino company.” In April 2024, Ayers Badan was named CEO of Food52, a food-centered media and commerce company, after serving as a board member and adviser since 2019. “I have a brand-spanking-new job and what I wanted to do was to create a podcast for people who want to be better at work and want to make work a way to change and make their life great,” she says in the “Work” podcast trailer. She currently serves on the boards of the Premier Lacrosse League and public safety technology company Axon Enterprise (the maker of Taser weapons). Ayers Badan is the author of “Nobody Cares About Your Career: Why Failure Is Good, the Great Ones Play Hurt, and Other Hard Truths,” published in June 2024. Prior to Barstool, Ayers Badan held several senior roles at media and tech companies, including president of Bkstg, chief marketing officer of AOL, VP of Branding at Yahoo and senior director of MSN branded experiences at Microsoft. Lemonada Media is an independent podcast network founded in 2019 by Jessica Cordova Kramer and Stephanie Wittels Wachs. The company’s original shows include “Wiser Than Me With Julia Louis-Dreyfus”; “Fail Better With David Duchovny”; “Choice Words With Samantha Bee”; and “The Sarah Silverman Podcast.” It also recently announced Lemonada Books, a new imprint and co-development partnership with Gallery Books, a division of Simon & Schuster.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/02/3-high-yield-closed-end-funds-to-buy-tech-stocks-for-less/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T15:41:00Z
Full Content:
Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
