SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - In a significant development for public safety technology, the Campbell Police Department has been granted a waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone operations both during the day and at night. This waiver, a first of its kind to include nighttime flights, allows the department to utilize Dedrone by Axon's advanced DedroneBeyond technology without the need for visual observers. The Drone as a First Responder (DFR) program by the Campbell Police Department, which began in 2022, has been pivotal in improving emergency response by providing immediate aerial insights upon receiving 911 calls. The FAA's recent approval under part 91.113(b) enhances the program by permitting the use of DedroneBeyond's ground-based detect and avoid system, thus enabling round-the-clock drone operations. The DedroneBeyond system acts as a virtual visual observer, allowing remote pilots to manage drones from a control center and swiftly respond to incidents, reaching altitudes up to 400 feet. The AI-driven technology ensures safe operation by accurately detecting and avoiding manned aircraft without compromising the mission through false alarms. Chief Gary Berg of the Campbell Police Department emphasized the significance of this approval, stating that it would allow for quicker and more efficient emergency responses, ultimately bolstering both officer and public safety. Aaditya Devarakonda, CEO of Dedrone by Axon, echoed the sentiment, highlighting the transformative nature of the FAA's decision for law enforcement across the nation. The DFR program in Campbell incorporates technology from industry leaders such as Axon Air Remote powered by DroneSense and MatrixSpace, providing drone operators with a comprehensive view for airspace management and mission control. Axon, recognized as a global leader in public safety technologies, is set to exhibit its latest innovations, including DFR solutions, at the upcoming IACP Annual Conference in Boston. This news is based on a press release statement, which outlines the collaboration between Axon and the Campbell Police Department in advancing public safety through innovative technology.
