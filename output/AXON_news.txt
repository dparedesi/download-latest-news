The non-lethal self-defense weapon system market has seen robust growth, with projections indicating an increase from $3.98 billion in 2025 to $5.55 billion by 2030, driven by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%. This surge is attributed to heightened adoption by law enforcement, advancements in related technologies, and growing personal safety awareness amid rising urban crime rates. Key market contributors include major entities like RTX Corporation, Rheinmetall AG, and Axon Enterprise Inc. Recent years have seen a rise in demand for non-lethal weapons due to regulatory acceptance and preference for less-than-lethal solutions within global policing reforms. Innovation in non-lethal defense mechanisms such as tasers and acoustic deterrents is gaining traction, bolstered by a shift towards smart and connected devices featuring tracking and safety capabilities. Trends revealing a preference for compact, concealable personal defense items, alongside increased investments in non-lethal weapon adoption in public safety and private security sectors, are shaping the market landscape. Initiatives such as simulation-based self-defense training and expanded manufacturer-provided safety services reflect this dynamic growth trajectory. Increased awareness surrounding personal safety is driving market expansion. For instance, Gunner Gear highlighted significant U.S. market growth due to rising crime rates, positioning tools like stun guns as popular choices in personal protection. FBI data supports this demand, citing an increase in assault rates from 2.85 per 1,000 people in 2022 to 3.15 in 2023.
