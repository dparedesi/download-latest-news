In other recent news, Axon Enterprise has been making significant strides in its business, as highlighted by its record-breaking second quarter. Revenue for the period exceeded $500 million, with new business bookings surpassing $1 billion. This robust growth was driven primarily by new products, TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, and a shift in revenue mix, with software and services now accounting for 39% of total revenue. Baird, a financial services firm, has maintained its Outperform rating on Axon while raising the stock's price target from $360 to $400. This decision reflects the firm's confidence in Axon's continued expansion and innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence capabilities and drone technology.

The company's adjusted EBITDA reached $123 million, with a margin of 24.5% for the quarter. Despite these positive developments, Axon executives have expressed cautiousness regarding potential economic downturns.
