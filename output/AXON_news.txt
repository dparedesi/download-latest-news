U.S. equities fell at midday following a weak report on the services industry and concerns about new tariffs. The S&P 500, and Nasdaq dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. Gartner (IT) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when the research and advisory firm slashed its guidance on declining revenue at its largest research unit. Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) slumped after the drugmaker announced a Phase 2 trial of its experimental pain medicine missed a key goal, and that it would no longer continue its development. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers slid when President Donald Trump said in an interview he would be announcing new semiconductor tariffs soon. Axon Enterprise (AXON) shares took off when the Taser maker exceeded earnings and revenue estimates and boosted its outlook on strong demand for its security products. DuPont (DD) also raised its guidance as it lowered its estimate for how much tariffs would impact full-year earnings. In addition, the chemical and materials maker reported better-than-expected results, and shares gained. Software analytics firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR) beat profit and sales estimates and lifted its outlook as it benefited from artificial intelligence product demand and more government contracts. Oil futures slid. Gold prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the yen, but lost ground to the euro and pound. Major cryptocurrencies traded down. TradingView

Title: Storage innovation surges to keep pace with AI shift to inference
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/opinion/Storage-innovation-surges-to-keep-pace-with-AI-shift-to-inference
Time Published: 2025-08-04T11:32:00Z

We provide market insights, research and advisory, and technical validations for tech buyers. In the fast-paced, whack-a-mole world of AI infrastructure, innovation in one area has a habit of creating fresh challenges in another. As AI attention increasingly shifts to the "value" phase -- inference -- a new set of issues is emerging for those running AI workloads at large scale. Notably, these are driving a fascinating new wave of innovation in the storage and data ecosystem that will likely have implications as more regular enterprises get on board with advanced inferencing. It's already clear that the underlying data infrastructure plays a critical role when running AI at scale. Indeed, research from Enterprise Strategy Group, now part of Omdia, found that data management issues are a top-two challenge for organizations deploying AI workloads. But, as the emphasis of AI rapidly shifts to advanced reasoning and agentic inferencing, those challenges are set to grow, potentially significantly. In such advanced inferencing scenarios, there's a ton of focus on the specific challenges associated with growing context windows. Broadly, these windows refer to the amount of tokens an AI model can consider at one time when generating a response or prediction. Context windows are growing in terms of both scale and complexity as users become more proficient with AI reasoning tools and expectations grow. Not only are users asking more sophisticated questions, but they are doing so over extended time periods. Think about how you may have interacted with a generative AI tool and then perhaps returned with a follow-up question several minutes or even hours later. Did you expect the model to remember where you left off? Additionally, prompts can now handle data types beyond text, increasingly supporting content such as PDFs, code and even video. This is leading to an explosion in the number of tokens generated for each prompt. As an example, Llama 1 supported a context window of 2,048 tokens when Meta released it in 2023. By contrast, earlier this year, Meta released Llama 4, which has support for up to 10 million tokens -- a 5,000 times increase. The "10 million tokens" problem may be more of a theoretical limit than an actual problem that is felt today, but there is broad agreement that, regardless of the size of the environment, a wave of tokens is heading toward us. This tsunami will likely overwhelm today's infrastructure, so alternatives are required. The key-value (KV) cache is where the context window is built and stored and, as such, is a critical -- and highly compute-intensive -- step in the reasoning process for large language models (LLMs). It's where the contextual understanding of the input request is built; think of it as the short-term memory of the LLM. The challenges associated with storing hundreds of thousands or even millions of tokens mean that, in more demanding or sophisticated environments, the KV cache quickly fills up. In such a scenario, older data must be evicted to accommodate new requests. To regain context, older prompts must then be repeatedly recalculated. The "GPU tax" comes into play here. Rather than using expensive GPU cycles to create new insights, they must instead spend time recalculating data they have already created. That's an inefficient use of an expensive resource. The KV cache was originally designed to deliver high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is pinned to the local GPU server. Tools such as vLLM have emerged as popular and efficient ways to manage data here. However, HBM is the most expensive form of memory, and as token counts grow, so does the need for a larger KV cache. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to use additional memory resources. The next obvious step in the memory hierarchy is CPU memory -- DRAM. Here, frameworks such as LMCache enable KV cache offloading to local CPU memory. But, as context windows and their associated tokens grow exponentially, this is not necessarily enough either. To cost-effectively meet the performance needs of advanced AI inferencing in the future, GPUs will likely need a KV cache that taps a larger pool of high-performance storage, such as NVMe. This would help context windows to dramatically expand, enabling GPUs to focus more of their time serving new prompts, while simultaneously boosting overall efficiency. Managing KV cache data this way also potentially brings other benefits, managing data on a global, more intelligent basis that can serve a wider variety of purposes. Given the stakes, it's not surprising that multiple industry players are intently focused on addressing this challenge. Overall, the storage for AI space has seen strong development in recent years, as suppliers have worked to overcome a range of AI-related performance challenges. We've seen the emergence of AI-focused storage specialists, each with their own technical approaches based on advanced data management software architectures and utilizing advancements in fast remote direct memory access technologies and protocols. In addition, we're currently seeing a surge of activity around advanced inferencing specifically, including KV cache management. For example, earlier this year, Weka announced a capability it calls Augmented Memory Grid (AMG), which is due for general availability in the fall. This feature uses Weka's parallel file system software to create an external pool of shared NVMe storage, which is attached directly to GPU servers and persists as a high-performance token warehouse. It drives memory-like performance but at NVMe costs, Weka said. AMG can also run in conjunction with Weka's recently announced NeuralMesh Axon software, which implements its software stack entirely in the GPU server to take advantage of underused NVMe flash storage within the server itself. Indeed, Weka said customers will experience far greater value when running the two aspects together. Though the technical implementation differs, Vast Data's Undivided Attention (VUA) feature, also announced earlier this year, offers similar capabilities. It uses Vast's Disaggregated Shared Everything architecture, in the process creating what it terms an "infinite memory space for context data." Like Weka's AMG, VUA is optimized for vLLM frameworks. DDN is joining the party with the new Infinia object storage. It has a KV cache embedded directly within it; DDN recently detailed a test scenario it said delivers the fastest Time to First Token in the industry for advanced reasoning workloads. Notably, Nvidia is also focused on addressing these challenges. Nvidia's play here, announced earlier this year, is Dynamo, a low-latency distributed framework for scaling reasoning AI models. One of the several innovations within Dynamo, which supports existing frameworks such as vLLM, is KV Cache Manager. The feature enables the offloading of older or less frequently accessed KV cache blocks to more cost-effective memory and storage, such as CPU memory, local storage or external networked storage. Nvidia said this approach can support petabytes of KV cache data to be stored at a fraction of the cost of storing it in GPU memory. Exactly how this will play with the various offerings from storage vendors is still to be determined. To some degree, Nvidia is offering an alternative approach here. However, Vast, Weka and others said they are working with Nvidia to offer integration between their capabilities and Dynamo. The new Nvidia Inference Transfer Library (NIXL), a high throughput, low-latency point-to-point communication library, provides a consistent data movement API to move data rapidly and synchronously across different tiers of memory and storage. Optimized specifically for inference data movement, NIXL supports different types of memory, local SSDs and, crucially, networked storage from Nvidia storage partners. Storage vendors are already working to achieve integration with NIXL. Weka has open sourced a dedicated plugin for NIXL. Meanwhile, Vast recently shared details of a test scenario that integrated the Nvidia NIXL GPUDirect Storage (GDS) plugin with the Vast AI OS. The test, Vast said, drove a single H100 GPU at 35 GBps using GDS without saturating the Vast AI OS' available throughput. In other words, storage would not be a bottleneck when offloading LLM KV caches to the Vast platform. It's tempting to view such context window challenges as something that should only concern a small number of large-scale AI builders, hyperscalers, neoclouds/AI service providers, large research institutions and so on. Such an assumption may be dangerous. Although it's true that handling millions of tokens over thousands of GPUs is still the preserve of very few, more mainstream enterprises are starting to get their hands dirty with advanced reasoning and agentic AI. Such deployments may only amount to tens of GPUs, but the prompts will likely be just as sophisticated. So, the need to effectively marshal a large volume of tokens will be just as critical, perhaps even more so, given the resource constraints. Hence, any infrastructure leaders contemplating their organization's inference journey should keep a close eye on developments here. The range of options for customers continues to grow and will likely expand further over the coming months. Mainstream storage providers -- including Dell, such as with Project Lightning; NetApp; and Pure Storage with FlashBlade//EXA -- are all sharpening their AI wares, and AI storage specialists, such as Hammerspace, are increasingly targeting the broader enterprise opportunity. Ultimately, the inference-specific issues detailed here are but one aspect of a much broader set of memory-, storage- and data-related challenges that organizations will face as they scale their AI workloads. The real trick for infrastructure leaders will be to build an AI environment that can elegantly handle these issues alongside the myriad additional challenges they face. In this respect, the ongoing innovations from across the supplier ecosystem augur very well for the future.

Last week brought a string of blockbuster corporate reports. Those will continue in the days ahead, with big tech companies and well-known consumer names set to publish their quarterly financial updates. AI data analyst firm Palantir, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, and ride-hailing app Uber Technologies lead the tech names set to report. McDonald’s and Walt Disney are among the leading consumer companies on the calendar. Several noteworthy drugmakers are also scheduled to post earnings, including Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariffs are remaking the landscape of international trade, while factory orders could help show whether tariffs are helping spur a rise in domestic manufacturing so far. Trade weighed heavily on stocks to close out last week, with concerns about tariffs and the health of the job market pulling all three major indexes into the red after a generally strong July. Consumer credit data later in the week will provide insight into how much Americans are spending. Market watchers will also be following comments from Federal Reserve officials after last week’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Palantir Technologies’ (PLTR) scheduled earnings report on Monday kicks off the week for investors as the firm continues to trade near record highs, lifted by optimism about AI spending trends. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is to report the following day, with analysts saying the chipmaker’s MI350 series chips could be competitive with Nvidia products. Analysts are also high on Uber Technologies (UBER) ahead of its scheduled report on Wednesday. McDonald’s (MCD) reportm on tap for Wednesday, is due as the burger chain has reported that traffic from middle-income households was down amid lagging consumer confidence. Disney’s (DIS) scheduled report on the same day follows the entertainment giant lifting its full-year profit outlook in the prior quarter amid subscriber growth in its streaming services. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) expected Wednesday report comes after the Danish drugmaker lowered its full-year outlook amid declining sales of its weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Eli Lilly’s (LLY) report set for Thursday follows cuts to its profit outlook in May against the backdrop of high research and development costs. U.S. trade deficit data, due Tuesday, will provide market watchers with more insight into how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are affecting international trade. The data comes as the gap between imports and exports is narrowing as the tariffs take hold. Areport on second-quarter productivity comes as market watchers look for the impact of AI on the workforce. Updated consumer credit data will be released as economists closely watch the health of the U.S. consumer. Meanwhile, investors will also be alert to weekly jobless claims on Thursday following last week’s employment report. After two members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted last week to cut interest rates, investors will be tracking public comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem for more insight into what's next for the central bank.
