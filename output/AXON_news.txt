We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gun Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) stands against other best gun stocks to buy in 2025. Please keep in mind that the category of "gun stocks" covers not only gun manufacturers, but also suppliers and retailers of gun parts, ammunitions, or adjacent products such as the ones used by law enforcement and public safety officers. America has a deep connection to guns, dating back to its earliest days. The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to bear arms. According to a Pew Research Center survey in 2023, about four in ten adults in the country say they live in a household with guns, while 32% personally use one.

While there is mixed opinion over the right to own a gun and the laws that regulate its use in modern times, most gun owners consider the weapon an integral part of their freedom. About 72% cite protection as the major reason behind owning a gun. Others own the weapon for varying reasons, including gun collection, hunting, sports shooting, and job purposes. While firearm purchases have been on a steady decline since the pandemic peak, the demand is still reasonably high. The United States is home to a thriving firearms industry that generates billions in revenue every year and provides employment to thousands of Americans. According to The Firearm Industry Trade Association, the sector contributed $90 billion toward the national output in 2023. This was 371% higher than the levels in 2008. American companies that manufacture and sell firearms, ammunition, and hunting equipment had employed nearly 155,000 people, as of 2023. The market has also created thousands of jobs indirectly in the ancillary and supplier industries, resulting in over 384,000 jobs tied to the sector. Combined, these workers earn around $25.98 billion in wages. While final figures for gun sales in 2024 are yet to be known, the FBI’s database recorded 5.5 million guns being bought by Americans during the first four months of the year. This was a slight dip year-over-year from 2023. California, Florida, and Texas represented 22% of gun purchases between January and April. During his election campaign, Trump vowed to defend gun rights and oppose any firearm limits. After being elected President, the 78-year-old signed an executive order aimed at reversing Biden’s actions on the guns. On February 7, the U.S. president asked the Department of Justice to review regulations drafted by the previous administration to look for any ‘ongoing infringements’ of the Second Amendment. Gun stocks surged last year in July, following the assassination attempt on Trump. The demand for guns and ammunition often sees an uptick after a law and order incident, or when there is chatter about a change in laws that could limit their availability. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds for the third quarter of 2024 to identify gun, ammunition, or adjacent product companies. From there, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Since there are few pure-play gun and ammunition stocks, we have also included sports and outdoor recreation companies selling shooting products in our list. The best gun stocks to buy are ranked in ascending order by the hedge fund holders in each company. When two or more stocks were tied on the number of hedge fund holders, we outranked one over the other on market capitalization. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The stock has had a tremendous five-year run, during which its share price has grown by a whopping 656%, amid robust demand in its TASER segment and several tactical partnerships and acquisitions during this period. The company’s financial performance remains strong as well. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 7, Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) reported that it had delivered above 30% annual revenue growth for each of the three quarters in 2024, driven by surging demand for all its products and services.

Conestoga Capital Advisors stated the following regarding Axon in its Q4 2024 investor letter: Axon Enterprise, Inc.

In addition, AXON continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margins, which were above 25% in the third quarter. AXON was a leader in three of the four quarters in 2024. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 46 hedge funds held a stake in the company – a significant improvement from 36 at the end of the second quarter.

(NASDAQ:AXON) is the best gun stock to buy in 2025. Overall, AXON ranks 1st on our list of best gun stocks to buy in 2025.

Title: CEO testifies on federal agencies as lawmakers clash on Musk

Getty Images As business leaders testified on regulatory challenges and the need to rein in federal agency power, House Democrats criticized Elon Musk and the Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies. Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform and Antitrust, detailing the significant hurdles his company faced during a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation into a 2018 acquisition. Axon sued the FTC in federal district court, challenging the constitutionality of the agency's investigative and adjudicative process. In April 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Axon's favor, and the FTC dismissed its case. Axon develops law enforcement technology, including body-worn cameras. Smith said agencies like the FTC should not have the power to act as "prosecutor, judge and jury." "The unchecked power of the government led to serious consequences for my company, for my employees and deeply for me, personally," Smith said. "The agency wields unchecked powers in ways that can crush innovation, stifle economic growth and deny basic constitutional rights." The Trump administration has waged war against federal agencies and their authority, from freezing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to halting work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has cases against companies including Walmart, Capital One and JPMorgan Chase. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order in January launching the 10-to-1 initiative, meaning that for any new rule an agency proposes, it must eliminate 10 others. "It's no secret that regulatory burdens have reached an all-time high," Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Wis.), the subcommittee chair, said during Tuesday's hearing. "The number of rules that agencies create is overwhelming." However, Democrats on the committee spoke against tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's access to sensitive data held by federal agencies as he leads the federal agency overhaul through his leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the subcommittee ranking member, said Musk is usurping Congressional authority and that there is "no check and no balance from the Republican Congress." "As we speak, Elon Musk and his band of near-teenaged accomplices are systematically working their way through the executive branch, knocking down agency after agency, while undermining the rule of law and shredding the constitution along the way," he said. Axon spent years in a legal battle with the FTC, challenging the constitutionality of its processes, Smith said. Axon acquired what Smith described as a small, failing body camera competitor in May 2018 for $13 million. He said the company had been attempting to sell for 18 months, but other competitors declined to buy it. Smith said the acquisition resulted in a "disproportionate government response" and the FTC demanded that the company license its intellectual property to create a "clone competitor." During Axon's dealings with the FTC, Smith said he learned that during the past 20 years, the FTC had won 100% of its cases in its in-house forum. The FTC can use an internal process called an adjudicative proceeding with administrative law judges instead of going to federal court to resolve cases. "This is bigger than one company or one case," Smith said. "Every American, whether an individual or a small or large corporation, should have the right to a fair trial before an independent judge." Magatte Wade, an entrepreneur from Senegal in West Africa and a hearing witness, voiced concerns about overregulation in the U.S., something she said has negatively affected Senegal. Wade is known for speaking against overregulation in Africa. "Even in the U.S., it is difficult for a business person to be fully compliant with all the laws," she said. "In Senegal, I usually have to pay lawyers to make sure I'm compliant all the way. It costs a lot of money and a lot of time and makes me very noncompetitive." Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said Musk's access to agency data and potential business competitor information should be a higher priority for Congress than a hearing about regulatory reform. Raskin described Musk's attempts to halt work at agencies like CFPB as "scandalous." "That's what we should be having a hearing about, not some academic conversation about the administrative state," he said. Wade said Raskin's words concerned her. She said regulation is a significant topic that merits a Congressional hearing. "As an entrepreneur, my time is valuable," she said. "I came here because I thought we were going to talk about the regulatory state and why it matters. I'm deeply offended by what you said there." While regulations are essential in achieving policy objectives such as protecting public health and the environment, regulatory reform can "reduce unnecessary burdens on businesses and consumers," said Patrick McLaughlin, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a hearing witness. "When regulations pile up over time without systematic review, this regulatory accumulation has costly consequences," he said. "Compliance becomes more complex, businesses face mounting overhead costs and entrepreneurs struggle to navigate the maze of over 1 million regulatory restrictions that are currently on the books."

Title: Forbes Daily: New Steel Tariffs Are Trump’s Latest Trade Escalation

Today’s Forbes Daily newsletter covers buy now, pay later fintech Sezzle, how Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie made his fortune, the latest jobs data and a conversation with actor Issa Rae. The next time you see higher prices at the grocery store, there could be an unexpected culprit: a bee shortage. In an unprecedented event, bees died off by the millions this winter, resulting in financial losses of more than $139 million, according to a new survey. The bee industry is in full panic as California’s almond season is set to begin, which requires most of the country’s 3 million honey bee colonies to pollinate the trees. And it’s not just almonds that will be affected: Bees are needed to pollinate fruits like blueberries, cherries, cranberries and apples. There’s no known cause for this recent colony collapse. “We’ve seen tough times in the bee business before, but this one seems to be a different flavor,” one beekeeper told Forbes. A worker at an aluminum profile production company in Binzhou, Shandong province, China in 2024. President Donald Trump plans to announce new tariffs Monday of 25% on all imports of steel and aluminum, and shares of steelmaker U.S. Steel and aluminum producer Alcoa surged in pre-market trading early Monday. Trump also said his promised “reciprocal tariffs” will be announced Tuesday, and reiterated that he still intends to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico after pausing the implementation of those taxes by 30 days last week. MORE: Trump said Japan’s Nippon Steel agreed to drop its nearly $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel Friday and will “heavily” invest in the company instead, after the yearlong merger deal faced bipartisan opposition. Facing bigger and better-funded competitors like Affirm and Klarna, Minneapolis-based buy-now, pay-later fintech Sezzle needed a new revenue source and strategy. CEO and cofounder Charlie Youakim found both by focusing on heavy users: chronic buy-now, pay-later addicts. Sezzle launched a $12.99-a-month subscription service aimed at these frequent fliers, with benefits like access to more retailers and flexibility in rescheduling payments. Billionaire Bill Ackman disclosed Friday his hedge fund made a major bet on ride-hailing giant Uber, helping boost shares of the San Francisco-based company to their highest level in months despite a rollercoaster week. Ackman’s assessment of Uber reflects a growing consensus that the long-time cash-burning business has actually grown to be one of the cheapest big stocks compared to its bottom line. In the first jobs report since Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in the weakest start to a year for overall job growth since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, other data points revealed a resilient labor market, and the unemployment rate last month was a better-than-expected 4%. Two of the biggest police surveillance companies in the U.S., Axon Enterprise and Flock Safety, are ending a long-standing partnership, in what’s become a bitter, public spat. Cops are already fretting about what the bust-up could mean for law enforcement: One police drone pilot in New Jersey told Forbes that when companies like Axon and Flock don’t work together, it ends up costing cops more. Just months after raising $1.5 billion at a $14 billion valuation, defense tech giant Anduril is in talks to raise another funding round that would value it at $28 billion, Forbes learned Friday. News of the talks comes amid a froth of investor interest in tech companies developing national security products to peddle to the Pentagon. President Donald Trump shocked world leaders last week with his proposal to transform Gaza from a “hellhole” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, but it’s not the first time Trump has floated luxury development as an urban revitalization tool. It was the late 1970s when Trump became intrigued by Atlantic City, but his casino and hotel empire there was swamped by debt, leading to bankruptcies by the early 1990s. Trump said Sunday night he has ordered the Treasury Secretary to stop minting new pennies, citing the cost of production for the coin, which has been higher than its face value for nearly two decades. It is unclear if the president will be able to act unilaterally to halt the coin’s production or if it would require legislation from Congress. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome on February 9, 2025 in New Orleans. Jeffrey Lurie mortgaged his family fortune to buy the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in 1994. Now, after their decisive 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, Philadelphia is one of the NFL’s most valuable franchises and a two-time champion. As one of Hollywood’s busiest multi­hyphenates, Issa Rae has parlayed a film and television career into a jewelry collection, a haircare company, a Prosecco brand—just to name a few. Despite her budding empire, Rae, who portrayed Presi­dent Barbie in 2023’s Barbie, insists she doesn’t have a master plan. “It happened organically, and it happened because these were things that we were all already doing,” she says. President Donald Trump temporarily reinstated the “de minimis” loophole that allows packages from China valued at under $800 to be processed without customs duties or tariffs, but his new executive order signed Friday states the exemption will cease for good upon further review by the new U.S. commerce secretary. The change had prompted confusion among e-commerce retailers, shipping companies and Customs and Border Protection, leading the U.S. Postal Service to briefly suspend acceptance of packages from China. Echoing earlier statements, Trump has proposed ending a tax break used by private equity fund managers known as the carried-interest “loophole,” a move Barack Obama and Joe Biden also supported. Carried interest is the percentage of private equity investment profits that a fund manager or venture capitalist receives as compensation for their investment, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending the loophole could reduce the federal deficit by $13 billion through 2034. “Every time Marc [Lore] has a new company, it's more and more ambitious, and if he pulls it off, it’s just a bigger story," says Accel partner Sameer Gandhi, who has invested in several of Lore's companies. TOPLINE Serial entrepreneur Marc Lore has dabbled in everything from e-commerce to baseball cards, and Forbes estimates such ventures have now made him worth $2.8 billion. Lore spent six years at three banks before quitting to start a company—any company. He and two childhood friends came up with the Pit, an online trading card marketplace they sold in 2001 for $6 million. After becoming a new parent, Lore dropped out of Wharton to cofound Diapers.com, which Amazon bought in 2010 for $500 million in cash, then reportedly shut down in 2017. Next was Jet.com, an e-commerce take on Costco that Walmart bought for $3.3 billion in 2016 and shuttered in 2020. Lore stayed on to run the retail giant’s online arm until 2021. Later that year, he teamed up with retired New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez on a deal to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx for about $1.5 billion—to be paid in four installments through 2024. The third installment ended up in arbitration, with a decision expected today. Lore’s latest gamble? Wonder, which bills itself as “a new kind of food hall.” He founded it in 2018 and took the reins as CEO after he left Walmart. The original idea was to purchase recipes and branding from trendy restaurants and celebrity chefs, cook meals in central kitchens, then deliver them in oven-equipped vans, though in early 2023, he swapped Wonder’s 450 vans for delivery-focused storefronts, losing $80 million in the process. It now has 35 locations and $470 million in revenue—a long way from Wonder’s dreamy predictions of $2 billion in sales this year and a $40 billion IPO in 2028. But given Lore’s track record, who would bet against him? WHY IT MATTERS “If you’re reading this from New York or New Jersey, chances are, you’ve seen an advertisement for Wonder,” says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu. “How does a serial tech entrepreneur known for building, scaling and selling big businesses realize that he wants to spend 100 hours a week changing the way we think about dinner? What makes Marc Lore believe he can succeed in an industry where so many—notably including Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick—have struggled to turn a profit? For any aspiring entrepreneur, there’s something to take away from Lore’s story.” MORE How Daily Border Crossings Helped Turn This Mexican American Into A Billionaire The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, provides free tax filing assistance to underserved communities.
