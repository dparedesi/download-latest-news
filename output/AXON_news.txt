On December 13, the Nasdaq stock exchange, founded in 1971, which pioneered the concept of electronic trading and which hosts many of the world’s leading tech firms, announced that on December 23, MicroStrategy Inc., which is one of the companies listed on the exchange, would get added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is a stock market index launched in January 1985 that tracks the performance of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) non-financial firms listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is worth pointing out that Nasdaq-100 and QQQ are not the same — the former is an index while the latter is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). QQQ, which is officially known as the Invesco QQQ Trust, is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 index, providing investors with a way to get exposure to the firms in the Nasdaq-100 through a single investment product. Nasdaq also announced that two other firms would be joining MicroStrategy on Nasdaq-100: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXON). Although Nasdaq is best known for being the world’s premier exchange for tech firms, in reality it hosts firms from a diverse array of sectors. Another index launched at the same time as the Nasdaq-100 is the Nasdaq Financial-100 Index, which consists of the the 100 largest (by market cap) financial firms. The Nasdaq-100 is reconstituted annually in December, “timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,” with the changes becoming effective just before the market opens, usually some date in mid-to-late December. Getting added to the Nasdaq-100 is a huge badge of honor for tech firms, and it is very hard to imagine MicroStrategy ending up there if it not had been for co-founder (and currently executive chairman) Michael Saylor and his strong belief in and advocacy for Bitcoin since the firm’s struggling software business is reporting increasingly lower revenue and increasingly higher losses based on the most recent financial results. For Q3 2024, the firm recorded a revenue of $116.1 million and a net loss of $340 million. So, how come MicroStrategy has a market cap of nearly $98 billion? Well, that all comes down to the decision — announced in August 2020, to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is also when it disclosed that it had bought 21,454 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. Under Saylor’s leadership and guidance, the firm has bet its future on Bitcoin and continuously kept accumulating Bitcoin. As of December 9, the firm owned 423,650 bitcoins (which has a current value of around $43 billion, which has been acquired for a total cost of around $25.6 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 21,550 BTC for ~$2.1 billion at ~$98,783 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 43.2% QTD and 68.7% YTD. As of 12/8/2024, we hodl 423,650 $BTC acquired for ~$25.6 billion at ~$60,324 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/8r7bFqMFof This means that approximately 46.9% of MicroStrategy’s market capitalization is directly attributable to its Bitcoin holdings at the current price. This leaves about 53.1% of the market cap representing the company’s core business, other assets, and a premium for its Bitcoin strategy.

Title: Nasdaq announces MicroStrategy’s inclusion in Nasdaq-100, what’s next?

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article The Nasdaq-100 Index will welcome MicroStrategy, Palantir Technologies, and Axon Enterprise as new members before market open on December 23, as announced by Nasdaq during its annual reconstitution on Friday. The three companies will replace Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna in the annual reconstitution of the index, which comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. With a market value of $102 billion as of December 13, MicroStrategy is set to rank 40th on the Nasdaq-100. Entering the Nasdaq-100, MicroStrategy stands to attract approximately $2.1 billion from ETFs that directly track the index, which collectively manage around $451 billion in assets, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterated in a post following Nasdaq’s announcement. He added that the $2.1 billion buying estimate might be conservative as it excludes separately managed accounts, closed-end funds, and active strategies. This weighting equates to about $2.1b of buying via all the ETFs that track the index which have $451b collectively. We did not include SMAs or CITs or any active strategies so it could be a little more when all is said and done. @JSeyff — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 14, 2024 This influx of capital is projected to drive up MicroStrategy’s stock price and enhance its market visibility. Stocks typically see a rise in price following their inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. Bernstein analysts project MicroStrategy shares could reach $600 following its inclusion in the index, driven by the anticipated capital inflow from index-tracking investment funds. MicroStrategy has established itself as a major player in the Bitcoin market through its giant holdings. The company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 will likely accelerate its ambitious goal of accumulating $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. As MicroStrategy’s stock price rises due to increased demand, the company will have greater financial flexibility to continue its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Michael Saylor-led company currently holds approximately 423,650 Bitcoin, valued at around $42 billion. The company has consistently expressed its intent to further increase its Bitcoin holdings, even at higher prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment makes its stock a proxy for Bitcoin. This means that owning MicroStrategy shares provides investors with indirect exposure to the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin was up slightly following Nasdaq’s announcement. It’s now trading above $102,000 million, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

The Nasdaq 100 comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies in the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index. A stock's addition means that ETFs – including the highly popular Invesco QQQ Trust, which has $325 billion in assets – will become automatic buyers as well. Shares of the bitcoin proxy could be set to gain off the move. They're up more than sixfold this year, compared with bitcoin's nearly 140% gain in the same period. The change, which will become effective before the market open on Dec. 23, was announced Friday after the stock market close. MicroStrategy was widely telegraphed as a potential contender for membership by investors who were looking forward to the index's rebalancing this week. "This would lead to inclusion of MSTR in some of the largest ETFs such as QQQ (5th largest ETF) etc, leading to one-time fresh buying … and ongoing participation in future inflows," said Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note this week ahead of the reshuffle. Additionally, "the market will likely set its sight on S&P 500 inclusion for 2025," Chhugani said. "Currently, due to profitability of its software business, it may be challenging to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion." The Nasdaq changes the constitution of the Nasdaq 100 index annually. The companies selected for inclusion are based largely on market cap rankings on the last trading day of November, which was Nov. 29 this year. Stocks must also meet eligibility requirements around liquidity and the free float percentage of their shares. MicroStrategy originally sold enterprise software, but the firm has increasingly become a bitcoin holding company. It first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, with Michael Saylor as CEO at the time, and has been leaning into that strategy in the years since. MicroStrategy now issues convertible notes to leverage its purchases, and its stock's daily trading sometimes looks like a more volatile version of bitcoin. The company now has a market cap of roughly $90 billion despite having less than $500 million in revenue over its previous four quarters, according to FactSet. Saylor told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month that he sees the company's role as "securitizing bitcoin." "Primarily, our job is to bridge the traditional capital markets that want bonds, or they want fixed income, or they want equity, or they want options, and we plug that into the crypto economy. And we use bitcoin as the vehicle to do that," said Saylor, who is now the company's executive chairman. MicroStrategy began cranking up its purchases after the U.S. presidential election. The victory of pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump — specifically his promise to establish a national strategic bitcoin stockpile — has propelled bitcoin to new all-time highs, achieved in part by the company's purchases. MicroStrategy now owns 423,650 bitcoins. It bought 149,880 of them in four different purchases over the past month, beginning Nov. 11. As part of MicroStrategy's hot streak this year, activists have been pushing bitcoin investing as an agenda item in shareholder meetings at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings have also begun employing Saylor's bitcoin yield strategy. Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise will also be joining the Nasdaq 100 later this month. Illumina, Moderna and Super Micro Computer will be removed from the index. Last year, the Nasdaq 100 added six companies in its annual reconstitution, including DoorDash. Five of those six stocks rose the Monday after the announcement, with an average move of 1.21%. —With reporting by Jesse Pound. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Play Raises Questions About Nasdaq 100 Inclusion

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Inc. checks all the boxes for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a development that would trigger purchases of the shares by the $451 billion worth of exchange-traded funds around the world that directly track the benchmark. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters American Institute of Architects CEO Resigns Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Dream San Francisco, Paris Named Best Cities for Urban Transportation City Hall Is Hiring Yet market watchers are entertaining the possibility it gets snubbed in the index’s annual reshuffling on Friday for one simple reason: MicroStrategy has morphed into a levered bet on Bitcoin attached to a small software company that many say has no business being among the 100 most-important stocks on the Nasdaq. “The idea of an index is it’s supposed to really represent faithfully the body of stocks that are in the universe,” said TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza, who has a “buy” rating on MicroStrategy. “Any large company that makes up a material portion of the Nasdaq universe should be reflected as being in the index.” Shares of the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm co-founded by Saylor have mesmerized Wall Street this year by surging more than 500% as the company accelerates an unconventional plan to raise capital solely to purchase and hold more Bitcoin. It has announced multibillion-dollar acquisitions of the cryptocurrency every Monday over the past five weeks. With the token’s price reaching all-time highs recently, MicroStrategy now holds more than $40 billion worth of Bitcoin. But its underlying business had a net loss of $340 million in third quarter of this year. Still, the company’s $98 billion market capitalization, which would make it roughly the 40th biggest stock in the Nasdaq 100, is largely based on its Bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy, and this could factor into whether the stock is added to the Nasdaq 100. Nasdaq could use the small size of MicroStrategy’s operating business as a reason not to add the company to the index, Vitanza said. However, that would be counterintuitive since the company’s market capitalization is so large, he added. ‘Bitcoin Treasury Company’ MicroStrategy’s software business offers it a benefit when it comes to inclusion in the Nasdaq benchmark, as financial companies are ineligible for the Nasdaq 100. MicroStrategy has called itself a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” but since its revenue comes from its software business, it is classified as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark, making it fair game for the index. The ICB could choose to reclassify MicroStrategy as a financial stock during the next change in March, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, said that MicroStrategy is now more similar to a commodity or an ETF since it is “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin. He thinks it should be reclassified as a financial-company next year. “One hundred percent of the value of the company is Bitcoin because the rest of the company is potentially a negative,” Lebowitz said in an interview. “A large majority of the company is just purely its Bitcoin holdings and the financial machinations around it, so it is a financial company.” Nonetheless, should it be added to the index, it would “introduce the potential for very large amounts of passive inflows into MicroStrategy shares and could provide a boost to its stock,” said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who also has a “buy” recommendation on the stock. MicroStrategy aims to raise $42 billion in capital from equity and fixed income securities offerings over the next three years, and has already surpassed its 2025 goal for equity. An increase in its stock price from inclusion in the index would help the company issue stock at premium and support its overall strategy of purchasing more Bitcoin, Palmer said. The increase in trading of the shares should the company be added to the index might not make a big difference to its liquidity, but it would bring in new investors, TD’s Vitanza said. “If you think about the liquidity in the stock and the volume of shares that trade, it’s not all that much,” Vitanza said. “But it will be new pockets of capital, so I think that the people that are going to wind up owning the stock on the other end of the index are clearly different people that are buying stock in the at-the-market” price. Joining the broader US benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, would be a different story. The S&P 500 considers the profitability of new additions to its index, which could be a barrier for MicroStrategy, which has posted net losses for three of the past four quarters. “The fact that they are not a traditional operating company in the traditional sense of the way that we describe that, I think, has much more of a bearing on the S&P 500 than it does in the Nasdaq 100,” Vitanza said. The Nasdaq index has long differentiated itself from the S&P 500 by focusing on non-financial companies, and only those listed on Nasdaq. The exchange itself has launched its own digital-asset products, offering a software platform for crypto exchanges to go to market. Palantir Technologies Inc. and Axon Enterprise Inc. could also be added to the Nasdaq 100, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Changes to the index will take effect on Dec. 23.
