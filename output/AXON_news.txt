JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Safariland®, a brand of The Safariland Group, a leading global provider of safety products designed for the public safety, military, professional and outdoor markets and one of Cadre Holdings, Inc.’s (NYSE: CDRE) (“Cadre”) key brands, is excited to announce its enhanced collaboration with Axon Enterprise, Inc. (“Axon”) in developing the newest suite of holsters and accessories compatible for use with Axon Signal Sensor. This joint effort delivers purpose-built technology that supports public safety agencies by enabling hands-free activation of Axon body-worn and fleet cameras, helping to ensure critical moments are captured while allowing officers to focus on the task at hand. Signal Sensor, formerly known as Signal Sidearm, wirelessly alerts nearby Axon cameras to begin recording the moment a firearm is drawn from a compatible holster, for both real-time situational awareness and transparent post-incident documentation of Use of Force (UoF) incidents. Coming this year, 17 updated holsters from Safariland’s 6000 series will be released with dedicated integration for Signal Sensor, along with eight newly developed firearm fits for the recently introduced Ballast Duty Holster. Safariland will also introduce six non-firearm UoF pouches compatible with Signal Sensor allowing integration with equipment, such as Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray, batons and handcuffs. The Signal Sensor unit can also be installed on a range of existing in-market holsters using an adapter designed for backward compatibility. Safariland has worked closely with Axon to simplify the process of ensuring holster compatibility with Axon’s Signal Sensor technology. With a wide range of adaptable holsters, agencies can seamlessly integrate Signal Sensor units either within the holster or mounted, using a bracket. Whether an agency is already equipped with Signal Sensor technology or planning future implementation, achieving compatibility is now easier than ever. “This collaboration sets a new standard for integrated duty gear technology and reflects our commitment to officer safety and innovation,” said Eric Gasvoda, Vice President and General Manager of Duty Gear for Safariland. “We are proud to partner with Axon in delivering a solution that enhances both situational awareness and accountability.” “Working with Safariland allows us to push the boundaries of what’s possible in connected public safety technology and expand holster coverage to protect more lives in more places,” said Craig Trudgeon, Senior Vice President of Product at Axon. “This collaboration enables us to broaden our coverage to include additional models in the future — delivering smarter, more seamless tools that empower officers and build trust within communities.” Safariland and Axon will announce the integrated holster collaboration in Phoenix during the 2025 Axon Week, April 22-25. Axon Week is a premier event focused on public safety technology and innovation.
