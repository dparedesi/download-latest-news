On Monday, BofA Securities made a significant adjustment to its valuation of AppLovin Corp (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:APP), raising the price target to $210 from the previous $120 while retaining a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment reflects a reassessment of the company's growth prospects following the second quarter 2023 introduction of its artificial intelligence engine, Axon 2.0. The firm's analyst believes that Axon 2.0 has sparked a transformation in AppLovin's growth and profitability that has not been fully appreciated by the market or other analysts. This underrecognition has led BofA Securities to reclassify AppLovin as a growth stock. The firm has increased its valuation to 18 times enterprise value (EV) on the calendar year 2026 (CY26) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from 14 times CY25 EBITDA. In addition to the revaluation, BofA Securities has also increased its estimates for the company's software topline growth for calendar years 2025 and 2026 by 600 basis points and 300 basis points, respectively. This revision is based on growing confidence in AppLovin's core business, particularly in mobile game advertisements. The firm's model for the Software Segment EBITDA now extends through calendar year 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%. The analyst highlighted that few stocks demonstrate approximately 90% incremental EBITDA margins, which justifies a significant change in valuation. Even with the raised target, BofA Securities' valuation of AppLovin remains conservative compared to the valuations of AppLovin's marketing technology peers such as The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), and Snap Inc . (NYSE:SNAP), which trade at 38 times, 37 times, and 18 times EBITDA, respectively. Notably, AppLovin's profitability surpasses that of these companies. BofA Securities' forecasts for AppLovin stand well above the consensus, and the firm claims to have the highest estimates on the street by a considerable margin. The analyst's outlook suggests a robust future for AppLovin, underpinned by solid fundamentals and a strong position within its industry. In other recent news, AppLovin Corp has seen a series of adjustments by financial analysts. Goldman Sachs downgraded AppLovin stock to neutral, setting a new price target of $147.00, following an upward revision of the company's Q3 revenue projections for 2024. Meanwhile, HSBC maintained a Buy rating for AppLovin, raising the stock target to $154.40, due to the company's growth momentum in the software platform sector and its expansion into online retail advertising. Macquarie also maintained its Outperform rating, increasing its price target to $150, recognizing AppLovin's significant growth and higher margins. Citi raised its price target for AppLovin to $155, maintaining a Buy rating, due to increased confidence in the company's potential for software revenue growth. On the other hand, UBS upgraded AppLovin's stock from Neutral to Buy, setting a new price target of $145, based on the company's improved visibility into medium-term revenue growth. BTIG maintained a Buy rating, raising its price target to $150, reflecting a positive view of the company's competitive position and future growth potential. Despite these positive assessments, Benchmark maintained a sell rating, raising its price target to $66, citing potential challenges. AppLovin's Q2 financial results showed strong performance, with a 44% increase in revenue to $1.08 billion. The company's future guidance predicts Q3 revenue between $1.115 billion and $1.135 billion, and adjusted EBITDA ranging from $630 million to $650 million. AppLovin's recent performance and future prospects align closely with BofA Securities' bullish outlook.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - In a significant development for public safety technology, the Campbell Police Department has been granted a waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone operations both during the day and at night. This waiver, a first of its kind to include nighttime flights, allows the department to utilize Dedrone by Axon's advanced DedroneBeyond technology without the need for visual observers. The Drone as a First Responder (DFR) program by the Campbell Police Department, which began in 2022, has been pivotal in improving emergency response by providing immediate aerial insights upon receiving 911 calls. The FAA's recent approval under part 91.113(b) enhances the program by permitting the use of DedroneBeyond's ground-based detect and avoid system, thus enabling round-the-clock drone operations. The DedroneBeyond system acts as a virtual visual observer, allowing remote pilots to manage drones from a control center and swiftly respond to incidents, reaching altitudes up to 400 feet. The AI-driven technology ensures safe operation by accurately detecting and avoiding manned aircraft without compromising the mission through false alarms. Chief Gary Berg of the Campbell Police Department emphasized the significance of this approval, stating that it would allow for quicker and more efficient emergency responses, ultimately bolstering both officer and public safety. Aaditya Devarakonda, CEO of Dedrone by Axon, echoed the sentiment, highlighting the transformative nature of the FAA's decision for law enforcement across the nation. The DFR program in Campbell incorporates technology from industry leaders such as Axon Air Remote powered by DroneSense and MatrixSpace, providing drone operators with a comprehensive view for airspace management and mission control.
