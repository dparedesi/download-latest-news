ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. Flock has tens of thousands of cameras operating across almost all American states. It's now giving those devices live streaming capability, making them significantly more powerful. Flock Safety, the $7.5 billion car surveillance company, has already built a sizable AI-powered camera network, with tens of thousands of smart license plate readers monitoring roads in 49 American states. Soon its cameras are going to capture a lot more. In the fall this year, cops will be able to turn their Flock license plate readers into something more akin to traditional surveillance cameras. While Flock cameras today take photos of vehicles, flagging any car that’s on a hotlist of suspected vehicles to cops or private industry customers like FedEx or mall provider Simon Property, those same customers will soon be able to request either live feeds or 15 second clips from around the time a vehicle passed through a camera’s field of vision. Garrett Langley, Flock CEO, told Forbes that the update should give cops more “situational awareness.” Police will be able to pull up feeds from Flock cameras when a 911 call comes in, for instance, Langley said. “We will just open up the five nearest cameras in real time and say, here's what's happening right now,” he said. There will also be the option to upgrade to a camera where the angle can be adjusted, for a wider purview. “If it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.” For years, civil liberties experts have worried about Flock’s expansion. Last week, 404 Media reported that a Texas agency had used it to locate a woman who’d had a self-administered abortion across state lines. Jay Stanley, technology director at the ACLU, fretted that Flock “is trying to build a nationwide authoritarian surveillance system.” Langley, in response to those privacy concerns, said that Flock’s tech was auditable and transparent. It was down to democratically-elected individuals and groups to decide if Flock was right for them and what they do with the data the cameras collect, he said. Flock’s expansion comes on the heels of Axon Enterprise announcing a rival product to Flock’s license plate readers in April. Flock and Axon, a $59 billion market cap publicly traded cop contractor best known for making the Taser, had previously been partners, but in February, the two companies had a very public break up. Axon CEO Rick Smith said at the time that Flock was trying to lock customers into its products by making its software restrictive enough that it didn’t work as effectively with other vendors’ tools. Langley in response claimed it was Axon that had decided to be less collaborative, as evidenced by its decision to stop working with or recommending Flock. Langley told Forbes in an interview last week that he was hoping to challenge Axon’s “monopoly” by building a competitor that the market had been lacking. He claimed agencies he spoke with had become “frustrated with the monopolistic behavior that Axon has exhibited over the years and continues to exhibit, and I think that the beauty of capitalism is that it enables competition when properly enforced.” In response, Axon spokesperson Alex Engel said that Axon was a collaborative business with over 60 technology partners and integrations, which “underscores our commitment to customer choice, interoperability, and transparency.” “Axon's ecosystem is built on the belief that customers should always own and control their data,” Engel added, without mentioning Flock. Flock has been broadening its product offering for police to include drones, gunshot detection and a new software suite called Nova, which draws in information from police databases to make connections between suspects, properties or any other notable aspect of an investigation. That latter tool was built on technology Flock Safety quietly acquired in a previously unreported deal with Lucidus Tech last year. Lucidus was cofounded by former senior staff at Peregrine Technologies, a $2.5 billion startup that offers similar tech to Nova. Langley said that cops can now take information they find from Flock license plate readers and feed it into Nova to ask, for instance, if a car owner has a criminal history or any mental health conditions. For Flock, which raised $275 million earlier this year in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, expansion also means far higher overheads. The latest update to add surveillance camera functionality could increase costs substantially when it comes to storing the video on its Amazon Web Services servers. “If it's heavily, heavily used, it will be quite expensive for us,” Langley said. “But we feel like if it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.”

Title: This CEO collected almost $165 million last year — more than the boss of Apple or Blackstone

The best-paid CEO last year was not running a technology giant or a Wall Street firm — but the company that makes Tasers. Rick Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Axon Enterprise, which makes stun guns used by many police forces, took home almost $165 million last year. Although Smith's annual salary was $31,201, he was awarded stock options worth just over $164 million after meeting a series of targets over several years. He told The Wall Street Journal that the stock award came from a scheme open to all Axon employees that lets them convert salary into stock options, whose value depends on the share price performance. "It creates that startup kind of vibe," said Smith, who has been CEO of Axon since 1993. Axon stock is up more than a fifth over the past month after posting strong first-quarter results. The price has soared more than 700% over the past five years, leaving the company worth almost $60 billion. Smith's compensation exceeded the total for better-known S&P 500 businesses such as Starbucks or Apple, per data compiled by public company intelligence platform MyLogIQ. Second on its list was new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who collected a $5 million bonus and stock awards worth about $90 million. Larry Culp, CEO of GE Aerospace, was third on $89 million, followed by Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman on $84 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook collected nearly $75 million last year, including a salary of $3 million and a stock award worth $58 million, putting him in fifth place. Other names on MyLogIQ's top 20 include KKR co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall ($73 million and $64 million respectively); Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters (almost $62 million and $60 million); and Salesforce's Marc Benioff on $55 million. A study by Equilar and The Associated Press found that in 2023, the pay of CEOs in the S&P 500 rose by 12.6% year-on-year. Axon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Update font size. Reset A new analysis from The Wall Street Journal revealed which CEOs heading up S&P 500 companies had the biggest pay packages in 2024. Apple CEO Tim Cook place 4th on the list. Aislinn Murphy for FOX Business: ‎ The Journal said its analysis looked at MyLogIQ data to rank a total of more than 400 CEOs who had been at the helm of S&P 500 companies for a year or longer. 1. Rick Smith – Axon Enterprises: Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s $164.53 million pay package was the only one of the S&P 500 companies last year in which the package was six figures, according to The Journal. Stock awards linked to company performance accounted for the bulk of his 2024 compensation. Axon, which makes Tasers and other products, had a market capitalization of over $58 billion as of Monday. 2. Lawrence Culp Jr. – GE Aerospace: Larry Culp is the CEO of GE Aerospace. The analysis pegged his 2024 compensation at $88.95 million, earning him the No. 2 spot. 3. Stephen Schwarzman – Blackstone: Blackstone compensated CEO Stephen Schwarzman about $84.03 million in 2024, The Journal reported. The private equity firm had nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management as of the end of March. He co-founded Blackstone in the 1980s along with Peter Peterson. 4. Tim Cook – Apple: Apple CEO Tim Cook’s $74.61 million pay package included cash, equity, and other compensation, according to the Journal. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Can’t see what’s coming except for fat checks and endless stock awards. $74.61 million. While Cook is hemming and hawing when faced with shareholders (virtually, of course, never again in person for as long as Cook remains), Apple is currently in scramble mode trying to catch up to rivals — including the world’s most valuable company, Microsoft — in generative AI, a technology the company seems to have completely missed while focusing instead on the not-ready-for-primetime Apple Vision Pro, visionOS, its now-canceled decade-long multi-billion-dollar electric vehicle boondoggle, replacing leather in iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands with overpriced junk in a quest to “save the planet,” forcing employees to endure a constant barrage of time-wasting zero-productivity DEI sessions, and myriad other various and sundry “initiatives” which Cook deems of import. – MacDailyNews, February 28, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.
