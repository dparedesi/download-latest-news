The moment Axon Enterprise announced a new product, Draft One, that would allow law enforcement officers to use artificial intelligence to automatically generate incident report narratives based on body-worn camera audio, everyone in the police accountability community immediately started asking the same questions. What do AI-generated police reports look like? What kind of paper trail does this system leave? How do we get a hold of documentation using public records laws? Unfortunately, obtaining these records isn't easy. In many cases, it's straight-up impossible. Read our full report on how Axon's Draft One defies transparency expectations by design here. In some jurisdictions, the documents are walled off behind government-created barriers. For example, California fully exempts police narrative reports from public disclosure, while other states charge fees to access individual reports that become astronomical if you want to analyze the output in bulk. Then there are technical barriers: Axon's product itself does not allow agencies to isolate reports that contain an AI-generated narrative, although an agency can voluntarily institute measures to make them searchable by a keyword. This spring, EFF tested out different public records request templates and sent them to dozens of law enforcement agencies we believed are using Draft One. We asked each agency for the Draft One-generated police reports themselves, knowing that in most cases this would be a long shot. We also dug into Axon's user manuals to figure out what kind of logs are generated and how to carefully phrase our public records request to get them. We asked for the current system settings for Draft One, since there are a lot of levers police administrators can pull that drastically change how and when officers can use the software. We also requested the standard records that we usually ask for when researching new technologies: procurement documents, agreements, training manuals, policies, and emails with vendors. Like all mass public records campaigns, the results were… mixed. Some agencies were refreshingly open with their records. Others assessed us records fees well outside the usual range for a non-profit organization. What we learned about the process is worth sharing. Axon has thousands of clients nationwide that use its Tasers, body-worn cameras and bundles of surveillance equipment, and the company is using those existing relationships to heavily promote Draft One. We expect many more cities to deploy the technology over the next few years. Watchdogging police use of AI will require a nationwide effort by journalists, advocacy organizations and community volunteers. Below we’re sharing some sample language you can use in your own public records requests about Draft One — but be warned. It’s likely that the more you include, the longer it might take and the higher the fees will get. The template language and our suggestions for filing public records requests are not legal advice. If you have specific questions about a public records request you filed, consult a lawyer. Language to try in your public records request: Or If you are curious about a particular officer's Draft One usage, you can also ask for their reports specifically. However it may be helpful to obtain their usage log first (see section 2). We suggest using weeks, not months, because the sheer number of reports can get costly very quickly. As an add-on to Axon's evidence and records management platforms, Draft One uses ChatGPT to convert audio taken from Axon body-worn cameras into the so-called first draft of the narrative portion of a police report. When Politico surveyed seven agencies in September 2024, reporter Alfred Ng found that police administrators did not have the technical ability to identify which reports contained AI-generated language. As Ng reported. “There is no way for us to search for these on our end,” a Lafayette, IN police captain told Ng. Six months later, EFF received the same no-can-do response from the Lafayette Police Department. Although Lafayette Police could not create a list on their own, it turns out that Axon's engineers can generate these reports for police if asked. When the Frederick Police Department in Colorado received a similar request from Ng, the agency contacted Axon for help. The company does internally track reports written with Draft One and was able to provide a spreadsheet of Draft One reports (.csv) and even provided Frederick Police with computer code to allow the agency to create similar lists in the future. Axon told them they would look at making this a feature in the future, but that appears not to have happened yet. But we also struck gold with two agencies: the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBCSO) in Florida and the Lake Havasu City Police Department in Arizona. In both cases, the agencies require officers to include a disclosure that they used Draft One at the end of the police narrative. Here's a slide from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Draft One training: And here's the boilerplate disclosure: I acknowledge this report was generated from a digital recording using Draft One by Axon. I further acknowledge that I have I reviewed the report, made any necessary edits, and believe it to be an accurate representation of my recollection of the reported events. I am willing to testify to the accuracy of this report. As small a gesture as it may seem, that disclosure makes all the difference when it comes to responding to a public records request. Lafayette Police could not isolate the reports because its policy does not require the disclosure. A Frederick Police Department sergeant noted in an email to Axon that they could isolate reports when the auto-disclosure was turned on, but not after they decided to turn it off. This year, Utah legislators introduced a bill to require this kind of disclosure on AI-generated reports. As the PBCSO records manager told us: "We are able to do a keyword and a timeframe search. I used the words ‘Draft One’ and the system generated all the Draft One reports for that timeframe." In fact, in Palm Beach County and Lake Havasu, records administrators dug up huge numbers of records. But, once we saw the estimated price tag, we ultimately narrowed our request to just 10 reports. Here is an example of a report from PBCSO, which only allows Draft One to be used in incidents that don't involve a criminal charge. As a result, many of the reports were related to mental health or domestic dispute responses. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. And here is an example from the Lake Havasu City Police Department, whose clerk was kind enough to provide us with a diverse sample of requests. A machine readable text version of this report is available here. Full version here. EFF redacted some of these records to protect the identity of members of the public who were captured on body-worn cameras. Black-bar redactions were made by the agencies, while bars with X's were made by us. You can view all the examples we received below: We also received police reports (perhaps unintentionally) from two other agencies that were contained as email attachments in response to another part of our request (see section 7). Language to try in your public records request: Note: You can save time by determining in advance whether the agency uses Axon Evidence or Axon Records and Standards, then choose the applicable option below. If you don't know, you can always request both. Audit logs from Axon Evidence Or Audit logs from Axon Records and Axon Standards You could also tell the agency you are only interested in Draft One related items, which may save the agency time in reviewing and redacting the documents. Generally, many of the basic actions a police officer takes using Axon technology — whether it's signing in, changing a password, accessing evidence or uploading BWC footage — is logged in the system. This also includes some actions when an officer uses Draft One. However, the system only logs three types of activities: requesting that Draft One generate a report, signing a Draft One liability disclosure, or changing Draft One's settings. And these reports are one of the only ways to identify which reports were written with AI and how widely the technology is used. Unfortunately, Axon appears to have designed its system so that administrators cannot create a list of all Draft One activities taken by the entire police force. Instead, all they can do is view an individual officer's audit log to see when they used Draft One or look at the log for a particular piece of evidence to see if Draft One was used. These can be exported as a spreadsheet or a PDF. (When the Frederick Police Department asked Axon how to create a list of Draft One reports, the Axon rep told them that feature wasn't available and they would have to follow the above method. "To set expectations, it’s not going to be graceful, but this wasn’t a scenario we anticipated needing to make easy," Axon wrote in August 2024, then suggested it might come up with a long-term solution. We emailed Axon back in March to see if this was still the case, but they did not provide a response.) Here's an excerpt from a PDF version from the Bishop Police Department in California: Here are some additional audit log examples: If you know the name of an individual officer, you can try to request their audit logs to see if they used Draft One. Since we didn't have a particular officer in mind, we had to get creative. An agency may manage their documents with one of a few different Axon offerings: Axon Evidence, Axon Records, or Axon Standards. The process for requesting records is slightly different depending on which one is used. We dug through the user manuals and came up with a few ways to export a random(ish) example. We also linked the manuals and gave clear instructions for the records officers. With Axon Evidence, an administrator can simply sort the system to show the 10 most recent users then export their usage logs. With Axon Records/Standard, the administrator has to start typing in a name and then it auto-populates with suggestions. So, we ask them to export the audit logs for the first few users who came up when they typed the letters M, J, and S into the search (since those letters are common at the beginning of names). Unfortunately, this method is a little bit of a gamble. Many officers still aren't using Draft One, so you may end up with hundreds of pages of logs that don't mention Draft One at all (as was the case with the records we received from Monroe County, NY). Language to try in your public records request: We knew the Draft One system offers department managers the option to customize how it can be used, including the categories of crime for which reports can be generated and whether or not there is a disclaimer automatically added to the bottom of the report disclosing the use of AI in its generation. So we asked for a copy of these settings and configurations. In some cases, agencies claimed this was exempted from their public records laws, while other agencies did provide the information. Here is an example from the Campbell Police Department in California: (It's worth noting that while Campbell does require each police report to contain a disclosure that Draft One was used, the California Public Records Act exempts police reports from being released.) Examples of settings: Language to try in your public records request: It can be helpful to know how much Draft One costs, how many user licenses the agency paid for, and what the terms of the agreement are. That information is often contained in records related to the contracting process. Agencies will often provide these records with minimal pushback or redactions. Many of these records may already be online, so a requester can save time and effort by looking around first. These are often found in city council agenda packets. Also, law enforcement agencies often will bump these requests to the city or county clerk instead. Here's an excerpt from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office in New York: These kinds of procurement records describe the nature and cost of the relationship between the police department and the company. They can be very helpful for understanding how much a continuing service subscription will cost and what else was bundled in as part of the purchase. Draft One, so far, is often accessed as an additional feature along with other Axon products. We received too many documents to list them all, but here is a representative example of some of the other documents you might receive, courtesy of the Dacono Police Department in Colorado. All training materials relevant to Draft One or Axon Narrative Assistant generated by this agency, including but not limited to: In addition to seeing when Draft One was used and how it was acquired, it can be helpful to know what rules officers must follow, what directions they're given for using it, and what features are available to users. That's where manuals, policies and training materials come in handy. User manuals are typically going to come from Axon itself. In general, if you can get your hands on one, this will help you to better understand the mechanisms of the system, and it will help you align the way you craft your request with the way the system actually works. Luckily, Axon has published many of the materials online and we've already obtained the user manual from multiple agencies. However, Axon does update the manual from time to time, so it can be helpful to know which version the agency is working from. Here's one from December 2024: Dacono Police Department - Axon Draft One User Guide Policies are internal police department guidance for using Draft One. Not all agencies have developed a policy, but the ones they do have may reveal useful information, such as other records you might be able to request. Here are some examples: Training and user manuals also might reveal crucial information about how the technology is used. In some cases these documents are provided by Axon to the customer. These records may illuminate the specific direction that departments are emphasizing about using the product. Here are a few examples of training presentations: Language to try in your public records request: Many departments are getting access to Draft One as part of a trial or pilot program. The outcome of those experiments with the product can be eye-opening or eyebrow-raising. There might also be additional data or a formal report that reviews what the department was hoping to get from the experience, how they structured any evaluation of its time-saving value for the department, and other details about how officers did or did not use Draft One. Here are some examples we received: Language to try in your public records request: • All communications sent or received by any representative of this agency with individuals representing Axon referencing the following term, including emails and attachments: • All communications sent to or received by any representative of this agency with each of the following email addresses, including attachments: Note: We are not including the specific email addresses here that we used, since they are subject to change when employees are hired, promoted, or find new gigs. However, you can find the emails we used in our requests on MuckRock. The communications we wanted were primarily the emails between Axon and the law enforcement agency. As you can imagine, these emails could reveal the back-and-forth between the company and its potential customers, and these conversations could include the marketing pitch made to the department, the questions and problems police may have had with it, and more. In some cases, these emails reveal cozy relationships between salespeople and law enforcement officials. Take, for example, this email exchange between the Dickinson Police Department and an Axon rep: Or this email between a Frederick Police Department sergeant and an Axon representative, in which a sergeant describes himself as "doing sales" for Axon by providing demos to other agencies. A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Emails like this also show what other agencies are considering using Draft One in the future. For example, in this email we received from the Campbell Police Department shows that the San Francisco Police Department was testing Draft One as early as October 2024 (the usage was confirmed in June 2025 by the San Francisco Standard). A machine readable text version of this email is available here. Your mileage will certainly vary for these email requests, in part because the ability for agencies to search their communications can vary. Some agencies can search by a keyword like "Draft One” or "Axon" and while other agencies can only search by the specific email address. Communications can be one of the more expensive parts of the request. We've found that adding a date range and key terms or email addresses has helped limit these costs and made our requests a bit clearer for the agency. Axon sends a lot of automated emails to its subscribers, so the agency may quote a large fee for hundreds or thousands of emails that aren't particularly interesting. Many agencies respond positively if a requester reaches out to say they're open to narrowing or focusing their request. One of the big questions is how do the Draft One-generated reports compare to the BWC audio the narrative is based on? Are the reports accurate? Are they twisting people's words? Does Draft One hallucinate? Finding these answers requires both obtaining the police report and the footage of the incident that was fed into the system. The laws and process for obtaining BWC footage vary dramatically state to state, and even department to department. Depending on where you live, it can also get expensive very quickly, since some states allow agencies to charge you not only for the footage but the time it takes to redact the footage. So before requesting footage, read up on your state’s public access laws or consult a lawyer. However, once you have a copy of a Draft One report, you should have enough information to file a follow-up request for the BWC footage. So far, EFF has not requested BWC footage. In addition to the aforementioned financial and legal hurdles, the footage can implicate both individual privacy and transparency regarding police activity. As an organization that advocates for both, we want to make sure we get this balance right. Afterall, BWCs are a surveillance technology that collects intelligence on suspects, victims, witnesses, and random passersby. When the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office gave us an AI-generated account of a teenager being hospitalized for suicidal ideations, we of course felt that the minor's privacy outweighed our interest in evaluating the AI. But do we feel the same way about a Draft One-generated narrative about a spring break brawl in Lake Havasu? Ultimately, we may try to obtain a limited amount of BWC footage, but we also recognize that we shouldn't make the public wait while we work it out for ourselves. Accountability requires different methods, different expertise, and different interests, and with this guide we hope to not only shine light on Draft One, but to provide the schematics for others–including academics, journalists, and local advocates–to build their own spotlights to expose police use of this problematic technology. Despite the variation in how agencies responded, we did have some requests that proved fruitful. You can find these requests and the documents we got via the linked police department names below. Please note that we filed two different types of requests, so not all the elements above may be represented in each link.

July 10, 2025 05:54 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Counter-UAS (C-UAS) Systems - Market and Technology Forecast to 2033" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This study examines, analyses, and predicts the evolution of C-UAS technologies, markets, and outlays (expenditures) over the 2025-2033 period in the aerospace industry. It also examines markets geographically, focusing on the top 95% of global markets, in the North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Throughout the report, we show how C-UAS systems are used today to add real value, as well as how will they can evolve in the near and distant future. To provide the most thorough and realistic forecast, this report considers all stated and derived scenarios. C-UAS systems are designed to detect, track, and neutralize unmanned aerial systems (UAS), performing the full spectrum of counter-drone operations. These platforms integrate a variety of sensors and mitigation tools to address specific mission requirements. Upon identifying a drone threat, a C-UAS system can respond using either soft-kill or hard-kill techniques. Soft-kill methods disrupt or take control of a drone without physical damage - forcing it to land, return to base, or enabling an operator to seize control. Hard-kill methods involve physically disabling or destroying the drone, often using kinetic or directed energy weapons to neutralize the threat. The market players include large as well as mid to small sized companies with expertise in manufacturing and system integration. The C-UAS market is at a nascent stage. The key factors driving the market are increasing deployment of drones for illicit reasons as well as rising drone warfare in areas of border tensions. In order to keep up with the evolving nature of threats from drone technologies, the technology required behind countermeasures for detection, tracking and mitigation of drones is becoming increasingly sophisticated. From radio waves to electro-optic/infrared to direct energy weapons, various effectors are being tested in different combinations to be integrated on C-UAS systems. Additionally, high-powered computing with integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) over 5G network is estimated to be a significant part in addressing the complex drone threats. These technological innovations will drive the spending in the market as they make the systems more efficient in addressing the threats and provide security to life and infrastructure against UAS attacks.

Title: WEKA Debuts NeuralMesh Axon For Exascale AI Deployments
URL: https://vmblog.com:443/archive/2025/07/08/weka-debuts-neuralmesh-axon-for-exascale-ai-deployments.aspx
Time Published: 2025-07-08T17:54:00Z
Full Content:
WEKA unveiled NeuralMesh Axon, a breakthrough storage system that leverages an innovative fusion architecture designed to address the fundamental challenges of running exascale AI applications and workloads. NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly fuses with GPU servers and AI factories to streamline deployments, reduce costs, and significantly enhance AI workload responsiveness and performance, transforming underutilized GPU resources into a unified, high-performance infrastructure layer. Building on the company's recently announced NeuralMesh storage system, the new offering enhances its containerized microservices architecture with powerful embedded functionality, enabling AI pioneers, AI cloud and neocloud service providers to accelerate AI model development at extreme scale, particularly when combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stacks for advanced model training and inference optimization. NeuralMesh Axon also supports real-time reasoning, with significantly improved time-to-first-token and overall token throughput, enabling customers to bring innovations to market faster. AI Infrastructure Obstacles Compound at Exascale Performance is make-or-break for large language model (LLM) training and inference workloads, especially when running at extreme scale. Organizations that run massive AI workloads on traditional storage architectures, which rely on replication-heavy approaches, waste NVMe capacity, face significant inefficiencies, and struggle with unpredictable performance and resource allocation. The reason? Traditional architectures weren't designed to process and store massive volumes of data in real-time. They create latency and bottlenecks in data pipelines and AI workflows that can cripple exascale AI deployments. Underutilized GPU servers and outdated data architectures turn premium hardware into idle capital, resulting in costly downtime for training workloads. Inference workloads struggle with memory-bound barriers, including key-value (KV) caches and hot data, resulting in reduced throughput and increased infrastructure strain. Limited KV cache offload capacity creates data access bottlenecks and complicates resource allocation for incoming prompts, directly impacting operational expenses and time-to-insight. Many organizations are transitioning to NVIDIA accelerated compute servers, paired with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, to address these challenges. However, without modern storage integration, they still encounter significant limitations in pipeline efficiency and overall GPU utilization. Built For The World's Largest and Most Demanding Accelerated Compute Environments To address these challenges, NeuralMesh Axon's high-performance, resilient storage fabric fuses directly into accelerated compute servers by leveraging local NVMe, spare CPU cores, and its existing network infrastructure. This unified, software-defined compute and storage layer delivers consistent microsecond latency for both local and remote workloads-outpacing traditional local protocols like NFS. Additionally, when leveraging WEKA's Augmented Memory Grid capability, it can provide near-memory speeds for KV cache loads at massive scale. Unlike replication-heavy approaches that squander aggregate capacity and collapse under failures, NeuralMesh Axon's unique erasure coding design tolerates up to four simultaneous node losses, sustains full throughput during rebuilds, and enables predefined resource allocation across the existing NVMe, CPU cores, and networking resources-transforming isolated disks into a memory-like storage pool at exascale and beyond while providing consistent low latency access to all addressable data. Cloud service providers and AI innovators operating at exascale require infrastructure solutions that can match the exponential growth in model complexity and dataset sizes. NeuralMesh Axon is specifically designed for organizations operating at the forefront of AI innovation that require immediate, extreme-scale performance rather than gradual scaling over time. This includes AI cloud providers and neoclouds building AI services, regional AI factories, major cloud providers developing AI solutions for enterprise customers, and large enterprise organizations deploying the most demanding AI inference and training solutions that must agilely scale and optimize their AI infrastructure investments to support rapid innovation cycles. Delivering Game-Changing Performance for Accelerated AI Innovation Early adopters, including Cohere, the industry's leading security-first enterprise AI company, are already seeing transformational results. Cohere is among WEKA's first customers to deploy NeuralMesh Axon to power its AI model training and inference workloads. Faced with high innovation costs, data transfer bottlenecks, and underutilized GPUs, Cohere first deployed NeuralMesh Axon in the public cloud to unify its AI stack and streamline operations. "For AI model builders, speed, GPU optimization, and cost-efficiency are mission-critical. That means using less hardware, generating more tokens, and running more models-without waiting on capacity or migrating data," said Autumn Moulder, vice president of engineering at Cohere. "Embedding WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon into our GPU servers enabled us to maximize utilization and accelerate every step of our AI pipelines. The performance gains have been game-changing: Inference deployments that used to take five minutes can occur in 15 seconds, with 10 times faster checkpointing. Our team can now iterate on and bring revolutionary new AI models, like North, to market with unprecedented speed." To improve training and help develop North, Cohere's secure AI agents platform, the company is deploying WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon on CoreWeave Cloud, creating a robust foundation to support real-time reasoning and deliver exceptional experiences for Cohere's end customers. "We're entering an era where AI advancement transcends raw compute alone-it's unleashed by intelligent infrastructure design. CoreWeave is redefining what's possible for AI pioneers by eliminating the complexities that constrain AI at scale," said Peter Salanki, CTO and co-founder at CoreWeave. "With WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon seamlessly integrated into CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure, we're bringing processing power directly to data, achieving microsecond latencies that reduce I/O wait time and deliver more than 30 GB/s read, 12 GB/s write, and 1 million IOPS to an individual GPU server. This breakthrough approach increases GPU utilization and empowers Cohere with the performance foundation they need to shatter inference speed barriers and deliver advanced AI solutions to their customers." "AI factories are defining the future of AI infrastructure built on NVIDIA accelerated compute and our ecosystem of NVIDIA Cloud Partners," said Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at NVIDIA. "By optimizing inference at scale and embedding ultra-low latency NVMe storage close to the GPUs, organizations can unlock more bandwidth and extend the available on-GPU memory for any capacity. Partner solutions like WEKA's NeuralMesh Axon deployed with CoreWeave provide a critical foundation for accelerated inferencing while enabling next-generation AI services with exceptional performance and cost efficiency." The Benefits of Fusing Storage and Compute For AI Innovation NeuralMesh Axon delivers immediate, measurable improvements for AI builders and cloud service providers operating at exascale, including:

Auckland medtech startup Formus Labs is about to crack the US market open - and be big in Japan. A conference hears that medtech is becoming a multibillion-dollar earner for NZ. One of our fastest-growing software firms just got a major profile boost in the United Kingdom, where it’s positioned to play a role in retail crime crackdown. Over the weekend, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper - whose portfolios includes policing - said shoplifters are to be barred from stores and prosecuted under plans for the first national database of repeat offenders. And it looks like a crime-reporting software platform made by Auckland-based Auror will play a key role in keeping the new database up-to-date. Cooper said she wanted more UK retailers to use Auror’s software, which aims to make it easier for retailers to report offences to police, including photos, and snippets of video taken on their cameras. The Home Secretary is urging police to make greater use of facial recognition technology and is behind the bill, currently winding its way through the UK Parliament. The controversial bill makes it an offence to conceal your identity from CCTV under certain circumstances (including protests), introduces the new offence of assaulting a retail worker and makes theft from a shop trial-able, regardless of the value of the goods (from a £200 [$450] threshold today). Stores including M&S, Morrisons, Boots, Tesco, Primark, and Greggs are submitting CCTV, photos and personal data on all their repeat shoplifters to Auror’s platform, which is shared with police. Cooper endorsed the Kiwi software after receiving a briefing from Boots, according to the UK’s Telegraph. Additionally, two Auror executives were recently invited to 10 Downing Street: UK and Europe vice president Mark Gleeson (a former tactical commander with the Royal Air Force) and UK director of law enforcement and partnerships Paul Fagg (who began his career as a police constable for London’s Metro Police and rose to become a police inspector with the National Business Crime Centre before joining Auror last year). Fagg said his firm’s crime intelligence platform enabled retailers to record everything that happens in their stores to tackle the “huge under-reporting issue”. “Police have access to Auror so that incidents they did not see before are now visible for them,” he said, adding that this enabled police and retailers to identify prolific offenders with CCTV and photographic evidence. The shared data enables all the stores and police to “join the dots” to identify prolific offenders, gather evidence for prosecutions and provide security staff on the shop doors with photo watchlists to bar entry, Fagg said. Auror says its system is used by 98% of retailers in NZ and 75% in Australia. In November last year, the Kiwi firm raised $82m at a $500m valuation, with the funds earmarked, in part, for a push to further expand in the US. The raise was led by two new investors: Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, a venture fund backed by five retailers including Tesco and Woolworths. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$70 billion ($115b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. On June 4, Axon and Auror announced a new Retail Crime Hub, which they billed as “unlocking a more efficient way for North American law enforcement agencies to collaborate with retailers and stop crime in our communities”. Auror already had a substantial beachhead in the US through anchor customer Walmart, founder Phil Thomson said. The new Retail Crime Hub should help it extend its reach. Thomson said a key issue was that while NZ has a single law enforcement authority (the police) dealing with retail crime, in the US it varied not just by state but by locality with some 18,000 agencies at the country level. Auror is pitched as a conduit to link them together for intel on retail crimes that fly well under the radar of national enforcement agencies. The fast-growing Auror has drawn a degree of privacy flak on both sides of the Tasman with a system that uses digital images which can misidentify people. But the firm has kept its nose clean with our Privacy Commissioner. Thomson emphasises that Auror doesn’t operate any security cameras and does not offer live facial recognition. Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster recently gave facial recognition trials by our two major supermarket chains his cautious tick of approval. And Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith says the option of having a centralised system of facial recognition is something he expects officials to consider. “We [Auror] acknowledge the calls from groups like Retail NZ, the UK Home Secretary, and NZ Government, for the use of technology such as facial recognition technology [FRT] in the retail sector,” Thomson told Tech Insider earlier today. “We support the responsible use of FRT by retailers to protect workers, shoppers and communities from violence and harm.” Thomson knows the legal and philosophical ins-and-outs (he’s a former intellectual property lawyer with Simpson Grierson and an ex-board member of the public-interest focused NZ Council of Legal Education). But he says his support for FRT is based on what’s happening every day in the real world. “With retail violence continuing to rise, it’s a no-brainer for retailers to explore how this technology [FRT] can be responsibly used in their stores. It’s already used in everyday environments such as airports, hotels and casinos,” he says. “Due to the increase in violence and crime in stores, in my view, it’s now not a matter of ‘if’ or ‘when’ - it’s about ‘how’ this can be deployed in the best way possible, protecting communities while also protecting privacy. “Retail crime isn’t victimless - it’s violence, it’s assault, and it’s organised. We know one in 10 events involve violence or use of a weapon. Ten % of top repeat offenders are responsible for more than 60% of the crime in Kiwi stores. Furthermore, repeat offenders are up to four times more likely to be violent.” Auckland-based med-tech Formus Labs will commercially launch in the key US market in a couple of months, founder and chief executive Dr Ju Zhang says. The launch follows the start-up gaining US Food and Drug Administration approval in December for its AI-powered, 3D software for planning orthopaedic surgeries - specifically hip replacements, with its FDA green light. Formus is lining up deals with the likes of hospital chains and insurance firms. Zhang says his firm has pilots already under way with several “tier one” and “tier two” players - with revenue above US$1 billion ($1.65b) or in the hundreds of millions, respectively. The start-up already has a close relationship with one of the biggest names in the field - Indiana-based Zimmer Biomet, with whom it’s partnered with in Australia since 2019. Zhang says with major commercial revenue just months away, there are no plans for another sizeable raise, though it’s possible Formus will stage a small round for bridging. (Its last major raise was US$5m ($8.25m) in early in a round led by Global From Day 1 and supported by Icehouse Ventures, Pacific Channel, Flying Kiwis and Punakaiki Fund). The FDA approval was a breakthrough moment as many regulators around the world take their lead from the US agency, Zhang says. Japan - a major market for orthopaedic technology - will be next cab-off-the-rank for the multi-Hi-Tech Awards winner. Australia is also a major market. Zhang says Formus consults closely with several orthopaedic surgeons in NZ but commercial maths means the primary focus has been across the Tasman and in North America. Regardless, he and his crew of 16 staff are based in Auckland, which he anticipated will remain the hub of the firm’s R&D. There’s a lot that’s high-tech about joint replacement surgery these days. But there’s also a lot of drilling, scraping, sawing and hammering. “In some ways, it’s a lot like carpentry,” Zhang says. Formus Lab’s software helps a surgeon more quickly and accurately prepare, and pick the right size joint replacement from what can run into hundreds of options. Currently one in 10 operations have to be redone and one in five have some degree of post-op complication. At a HealthTech Week event in Auckland last week, the audience heard that New Zealand’s MedTech sector currently generates around $2.6b in annual revenue and is projected to reach $3.8b by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% since 2018, according to Technology Investment Network, TIN200 stats. “It’s still dominated by the big fish; the likes of F&P Healthcare,” Callaghan Innovation HealthTech head Andrew Clews told Tech Insider. “But there is a second tier of companies coming through now that we’re supporting.” Clews says venture capital money is coming on board and the number of start-ups is increasing - thanks in part to a tight-knit ecosystem. Formus Labs is one of several medtechs spun out of Auckland University’s Bioengineering Institute, for example, he said. Others include Kitea Health, the maker of a world-first wireless implant for measuring brain pressure, Toku Eyes and Alimetry. The event was arranged by Te Tītoki Mataora, funded by Auckland University and MBIE and Callaghan Innovation’s HealthTech Activator. Both programmes offer various forms of support for medtech start-ups, although Callaghan Innovation is being disestablished. With most staff already laid off, the HealthTech Activator has funding to last through until a new advanced research agency is created around this time next year.
