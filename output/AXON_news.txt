Title: More CEOs demand ‘moonshot’ pay—billions in compensation for aggressive, seemingly impossible targets

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Good morning. If it seems like more CEOs are asking for—and getting—so-called “moonshot” pay packages, well, they are, as I reported in a recent feature for Fortune. A moonshot ties CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible targets over five to 10 years. The upshot is often billions in compensation and slices of company ownership. But in the meantime, the CEO gets almost nothing. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hit two moonshots, but the second award, once valued at $56 billion, was twice rescinded after a legal challenge. Taser stun gun and body camera company Axon Enterprise awarded its CEO Rick Smith a carbon copy of Musk’s deal in 2018 at a smaller magnitude. Smith blew the lights out and last year earned compensation valued at $165 million after growing the company’s market cap from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Smith even brought his entire workforce along with him by sharing some of his pay with employees, negotiating a deal where $88 million in stock went to the lowest-paid workers at Axon. His moonshot is also open to Axon workers, allowing them to put some of their pay at risk in a way similar to Smith’s comp. He’s now on a second seven-year moonshot plan, but even Smith’s wife was against the notion at first, because she thought it was just too risky. Now, the trend is poised to spread beyond founder-CEOs like Smith to what Todd Sirras of executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy calls “founder-anointed successors.” For instance, Opendoor Technologies CEO Kaz Nejatian got a potential $2.8 billion moonshot and a slice of the company after he was hired last month. But Sirras’ concern is that big bets on a single CEO pose major risks to shareholders. Human beings are emotional and they get distracted easily thinking about what they can buy with all this stock, he said, like a new private jet. He compared the potential rise of moonshot pay deals to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras said. While moonshots for founder-annointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T-Rex fence”—“awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland.” Read the full article here.—Amanda Gerut Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com AI bull run is too narrow, Morgan Stanley exec says Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer Lisa Shalett warned that the U.S. equity market’s remarkable run is built on a precariously narrow foundation: a surge in spending on, and optimistic assumptions about, infrastructure for artificial intelligence. This spending has fueled a boom in the shares of most of the so-called Magnificent 7 and a few dozen related businesses, which have now come to account for roughly 75% of the S&P 500’s returns since the rally began. AI companies may be underinsured, legally OpenAI and Anthropic may not be carrying enough insurance to pay all the legal claims against them from publishers whose work they have used to train their AI models, the FT reports. The companies may be required to use investor funds to pay off lawsuits. Kevin Kalinich, head of cyber risk at Aon, said “we don’t yet have enough capacity for [AI] providers”. SoftBank will buy ABB robotics for $5.4 billion “SoftBank’s next frontier is Physical AI. Together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics—driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward,” Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, said. Soybean farm crisis may need $24 billion bailout China, in response to President Trump’s trade war, has refused to buy U.S. soybeans this year, and it’s driving American farms into bankruptcy. Bailout packages for soy farms may cost taxpayers $24 billion, the WSJ reports, as the market for animal feed evaporates. Trump says federal workers may not get shutdown back pay “I would say it depends on who we’re talking about,” the president said yesterday, arguing that some workers “really don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way.” Red Lobster CEO’s recipe for a comeback 36-year-old Red Lobster CEO Damola Adamolekun is tasked with bringing the fast casual chain back to success following a tumultuous bankruptcy. He sees seafood boils and his own private equity savvy as ways ahead. Wall Street economist’s tariff predictions Wall Street economist Nathan Sheets told Fortune that the Trump Administration’s tariffs are unlike any we’ve seen “for many decades,” and could play out in two different ways. Retailers may subtly pass them off by raising prices during phases like the holiday season, though tariffs could also make some manufacturing unprofitable and bring about automation quicker.

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Could staking your compensation on an all-or-nothing bet make you a better leader—or just a higher-stakes gambler? That question is resurfacing in boardrooms as “moonshot” pay packages gain traction among CEOs and boards seeking to inspire extraordinary performance and lock in ambitious talent, writes my colleague Amanda Gerut. The concept, first thrust into the spotlight by Elon Musk’s 2018 Tesla deal, has reemerged in striking fashion through Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprise, the maker of Taser stun guns and police body cameras. In 2018, Smith accepted an unconventional offer: no bonuses, no meaningful salary (just $31,000 a year), and no equity unless he could grow Axon’s market cap tenfold over the next decade. Each $1 billion increase unlocked a tranche of stock, with the ultimate goal of lifting the company’s value from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. It was a daring bet, but one that paid off. Within five years, Smith had blown past each goal and became the highest-paid CEO in America in 2024 with $165 million in compensation. The stock surged more than 600%. Moonshot packages invert the standard logic of executive pay. Instead of the usual mix of salary, annual bonuses, and performance shares, they tie virtually all potential compensation to long-term milestones, often at seemingly impossible levels. Advocates argue that they strengthen alignment with shareholders, encourage long-term thinking, and inject urgency into the transformation process. Smith even extended a version of his plan to Axon employees, allowing them to trade portions of their pay for stock that vested alongside his. But the approach is not without controversy. The plans are highly volatile, difficult to calibrate, and often unpopular with investors wary of oversized payouts or asymmetric risk. Miss the mark, and the CEO gets nothing. Hit it too quickly, and shareholders may accuse boards of overpaying. Still, the model is spreading because, the rationale goes, extraordinary results demand extraordinary incentives, and in a market obsessed with innovation and valuation multiples, big bets may be the price of attracting and retaining elite executive talent. Whether these moonshots create enduring value or prove to be flashes of fortune remains an open question. What’s clear is that they represent a new frontier in corporate risk-taking—one that fuses pay, purpose, and performance into a single, high-stakes wager on leadership itself.
