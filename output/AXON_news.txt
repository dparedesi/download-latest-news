Plus: Wall Street Looks Forward To Fewer Regulations, Republican Election Wins Rally Markets, Crypto Prices Soar, Why Tax Cuts Might Take Some Time Investors, bankers and dealmakers are celebrating Donald Trump’s election victory last week. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes why: Republicans are known for being more business-friendly and less likely to enact strict regulations. And Donald Trump, who has made his distaste for regulations crystal clear, will have a Republican Senate and potentially a Republican House of Representatives to get his policies through. Many in the business world are hopeful Trump keeps his campaign promise of generous corporate tax cuts, and can fill the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission with leaders who will give more flexibility to business. Regardless of who won the election, 2025 was already expected to be a return to more active financial times. Inflation has moderated, interest rates have been slashed, markets are booming and the economic climate is right for M&A, IPOs and fundraising. Tight bank regulations enacted during the global financial crisis were being eased. Those are expected to be much less onerous now. “I consider this a watershed moment in turning the page for bank regulation. The post-Global Financial Crisis period is now over,” longtime Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo told Tucker. “The pendulum had already started to swing back, but now it’s likely to swing back even more.” But while businesses expect happier days, there are also potentially dark clouds on the horizon. On the campaign trail, one of Trump’s major economic plans was drastically increasing tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.—-potentially going as high as 100% for China or Mexico. Economists from differing philosophical backgrounds warn that would make everything more expensive for everyone in the U.S. While Trump has said this will force other countries to pay more to the U.S., Forbes’ Cyrus Farivar writes that tariffs don’t work that way in practice. Companies pass higher import duties to consumers, increasing the prices of all goods. Consumers respond by buying less. According to an analysis from the National Retail Federation, the effects of tariffs Trump’s proposal will be “dramatic,” especially since many products that are made in the U.S. use foreign-made components or materials. Some U.S. companies are scrambling to increase their imports—especially from China—to beat any tariffs before Trump takes office. Even without the presidential election, a global pandemic, supply shortages, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheaval have rapidly changed the business environment in the last five years. This has created many changes in the budgetary process. I talked with Andy West, a senior partner at McKinsey and global co-leader of its Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice, about how CFOs can adapt. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week, after the election. With Republicans’ ballot box victories came new highs for the stock market. Last week was Wall Street’s best of 2024, with all three major indexes rallying—the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.6%, the S&P 500 rose 4.7%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.7%. All three indexes continued consistent growth on Monday. The S&P crossed the 6,000 mark on Friday, and stayed there for much of Monday. But the gains were not just for the largest public companies. The Russell 2000 was up 8.5% last week. One of the companies that saw the most movement was Tesla, whose market cap passed $1 trillion on Friday for the first time since 2022. Since the election, the company’s stock is up about 35%. CEO Elon Musk’s supercharged support for Trump—both on the campaign trail and as one of his largest political donors, providing the campaign about $130 million—helped drive Tesla’s rally, which appears to be cooling off a bit today. However, Tesla isn’t the biggest Trump beneficiary on the stock market, nor is it the only one seeing its fortunes rise from Trump’s campaign trail priorities. Private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group—both of which are Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors—have seen their stock up 76% and 75%, respectively. And Taser parent Axon Enterprise has seen 40% growth. Adding fuel to the economic fire was the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates by 0.25% at its meeting last week, bringing them to 4.5% to 4.75%. Unlike the market rally, the cut had nothing to do with the election. It was widely expected due to falling inflation rates—which were down to 2.1% last month, according to the Commerce Department—and a 4.1% unemployment rate. However, analysts cautioned that the Fed’s planned wind-down of interest rates, which were hiked due to high inflation that peaked in 2022, may not unfold as initially anticipated due to the uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans. Chesnot/Getty Images Cryptocurrency is also seeing a gigantic boost from Trump’s win. Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, has seen its price skyrocket to more than $86,000 since Trump’s election. Trump ran as a cryptocurrency-friendly candidate, promising to fire Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler and roll back regulations on cryptocurrency at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. Trump has also said he would like to create a strategic national bitcoin reserve. With the election of blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno as a new Republican senator from Ohio—unseating former Senate Banking Committee and strict cryptocurrency regulation supporter Sen. Sherrod Brown—it could be easier for pro-cryptocurrency laws to get through Congress. Trump’s family also stands to personally benefit from looser regulations on cryptocurrency. In September, he started a new cryptocurrency business venture called World Liberty Financial. It’s run by his older sons Don Jr. and Eric. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on Tuesday. With Republican control of the White House and at least the Senate, fast tax cuts are expected. Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb writes that tax cuts are likely on the way, but it may take a while before they’re reflected in what businesses are paying the government. It has to do with the budgetary processes in Congress. While Republicans will have a majority in the Senate, most bills they bring up will be able to be filibustered by Democrats—a strong likelihood in this case. A majority of senators can consider financial bills through a process called reconciliation, which has special rules. These bills can only deal with spending and revenues for a limited time, meaning they usually have to expire—which is why tax cuts from Trump’s first term are sunsetting in 2025. And even with broad agreement on the big things, it does take some time to get agreement on the details. Erb points out that the previous round of Trump tax cuts wasn’t approved until December 20, 2017, nearly a year into his term. McKinsey Senior Partner and Global Coleader of Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice Andy West. After about a decade of relative stability, the last five years have delivered financial uncertainty to companies as pandemics, supply chain issues, inflation and geopolitical upheavals have impacted businesses across the globe. That’s changed the CFO’s budgeting process significantly, and leaders who do better recognize that some of these issues should be seen as more permanent conditions, said Andy West, senior partner and coleader of McKinsey’s Global Strategy and Corporate Finance practice. I talked to him about some of the changes in the CFO’s budgeting process. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What are some of the bigger issues to address as CFOs are putting together budgets right now? West: The biggest is around granularity, in terms of how granular you need to be when making decisions. Instead of wrapping it up in a product line or a business unit, and talking about things like total revenue, as you have impacts like inflation on price, or supply chain risk on volume, [you should be] decoupling that in price and volume. What are our assumptions and how do we think about that? In a multi-business company, multiple product lines are completely affected by these risks. Some may be status quo, others might be having a massive impact on the supply chain and can no longer price or supply the way that we expected. The specificity with which budgets need to be evaluated is increasing in a lot of different ways. We also see an expansion from just financial metrics to finance and operating-driven metrics. I have a client that [is] a contract manufacturer. For them, instead of just setting budgets, they need to bound their financial budgets by what’s operationally feasible. You used to be able to say, ‘I’m just going to set a budget 10% higher than last year, and that seems right.’ Now we have to understand our aspirations for spending 10% higher than last year. Is that consistent with what’s happening with our unit costs? If you are setting a budget that is impossible to execute, you need to know that. That was not a factor before. You knew that last year was going to be the same as this year. That level of de-layering is really important. The last one that is really interesting is cadence. The annual budget cycle used to be [on a regular] cadence, which is a year. What you’re seeing now is that’s insufficient for the amount of risk and uncertainty in the world and the budget. They’re either managing that with holdbacks and then they’re releasing budgets as they go, or they’re changing the cadence and saying, we’re going to do quarterly budgeting. What is most interesting is organizations that are getting more granular are also thinking about the cycle in a more granular way. Old business, same assumptions, that’s the good old yearly cycle, and we’re going to do it the old way because the new way is more expensive and more complicated to execute. But these two strategic initiatives are going to be on a faster flywheel and we’re going to look at them in isolation in order to manage the risk. This new budgeting strategy is a departure from how things have been done in the last 10 to 15 years. But all of this uncertainty is not a unique occurrence for business in general. What time periods could CFOs learn from? There will be a handful of executives who were making business decisions in the 1970s. I think when we look at the different eras of business and economic performance, one of the things that typically draws us back to that era is [the] supply constraints that we’re dealing with right now. Supply of energy, scarce resources, less economic stability, a bit more polarization in the world. Where we are right now is a different era than the ‘70s, but if you go back to some of the fundamentals and how long it took to work through things like energy supply—which was a big problem in the ‘70s—it took years. I think that’s the situation that we’re in right now: Years to get the budgeting updated, years to pivot on strategy, years to find a way to manage around some of the global issues. I think we’re seeing a fairly resilient consumer right now, but until we work through these structural challenges, we are still going to have some uncertainty. What advice would you give to a CFO working through this process? Take it seriously. The changes you’re making now are a lot of work, but it will lead you to an inherently better place because the world’s likely not going back. These changes are a good thing. I would say keep granularity in mind. It is really important for the CFO and the finance function to help the organization understand performance and make sure that resources are being reallocated accordingly. And I would also say embrace the strategic moment. CFOs have, for the last decade, become closer and closer to general operators, and become more and more strategic. This is only a continued evolution of their role and an opportunity to lean into the moment.

Title: Tesla Stock Dips 2% As Post-Election Surge Cools Off

Shares of Tesla slipped Tuesday as part of a broader cooling off among the hottest trades following last week’s election of Donald Trump, though the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker remains far more valuable than it was prior to Election Day. People look at a Cybertruck at a Tesla dealership in Manhattan. Tesla stock fell 6%, its first daily loss since last Monday. That pares Tesla’s post-election gain to a still eye-popping 31%, as investors flooded into the stock following Trump’s victory on optimism about what Musk’s close alliance with Trump would mean for Tesla. “The magnitude” of Tesla stock’s post-election surge “surprised us,” Deutsche Bank analysts led by Edison Yu remarked in a Tuesday note to clients. Accompanying Tesla’s slip Tuesday were losses for some other assets which rallied after the Trump win. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase lost 2%, the stock of Axon Enterprise, the Taser stun gun parent which was the only S&P 500 company to outperform Tesla from Election Day through Monday, dipped 3%, private prison companies CoreCivic and Geo Group sank more than 5% apiece and analytics-focused defense contractor Palantir slipped 1%. Major indexes were only down slightly, with the S&P and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both losing less than 0.3%. “Elon Musk’s emergence from a political ‘outsider’ to having a voice in potential policies may, at some level, accelerate Tesla’s journey beyond autos,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a Tuesday note to clients. American leadership in Tesla’s core ambitions like electric and autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robotics “is going to involve government and industrial partnership on a scale some have compared to the Manhattan Project, US Highway Act or the Apollo Missions,” Jonas added. Musk’s net worth fell by about $12 billion Tuesday as Tesla shares fell. His $308 billion net worth is still more than $75 billion higher than the next-wealthiest person in the world, Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, while Musk is still almost $50 billion richer than he was before the election. Tesla added more than $340 billion in market value in the week ending Monday, eclipsing a $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time since April 2022 in the process. Yu outlined several near-term factors behind the surge, including “retail exuberance” and short trade unwinding “due to lack of near-term negative catalysts.” But Yu wrote there are “potential large” benefits for Tesla under a Trump regime with Musk a close advisor, including “streamlining” regulatory approval of Tesla’s self-driving cars and the potential for Tesla to secure further market share in the U.S. with the potential cutback of federal tax credits for electric vehicles. Tesla stock led a broader rally for U.S. equities since the election, with the S&P up 4% over the last week, trading above 6,000 for the first time ever as Wall Street celebrated the positive earnings impact of the lower corporate tax rates backed by Trump.

Title: Kiwi retail crime intelligence firm Auror raises $82 million from Taser maker, grocery giants

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Auror, an Auckland-based maker of crime reporting and prevention software, has raised $82 million in a Series C venture capital (VC) round – one of the largest for a Kiwi firm - at a valuation north of $500m. If, say, a group of three people shoplift items from a supermarket then run out the door, the store can use Auror templates to quickly file a report with head office and police, including the likes of a snippet of CCTV footage, stills from facial or number plate recognition systems, and witness statements. Auror co-founder and CEO Phil Thomson says it can save a retailer like Woolworths or Z Energy one to two hours in filing time, and police one to seven hours per incident. A study by Sense Partners found in the 12 months to June 2023, police realised $92m and 170,000 hours of savings through workforce efficiency gains by investigating crime and requesting information more efficiently via Auror – a sum that, on paper at least, would fund another 450 police officers. Where’s the prevention element if our supermarket offenders simply legged it? “A lot of retail crime is very well-organised,” Thomson says. Around 10% of offenders are responsible for 60% of losses. Auror’s information helps retailers and police establish who the offenders are, and their patterns of offending – important as many gangs aim to execute multiple heists in a day, whether that’s dramatic ram raids or quieter shoplifting. “Proceeds go to guns, drugs and gangs,” he says. The funds will bankroll a further push into the US, co-founder and chief executive Phil Thomson says. More artificial intelligence tools will also be added, though Thomson. “We focus on responsible AI. It can make a workflow 10 times faster, but we want to keep a human in the loop.” An Auror AI might be able to make connections between crimes that elude an investigator sifting through millions of lines of spreadsheet entries, he says. The raise was led by two new investors, Axon Enterprise (formerly Taser International) and W23, plus returning Sydney VC fund Reinventure, which includes Westpac as its largest limited partner. Nasdaq-listed Axon – which has a US$46 billion ($77b) market cap – invented the Taser in the 1970s. In the 2000s it expanded into bodycams, then computer-aided dispatch software and a cloud-based digital evidence platform. The firm was already an Auror technology partner. W23 is a venture fund backed by five grocery retailers: Tesco (UK, Ireland, Europe), Woolworths Group (Australia and New Zealand), Shoprite Group (Africa), Sobeys (Canada) and Ahold Delhaize (US, Europe and Indonesia). Auror already has a substantial beachhead in North America. “Walmart in the US is one of our flagship customers,” Thomson says. (All up, his firm works with some 45,000 retail stores worldwide.) Yet the US has a much more complicated landscape on the law enforcement side. Auror has a close relationship with law enforcement in New Zealand – smoothed by the fact we have a single police force. The US, by contrast, has some 18,000 agencies going down to the county level, Thomson says. READ MORE: Newly minted unicorn: Jamie Beaton’s Crimson raises $68m at $1 billion valuation That’s where Axon could have a key role in opening doors. “They sell Tasers or bodycams to almost every police force in the US – and the UK and elsewhere.” Another aspect of the US market is “most of those police forces will have different systems that don’t talk to each other”, Thomson says. “If you’re a criminal, you’re going across different county lines and state lines, and so historically, that hasn’t been actually connected together.” He sees that as an opportunity. Thomson is mum on financials but says its revenue, of which 85% is earned offshore, grew by 150% between 2022 and 2024. He says the firm got profitable before its $30m Series B raise in 2021, led by local VC firm Movac. Other investors include Shasta Ventures, Global From Day One, the Crown-backed NZ Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP) via its Aspire fund and Sir Stephen Tindall’s ubiquitous K1W1. “We still have really high conviction in the company but given our funding model – that is, our investments and operating costs are paid entirely out of Aspire realisations – we decided to take the opportunity to take some money off the table during this round,” NZGCP chief investment officer James Pinner told the Herald. The tough venture capital market and economic slowdown notwithstanding, NZGCP is on something of a roll. It recently realised a $37m profit from its early investment in education software maker Kami. Pinner won’t give a dollar figure for Auror, but says “Auror has already delivered back to us well over 10 times the total capital we invested since 2014.” “Part of this round was about making room for those new investors and allowing some of those early shareholders to take some off the table,” Thomson says. “NZGCP’s first investment was back in 2014 and it’s been a really good return for them. They’re not taking out all of their stake. But it’s a mark of success that we’ve been able to generate that return for them, that they could get and invested back into new Kiwi companies.” “We also worked with our team to sell down some of the Esop [employee stock ownership programme], realising some of that financial security.” In July, Australia’s Office of the Australian Information Commissioner started making ‘preliminary inquiries’ after Australian Federal Police said they had started using Auror’s platform without conducting a proper privacy review first. Auror says the OAIC dropped its probe last month. Thomson stresses his firm doesn’t operate any cameras. “We make reporting software,” he says. He pitches that privacy is part of the firm’s DNA. He didn’t work in software, retail or law enforcement before co-founding Auror in 2012. Rather, he worked as an associate at law firm Simpson Grierson, specialising in intellectual property and privacy. He argues a “secure, online evidence locker” used with Auror better protects privacy than the mix of written reports, documents and USB sticks used previously. And while automated number plate recognition has raised concerns about privacy abuse (notably when police used it to illegally track two suspects during Covid lockdowns), Thomson says when it’s paired with Auror’s platform, it has a positive social benefit. He says Auror customer Z Energy reduced its losses from drive-aways by 73% after introducing number plate recognition. Attendants no longer had to make a value judgment based on their perception of how a customer looked. The licence plate detection made it black and white. If a vehicle was a previous drive-away, they did not get pre-pay. “It removes bias.” Thomson adds that 20% of retail crime involves aggression or violence – which he says Auror can help to tamp down. “If you imagine who’s in those stores, it might be a 16-year-old on the checkout doing their first fulltime job or a 60-year-old who’s been doing it for 30 or 40 years. They’re the ones on the front line being impacted by this emotionally and physically.” The firm has 220 staff worldwide, including 80 hired over the past 12 months, Thomson says. Some 150 are based in Auckland, where research and development work takes place. Around 40 are in an office in Denver. The firm has also opened an office in London. While ambitions are global, the core R&D team - established in Morningside in 2012 - will stay local, Thomson says. “We’ve chosen to keep our R&D here. We believe in the New Zealand ecosystem,” Thomson says. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

LISBON, PORTUGAL - NOVEMBER 28: A Maritime Police Commando carries a Taser 7 gun during a ceremony ... [+] to deliver them attended by State Secretary for National Defense Carlos Lopes Pires, the Portuguese Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, and the Director General of the Maritime Authority and Commander General of the Maritime Police Vice Admiral João Dores Aresta at the House of Scales, Central Navy facilities, on November 28, 2023, in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Horacio Villalobos#Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON), best known for its products, including taser and body cams for the law enforcement agencies, surged nearly 30% on Friday, November 8, after the company posted a solid Q3 beat and raised its outlook. Axon reported revenue of $544 million and earnings of $1.45 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $527 million and $1.20 respectively. The company is benefiting from increased adoption for its products, amid continued innovation. Separately, after a big rise, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold Insulet (PODD) Stock? For example, Axon's Draft One uses generative AI to convert the audio from the body cam into a report narrative draft. Also, it can translate over 100 languages. Such offerings help improve the efficiency of the police force. Axon's Taser sales surged 36% y-o-y to $221.7 million in Q3, its Cloud & Services sales were also up 36%, while Sensors & Other revenue was up 18%. The company-wide sales were up 32%, driven by continued demand for Taser and body cams. Not only did Axon see strong sales growth, its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 400 bps y-o-y to 26.7% in Q3. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in a bottom line of $1.45, versus 1.05 in the prior-year quarter. This year has been spectacular for AXON stock, with returns of 133%, compared to 25% gains for the broader S&P500 index. Admirably, AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes from the new Trump presidency, could AXON see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think AXON is fully valued at levels of around $600. At its current levels, AXON stock is trading at 25x trailing revenues, versus the stock's average P/S ratio of 12x over the last five years. Now, some rise in the valuation multiple seems justified, given the strong sales and earnings growth. An increased adoption of its products bodes well for the stock in the long run, given that the company earns recurring revenues from sales of cartridges and services for its products. Then there is the Trump factor. Law enforcement agencies are expected to be well funded under the Trump administration. There is a possibility of increased spending on technologies and products to improve security. Axon recently acquired Dedrone to expand its security offerings, and it is expected to see an increased adoption going forward. That said, Axon's valuation multiple has now risen 2x compared to its historical average, making the stock look expensive, in our view. While AXON stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Separately, look at what's happening with Delta stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The S&P 500 index surged past the 6,000-point milestone, setting fresh record highs, and small-cap stocks are poised for their best weekly performance since April 2024 as investor optimism surrounding the “Trump trade” continued to fuel a strong risk-on sentiment by the end of a wild week in the market. All major U.S. indices posted modest gains in midday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading slightly, soaring beyond the 44,000-point mark. The blue-chip index is set for its best weekly performance in over a year. Friday's rise in the S&P 500 was powered by the utilities and real estate sectors, which had lagged post-election. Tech stocks took a breather following Thursday's rally. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 7%, pushing its weekly gains beyond 27% and propelling its market cap past $1 trillion. This move now places every "Magnificent Seven" tech stock in the trillion-dollar club, with the group's combined market cap topping $17 trillion. Treasury yields held steady, while the dollar strengthened in response to the Federal Reserve's Thursday 25-basis-point rate cut to 4.5%-4.75%.

Title: AXON’s Sci-Fi Reality Machine: Visionary Leadership In Action
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwolcott/2024/11/08/axons-sci-fi-reality-machine-visionary-leadership-in-action/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T17:40:03Z
Full Content:
Tony Stark lives in Scottsdale—or at least his doppelganger: Rick Smith, founder and CEO of AXON, a $30 billion market cap leader in public safety technology markets. Few entrepreneurs deserve the “visionary” moniker more than Smith. From AXON’s founding in a garage in 1993, the company has grown from its original Taser products to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise with the purpose to “Protect Lives.” AXON Founder Rick Smith plays up the moon landing theme at the company's TASERCON2023 conference. Over the past five years alone, their shares have returned nearly 700%. AXON joined the S&P 500 in 2023. (FYI, I’m a shareowner.) I recently visited AXON to interview Smith and AXON’s president Josh Isner. (Video of our conversation here.) Smith and Isner represent a rare combination: a visionary leadership dyad. Think, Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX, or Steve Jobs and Tim Cook at Apple. Smith brings the sci-fi. Isner and team create the reality. Arriving at AXON’s headquarters, you’ll enter through a peculiar portal—an oval-shaped stainless steel room managing access via facial recognition (or via their friendly receptionist, Laura Rodriquez). The lobby of AXON's headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, September 27, 2024, modeled after a similar ... [+] lobby in the film Men In Black— though the space suit is an AXON addition. AXON’s communications lead Alexandra Engel quipped with a smile, “Rick wanted an entrance like the one in Men In Black, so that’s what we got.” Catwalks crisscross the complex. That’s due to Smith’s observation that, “every great lightsaber fight happens on a catwalk.” It’s all part of AXON’s dynamic, discerning what customers might desire in the future and making it so. During its first decade, AXON (originally known as Taser) experienced exponential growth and significant growing pains. Smith recalls, “Early in my career I had Steve Jobs syndrome,” so he didn’t listen well to customers. After market-defining initial successes, “we had 2 or 3 contemporaneous failures.” AXON Founder Rick Smith and President Josh Isner join Professor Rob Wolcott at AXON's headquarters ... [+] for a conversation, September 27, 2024. Smith and Isner represent a "visionary leadership dyad," where complementary capabilities, vision and high trust combine to generate long-term outperformance. Smith realized he was part of the problem. "I’m really not good at hiring people [or] having hard conversations.” After Smith’s management epiphany, he started trusting others to run operations, freeing himself to live in the future. As Isner rose to lead sales and eventually to the chief operating role, Smith increasingly relied on him not only to manage the business, but also to challenge him. Isner “pushes back” when the superhero founder goes too far. “There’s this dynamic tension between the two of us, which is good.” Smith connects the dots between customers and AXON’s product development team, while Isner runs the business. Smith muses, “If he weren’t doing this, Josh would probably be Bill Belichick,” referencing one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time. AXON President Josh Isner (center foreground) rallies colleagues at AXON Fest 2024, the company's ... [+] annual leadership confab. Other visionary entrepreneurs faced similar journeys. After founding Dell in his dorm room, Michael Dell eventually learned to rely on exceptional managers like Kevin Rollins to transform the company from a scrappy challenger to industry-leading enterprise. Visionary leadership dyads work when two individuals combine complementary capabilities, vision and high trust to generate long-term outperformance. No matter how compelling the ideas emanating from the C-suite, Smith asserts, “creativity is a team sport.” One of the ways AXON inspires and focuses its teams’ creativity is an approach I call reframing: reframing challenges and asking better questions. Early on, the company focused on making better tasers. That’s great, but not enough to lead the future. Smith admonished, “Our job is not just to sell the next version of taser. How do we make the bullet obsolete? I challenge you guys to give me a weapon that outperforms a bullet in stopping power.” As a result, they started discovering far more innovative answers and offerings. AXON Founder Rick Smith makes a point during an interview with the author and AXON's President Josh ... [+] Isner. Unlike most companies, AXON doesn’t allow its current capabilities and products to define its boundaries. AXON’s vision is bounded by possible future customer needs, rather than by AXON’s current businesses, or even by what customers say they want. AXON’s team listens intently, but also scans horizons. Customers rarely ask for breakthroughs. AXON Skydio drone control and monitoring systems. After partnering with Skydio in the marketplace, ... [+] AXON acquired the company in 2024. In a 2017 future concept video, AXON envisioned a rapid-responsive future of policing. For instance, the video proposed AI-powered completion of police reports from bodycam data—not possible at the time. In April 2024, AXON made it real with the launch of Draft One. Imagine the hours officers can now reallocate to achieving their missions. Starting in the 2010s, AXON closely monitored advancements in drones. In 2018 they launched AXON Air with external partners. Later in 2024, the company acquired two of those drone company partners, Sky-Hero and Dedrone. AXON cultivated partnerships and expertise, building optionality and offerings before the competition. An officer operates an AXON-enabled drone in the field. AXON’s strategy reflects the essence of what my co-author Kaihan Krippendorff and I term Proximity in our recent book by the same name. Proximity observes that digital technologies compel value creation ever closer to the moment of demand. I first started sharing Proximity on Forbes in 2017. AXON brings more and more capabilities closer to the moment of need for public safety professionals. Drones for situational awareness and rapid response, AI-completed police reports, virtual reality for training—anything, anywhere, anytime. That’s quintessential Proximity, and it’s winning. Smith offers a provocative perspective on the ethics of technology and public safety. Reflecting on the 2002 film Minority Report, he challenges conventional wisdom. Many people interpret the film as posing a dystopic future. “They had a technology that took murders to zero in a violent country, took false convictions to zero.” Smith counters that logic. One person gets framed and that invalidates the entire system? “To me, that is an unimaginably crazy good system.” Tom Cruise runs in a scene from the film 'Minority Report', 2002. (Photo by 20th Century-Fox/Getty ... [+] Images) The AXON team engages across the public safety community in rigorous ethical dialogues, which evolve as technologies and threats change. Technologies like predictive AI must operate within accountable systems designed to minimize bias and uphold individual rights. Advancing public safety while maintaining public trust will be essential to ensure communities feel both protected and respected. AXON’s commitment to public safety and technological innovation finds its most ambitious expression in “Moonshot 2032.” AXON’s initiative endeavors to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% over a decade. AXON’s moonshot motivates continuous exploration of public safety challenges, addressed with the latest technologies, equipping public safety agencies to respond faster and more effectively while simultaneously protecting lives. Smith at AXON's Moonshot 2032 launch event in 2022. Smith’s vision for AXON’s future remains bold and cinematic. The company’s stunning new headquarters under development amps the sci-fi theme: more catwalks and a platform reminiscent of the scene from The Empire Strikes Back, where Luke Skywalker discovers his father. Rather than becoming the Evil Empire, Smith aspires for AXON to remain the rebel force. “I’m terrified. I want to continue to be the disruptor—and not the disrupted. Meanwhile, life is better with lightsabers. AXON's 2022 launch event for their Moonshot 2032: Cut gun-related deaths between police and the ... [+] public by 50% in 10 years. The Moonshot manifests AXON's purpose and inspires AXON team members and partners to pursue meaningful positive change. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: These stocks returned 30%+ in the first week of November

Investing.com -- It's no secret that stock investors have been bagging juicy gains in November, pushed mainly by the market pricing in a second Trump mandate, the end of election uncertainty, and a persistently dovish Fed. But while virtually all bulls are getting their fair share of profits, the magnitude of these gains will vary wildly. That's where ProPicks AI users are leading the pack. In fact, only in the first week of November, they garnished an eye-popping 35%+ gain on three stocks. To wit: Now, honestly, what was the last time you bagged results like that without the help of advanced machine-learning-powered stock-picking models? I sure haven't. But there's no need to worry; there's still time to get all our picks for November with up to 55% using this link, as part of our exclusive Early Bird Black Friday sale. Already a Pro user? Make sure you've seen this month's list! On top of these rallies, our users are also getting big bucks on several earnings season winners. In fact, just to talk about today, they are already up 15.2% on Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), which has just crushed earnings and forward guidance. But how do we do it? Is it some sort of 'AI magic?' Of course not. ProPicks AI works because it offers a simple, industry-recognized approach to fundamental analysis by using extensive sets of data big data modeling. By comparing all stocks in the market at a glance, it manages to surface several hidden gems with investment-grade precision, thus improving returns and helping lower risks. That's how, unlike other models, our AI identifies undervalued names before they become too expensive. Instead of relying solely on momentum models, our approach integrates decades of comprehensive stock market fundamental and technical data, channeling a multitude of data sets to provide out premium users with market-beating stock strategies. In fact, our backtest suggests that going for the long run will give you even heftier gains. See chart below for reference: Source: ProPicks This means a $100K principal in our strategy would have turned into an eye-popping $1,848,800K by now. So, will you risk going another month without the super-human power of AI data processing? For less than $9 a month, that decision has never been easier.
