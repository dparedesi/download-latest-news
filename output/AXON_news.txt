The rupee declined 6 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 84.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as weak domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows dented market sentiment. Forex traders said investors were also cautious ahead of the US Fed meeting outcome. Moreover, overnight gains in crude oil prices also weighed on the local unit. However, a correction in the dollar index against major currencies helped the rupee and restrained the slide, they added. Aurionpro Solutions, a leading technology provider, has secured a significant contract from Chennai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (CMRL) to deliver automated fare collection (AFC) systems for Phase II of the Chennai Metro. The shares of Aurionpro Solutions Limited were trading at ₹1,665 down by ₹30 or 1.77 per cent during the closing bell. Swiggy IPO has been subscribed 0.34 times as of 3.36 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.28 times, NII 0.12 times, retail 0.81 times, and those reserved for employees 1.11 times. The issue closes on November 8, 2024.

Top gainers: Apollo Hospitals (6.67%), SBI (0.50%), HDFC Life (0.37%), TCS (0.19%), L&T (0.19%) Top losers: Hindalco (-8.42%), Trent (-6.91%), Grasim (-3.34%), Shriram Finance (-3.03%), Tech Mahindra (-2.67%) Stocks advanced on BSE at 3 pm on November 7, 2024, were 1,834 against 2,079 stocks that declined, and 121 remained unchanged. Total stocks traded were 4,034. The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 240, and those that hit a 52-week low was 13. A total of 350 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 198 in the lower circuit. The Nifty opened within the range of the previous day, and has slid since after an attempt to build on yesterday’s advance. For the day, support near 24,400 will be key. This is because any close under this level will create a “bearish dark cloud cover”. If the decline worsens, then participants will be watching yesterday’s open 24,309 closely - if the market ends below this marker it will create the more powerful “bearish engulfing”. For the last few days, 24,500 has served as resistance and will continue to be the critical upside hurdle going forward. On the downside, 24,309 and 24,204 will be key levels to watch. Niva Bupa Health Insurance Company IPO has been subscribed 0.54 times as of 2.27 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.78 times, NII 0.03 times, and retail 0.56 times. The issue closes on November 11, 2024. Almost 50% valuation compared to Zomato gives some comfort although it should not be considered as an arbitrage in valuation. If Swiggy’s EBITDA catches up to 3-4% in the food delivery business, which is currently at 1% and Average Order Value (AOV) improves to Rs. 550-600 levels in quick commerce with higher non-grocery share, we can see bridging in the valuation gap. Although, this should not be expected in near term. ​Sagility India IPO​ has been subscribed 2.32 times as of 2.18 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 2.65 times, NII 0.93 times, retail 3.42 times, and those reserved for employees 3.26 times. The issue closes today. Brokerage Motilal Oswal recognised that Swiggy pioneered the hyperlocal commerce industry in India, launching food delivery in 2014 and quick commerce in 2020, and is well-recognised as a leader in innovation. Swiggy operates in an oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Motilal analysts remarked that the food delivery platform’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering.

The decisive win by Trump of the US mandate, stronger than expected, the probability of easing of tensions in the middle east is now a high possibility. At the same time, his statements over the next few weeks could put some cats amongst the pigeons as he makes noises on China, Russia, Oil and of course, renewables. With the USD gaining strength, Gold – being inversely related, is bound to fall and therefore the Fed meeting today holds great importance as to the future direction of bonds and the dollar. On the one hand the pre election rhetoric points to yields hardening in the US, growth and incremental data is unlikely to change the trajectory that the central banks wish to take and will act as a counter. Hence a bit of bumpiness is expected in the next 2-3 weeks and maybe right upto the President elect assuming office in January. Gold as of now remains on an uptrend but like we have been saying, tight stops are necessary especially if the pivots around USD 2600 are challenged as that would mark a significant break. Till then, its anticipated that the initial kneejerk reaction on the USD may reverse esp if President Trump talks around higher deficits that could put pressure on the USD. “ Driven by tractor and automobile sales, Mahindra & Mahindra is expected to report strong revenue growth in Q2.
