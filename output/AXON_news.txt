The broader tech, media, and telecommunications sector is one of the hottest corners of the market, and UBS shared its top picks this week. Within the S&P 500, tech stocks are up 20% year-to-date, while communications services stocks are up 22%. That handily outpaces the broader index, which is up just 13% from levels at the start of the year. In a note to clients, analysts at UBS highlighted 10 buy-rated stocks within the two sectors, which represented the bank's "highest-conviction calls" in that segment of the market. The calls also reflected companies where UBS had a "differentiated view" or proprietary data that supported its bullish call, analysts said. Here are the top stocks on the bank's radar: Ticker: NIQ Year-to-date performance: -16% Predicted upside: +56% Analyst reasoning: "Following its 2021 transformation, including ~$920m in investments ($400m in technology, $520m across deals, and Fetch), NIQ is positioned for ~5% organic CC revenue growth (2024-27E). We model adjusted EBITDA margin improving +550bps to 24.1% by 2027E, driven by cost efficiencies and equity quality enhancements." Ticker: DIS Year-to-date performance: +2% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "We remain bullish on Disney shares and continue to view parks as a value driver (which should improve as new attractions/cruise capacity comes online)," analysts wrote. "This supports our view that Disney can grow EPS at a ~17% CAGR through F27 vs. the Street's ~13%." Ticker: AMT Year-to-date performance: +6% Predicted upside: +35% Analyst reasoning: "AMT is poised to benefit from increased U.S. carrier activity (AT&T amendments post-Echostar spectrum acquisition; VZ/TMUS densification) and accelerated international growth, driving 6-8% annual AFFO/sh growth from '25-'27E, up from ~1% recently." Ticker: AMZN Year-to-date performance: -0.4% Predicted upside: +23% Analyst reasoning: "Amazon appears most poised for growth due to investments in e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and satellites. As revenue scales, upward revisions to operating profit and FCF could outpace peers. We project operating margins of 11.3% in 2025E, 12.9% in 2026E, and 15.7% in 2027E, with potential upside if incremental revenue generation exceeds current forecasts." Ticker: APP Year-to-date performance: +108% Predicted upside: +13% Analyst reasoning: "Over the next 12-months, we expect APP to execute on a combination of demand and supply expansion initiatives that could improve the efficacy of Axon 2.0 and in-turn deliver estimate and multiple upsides." Ticker: MA Year-to-date performance: +8% Predicted upside: +21% Analyst reasoning: "Within the Payments, Processors, & FinTech sector, Mastercard provides diversified exposure across spend categories and benefits from robust growth in value-added services (~40% of business, high-teens growth). Key strengths include strong profitability (~55-70% EBIT margins, high FCF conversion), competitive moats, scalability, EPS resilience, GAAP-like EPS quality, and expansion into new flows (e.g., Mastercard Move)." Ticker: MRVL Year-to-date performance: -26% Predicted upside: +14% Analyst reasoning: "Marvell is well positioned to grow its Amazon custom ASIC revenue in '26, driven by Tranium2+ exceeding 1MM units next year." Ticker: SNOW Year-to-date performance: +42% Predicted upside: 27% Analyst reasoning: "We're Buy-rated on Snowflake shares, supported by tailwinds such as 1) rising customer focus on data migration and modernization driven by GenAI, 2) resilient AI and data spending amid macro uncertainty, and 3) growth from new products alongside stable core consumption, enabling high-20%/30% growth in FY26/CY25E (vs consensus at 27%)." Ticker: VRNS Year-to-date performance: +28% Predicted upside: +22% Analyst reasoning: "We rate Varonis shares as Buy, driven by 1) rising enterprise focus on data security, supported by AI adoption and dedicated budgets, 2) expected growth beyond conversions post-CY25 via expanded platform features and data store coverage (CY26 revs growth modeled at 21% vs Cons. 18%), and 3) increasing AI deployments enhancing demand for M365 Copilot security through its Microsoft partnership and other AI-driven SKUs." Ticker: BRZE Year-to-date performance: -31% Predicted upside: +43% Analyst reasoning: "We believe BRZE's shares are attractive at 4x CY26 revenue, trading at a discount to SMID apps peers at 11x despite superior growth prospects (20%+ vs. peers in high-teens). Sustained 20%+ revenue growth is supported by customer and partner field checks showing teens-plus spend growth." Jump to

September 29, 2025 10:44 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Autonomous Drones" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fast-evolving autonomous drone landscape, examining how advancements in AI, computer vision, and connectivity are propelling drones from risk-reduction tools into core infrastructure for industrial efficiency, safety, and business continuity. It explores how autonomy levels (L1-L5) are enabling zero-touch operations, swarm coordination, and AI-driven mission execution across diverse sectors. Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency, with industries adopting them as critical infrastructure rather than pilot projects. Mining operators are deploying drone-in-a-box ODAS platforms for safety and monitoring, energy firms are using AI-guided drones for real-time emissions detection, and retailers such as Walmart are scaling delivery fleets under supportive frameworks like the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration policy.Momentum is reinforced by investment and innovation. Anduril's funding expands defense autonomy, while Skydio's FAA-approved X10 dock enables fully remote inspections. Pioneers such as Maersk and Voliro are overcoming operational barriers. Patent activity is shifting toward GPS-denied navigation and hybrid aerial-ground drones, while deal values surged to $32.7B in H1 2025, reflecting strong confidence in autonomy-first ecosystems.The report examines sector-specific deployments across defense, mining, energy, retail, logistics, and industrial goods, alongside regulatory developments, market signals, and innovations shaping the next phase of drone autonomy.Autonomous drones are moving from risk reduction to driving operational efficiency. With mining companies deploying autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance system (ODAS) drone-in-a-box offerings and energy firms using AI-guided inspection drones, various industries are now entrusting critical safety and asset monitoring to autonomous drone fleets. This is improving efficiency and business continuity. AI and autonomy unlock new productivity frontiers. Innovators like Skydio, whose docked X10 drones are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved for fully remote, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) infrastructure inspections, and energy operators using real-time AI emission detectors, are proving how drone automation can replace manual monitoring with smarter, round-the-clock operations. Investment and hiring surge fuel the ecosystem's scale-up. Anduril raised $2.5 billion in funding in 2025 to expand autonomous defense platforms. This, combined with aggressive hiring from JD.com and Skydio around automation and analytics roles, illustrates how boardroom conviction and workforce expansion are powering rapid advances in autonomous drone platforms and accelerating their commercial rollout across sectors. New policies are unlocking larger-scale autonomous drone operations. With the creation of the FAA's BVLOS sandbox and China's real-name drone registration opening up airspace, firms like Walmart and Vodafone are now scaling autonomous delivery and inspection fleets, moving drone automation from controlled pilots into everyday, revenue-generating business models. Pioneers break through adoption barriers with real-world results. Companies such as Voliro in industrial inspections and Maersk in offshore asset monitoring are overcoming regulatory and operational hurdles through all-in-one autonomous systems and robust policy support, positioning autonomous drones as essential infrastructure for global enterprises.Key Highlights Scope Reasons to Buy Strategic Insights Technology Analysis Innovation Landscape Market Dynamics Sector-Specific Applications Competitive Intelligence Strategic Recommendations With autonomy now operational rather than aspirational, this report equips stakeholders with the intelligence needed to harness drones as a foundation for smarter, safer, and more resilient industries.Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/maas2o About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
