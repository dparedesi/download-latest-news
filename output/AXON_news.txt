We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The S&P 500 index surged past the 6,000-point milestone, setting fresh record highs, and small-cap stocks are poised for their best weekly performance since April 2024 as investor optimism surrounding the “Trump trade” continued to fuel a strong risk-on sentiment by the end of a wild week in the market. All major U.S. indices posted modest gains in midday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leading slightly, soaring beyond the 44,000-point mark. The blue-chip index is set for its best weekly performance in over a year. Friday's rise in the S&P 500 was powered by the utilities and real estate sectors, which had lagged post-election. Tech stocks took a breather following Thursday's rally. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 7%, pushing its weekly gains beyond 27% and propelling its market cap past $1 trillion. This move now places every "Magnificent Seven" tech stock in the trillion-dollar club, with the group's combined market cap topping $17 trillion. Treasury yields held steady, while the dollar strengthened in response to the Federal Reserve's Thursday 25-basis-point rate cut to 4.5%-4.75%. Gold softened, eyeing its worst week since late May, as both silver and oil dropped over 2% on the day. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) edged up 0.8%, extending its weekly gains to over 11%, marking its best week since July.

Title: AXON’s Sci-Fi Reality Machine: Visionary Leadership In Action
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwolcott/2024/11/08/axons-sci-fi-reality-machine-visionary-leadership-in-action/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T17:40:03Z
Full Content:
Tony Stark lives in Scottsdale—or at least his doppelganger: Rick Smith, founder and CEO of AXON, a $30 billion market cap leader in public safety technology markets. Few entrepreneurs deserve the “visionary” moniker more than Smith. From AXON’s founding in a garage in 1993, the company has grown from its original Taser products to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise with the purpose to “Protect Lives.” AXON Founder Rick Smith plays up the moon landing theme at the company's TASERCON2023 conference. Over the past five years alone, their shares have returned nearly 700%. AXON joined the S&P 500 in 2023. (FYI, I’m a shareowner.) I recently visited AXON to interview Smith and AXON’s president Josh Isner. (Video of our conversation here.) Smith and Isner represent a rare combination: a visionary leadership dyad. Think, Elon Musk and Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX, or Steve Jobs and Tim Cook at Apple. Smith brings the sci-fi. Isner and team create the reality. Arriving at AXON’s headquarters, you’ll enter through a peculiar portal—an oval-shaped stainless steel room managing access via facial recognition (or via their friendly receptionist, Laura Rodriquez). The lobby of AXON's headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, September 27, 2024, modeled after a similar ... [+] lobby in the film Men In Black— though the space suit is an AXON addition. AXON’s communications lead Alexandra Engel quipped with a smile, “Rick wanted an entrance like the one in Men In Black, so that’s what we got.” Catwalks crisscross the complex. That’s due to Smith’s observation that, “every great lightsaber fight happens on a catwalk.” It’s all part of AXON’s dynamic, discerning what customers might desire in the future and making it so. During its first decade, AXON (originally known as Taser) experienced exponential growth and significant growing pains. Smith recalls, “Early in my career I had Steve Jobs syndrome,” so he didn’t listen well to customers. After market-defining initial successes, “we had 2 or 3 contemporaneous failures.” AXON Founder Rick Smith and President Josh Isner join Professor Rob Wolcott at AXON's headquarters ... [+] for a conversation, September 27, 2024. Smith and Isner represent a "visionary leadership dyad," where complementary capabilities, vision and high trust combine to generate long-term outperformance. Smith realized he was part of the problem. "I’m really not good at hiring people [or] having hard conversations.” After Smith’s management epiphany, he started trusting others to run operations, freeing himself to live in the future. As Isner rose to lead sales and eventually to the chief operating role, Smith increasingly relied on him not only to manage the business, but also to challenge him. Isner “pushes back” when the superhero founder goes too far. “There’s this dynamic tension between the two of us, which is good.” Smith connects the dots between customers and AXON’s product development team, while Isner runs the business. Smith muses, “If he weren’t doing this, Josh would probably be Bill Belichick,” referencing one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time. AXON President Josh Isner (center foreground) rallies colleagues at AXON Fest 2024, the company's ... [+] annual leadership confab. Other visionary entrepreneurs faced similar journeys. After founding Dell in his dorm room, Michael Dell eventually learned to rely on exceptional managers like Kevin Rollins to transform the company from a scrappy challenger to industry-leading enterprise. Visionary leadership dyads work when two individuals combine complementary capabilities, vision and high trust to generate long-term outperformance. No matter how compelling the ideas emanating from the C-suite, Smith asserts, “creativity is a team sport.” One of the ways AXON inspires and focuses its teams’ creativity is an approach I call reframing: reframing challenges and asking better questions. Early on, the company focused on making better tasers. That’s great, but not enough to lead the future. Smith admonished, “Our job is not just to sell the next version of taser. How do we make the bullet obsolete? I challenge you guys to give me a weapon that outperforms a bullet in stopping power.” As a result, they started discovering far more innovative answers and offerings. AXON Founder Rick Smith makes a point during an interview with the author and AXON's President Josh ... [+] Isner. Unlike most companies, AXON doesn’t allow its current capabilities and products to define its boundaries. AXON’s vision is bounded by possible future customer needs, rather than by AXON’s current businesses, or even by what customers say they want. AXON’s team listens intently, but also scans horizons. Customers rarely ask for breakthroughs. AXON Skydio drone control and monitoring systems. After partnering with Skydio in the marketplace, ... [+] AXON acquired the company in 2024. In a 2017 future concept video, AXON envisioned a rapid-responsive future of policing. For instance, the video proposed AI-powered completion of police reports from bodycam data—not possible at the time. In April 2024, AXON made it real with the launch of Draft One. Imagine the hours officers can now reallocate to achieving their missions. Starting in the 2010s, AXON closely monitored advancements in drones. In 2018 they launched AXON Air with external partners. Later in 2024, the company acquired two of those drone company partners, Sky-Hero and Dedrone. AXON cultivated partnerships and expertise, building optionality and offerings before the competition. An officer operates an AXON-enabled drone in the field. AXON’s strategy reflects the essence of what my co-author Kaihan Krippendorff and I term Proximity in our recent book by the same name. Proximity observes that digital technologies compel value creation ever closer to the moment of demand. I first started sharing Proximity on Forbes in 2017. AXON brings more and more capabilities closer to the moment of need for public safety professionals. Drones for situational awareness and rapid response, AI-completed police reports, virtual reality for training—anything, anywhere, anytime. That’s quintessential Proximity, and it’s winning. Smith offers a provocative perspective on the ethics of technology and public safety. Reflecting on the 2002 film Minority Report, he challenges conventional wisdom. Many people interpret the film as posing a dystopic future. “They had a technology that took murders to zero in a violent country, took false convictions to zero.” Smith counters that logic. One person gets framed and that invalidates the entire system? “To me, that is an unimaginably crazy good system.” Tom Cruise runs in a scene from the film 'Minority Report', 2002. (Photo by 20th Century-Fox/Getty ... [+] Images) The AXON team engages across the public safety community in rigorous ethical dialogues, which evolve as technologies and threats change. Technologies like predictive AI must operate within accountable systems designed to minimize bias and uphold individual rights. Advancing public safety while maintaining public trust will be essential to ensure communities feel both protected and respected. AXON’s commitment to public safety and technological innovation finds its most ambitious expression in “Moonshot 2032.” AXON’s initiative endeavors to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% over a decade. AXON’s moonshot motivates continuous exploration of public safety challenges, addressed with the latest technologies, equipping public safety agencies to respond faster and more effectively while simultaneously protecting lives. Smith at AXON's Moonshot 2032 launch event in 2022. Smith’s vision for AXON’s future remains bold and cinematic. The company’s stunning new headquarters under development amps the sci-fi theme: more catwalks and a platform reminiscent of the scene from The Empire Strikes Back, where Luke Skywalker discovers his father. Rather than becoming the Evil Empire, Smith aspires for AXON to remain the rebel force. “I’m terrified. I want to continue to be the disruptor—and not the disrupted. Meanwhile, life is better with lightsabers. AXON's 2022 launch event for their Moonshot 2032: Cut gun-related deaths between police and the ... [+] public by 50% in 10 years. The Moonshot manifests AXON's purpose and inspires AXON team members and partners to pursue meaningful positive change.

Investing.com -- It's no secret that stock investors have been bagging juicy gains in November, pushed mainly by the market pricing in a second Trump mandate, the end of election uncertainty, and a persistently dovish Fed. But while virtually all bulls are getting their fair share of profits, the magnitude of these gains will vary wildly. That's where ProPicks AI users are leading the pack. In fact, only in the first week of November, they garnished an eye-popping 35%+ gain on three stocks. To wit: Now, honestly, what was the last time you bagged results like that without the help of advanced machine-learning-powered stock-picking models? I sure haven't. But there's no need to worry; there's still time to get all our picks for November with up to 55% using this link, as part of our exclusive Early Bird Black Friday sale. Already a Pro user? Make sure you've seen this month's list! On top of these rallies, our users are also getting big bucks on several earnings season winners. In fact, just to talk about today, they are already up 15.2% on Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), which has just crushed earnings and forward guidance. But how do we do it? Is it some sort of 'AI magic?' Of course not. ProPicks AI works because it offers a simple, industry-recognized approach to fundamental analysis by using extensive sets of data big data modeling. By comparing all stocks in the market at a glance, it manages to surface several hidden gems with investment-grade precision, thus improving returns and helping lower risks. That's how, unlike other models, our AI identifies undervalued names before they become too expensive. Instead of relying solely on momentum models, our approach integrates decades of comprehensive stock market fundamental and technical data, channeling a multitude of data sets to provide out premium users with market-beating stock strategies. In fact, our backtest suggests that going for the long run will give you even heftier gains. See chart below for reference: Source: ProPicks This means a $100K principal in our strategy would have turned into an eye-popping $1,848,800K by now. So, will you risk going another month without the super-human power of AI data processing? For less than $9 a month, that decision has never been easier.

The rupee declined 6 paise to close at a fresh lifetime low of 84.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Thursday, as weak domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows dented market sentiment. Forex traders said investors were also cautious ahead of the US Fed meeting outcome. Moreover, overnight gains in crude oil prices also weighed on the local unit. However, a correction in the dollar index against major currencies helped the rupee and restrained the slide, they added.

The Nifty opened within the range of the previous day, and has slid since after an attempt to build on yesterday’s advance. For the day, support near 24,400 will be key. This is because any close under this level will create a “bearish dark cloud cover”. If the decline worsens, then participants will be watching yesterday’s open 24,309 closely - if the market ends below this marker it will create the more powerful “bearish engulfing”. For the last few days, 24,500 has served as resistance and will continue to be the critical upside hurdle going forward. On the downside, 24,309 and 24,204 will be key levels to watch. Niva Bupa Health Insurance Company IPO has been subscribed 0.54 times as of 2.27 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 0.78 times, NII 0.03 times, and retail 0.56 times. The issue closes on November 11, 2024. Almost 50% valuation compared to Zomato gives some comfort although it should not be considered as an arbitrage in valuation. If Swiggy’s EBITDA catches up to 3-4% in the food delivery business, which is currently at 1% and Average Order Value (AOV) improves to Rs. 550-600 levels in quick commerce with higher non-grocery share, we can see bridging in the valuation gap. Although, this should not be expected in near term. ​Sagility India IPO​ has been subscribed 2.32 times as of 2.18 pm on November 7, 2024. QIB portion has been subscribed 2.65 times, NII 0.93 times, retail 3.42 times, and those reserved for employees 3.26 times. The issue closes today. Brokerage Motilal Oswal recognised that Swiggy pioneered the hyperlocal commerce industry in India, launching food delivery in 2014 and quick commerce in 2020, and is well-recognised as a leader in innovation. Swiggy operates in an oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Motilal analysts remarked that the food delivery platform’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering.

The decisive win by Trump of the US mandate, stronger than expected, the probability of easing of tensions in the middle east is now a high possibility. At the same time, his statements over the next few weeks could put some cats amongst the pigeons as he makes noises on China, Russia, Oil and of course, renewables. With the USD gaining strength, Gold – being inversely related, is bound to fall and therefore the Fed meeting today holds great importance as to the future direction of bonds and the dollar. On the one hand the pre election rhetoric points to yields hardening in the US, growth and incremental data is unlikely to change the trajectory that the central banks wish to take and will act as a counter. Hence a bit of bumpiness is expected in the next 2-3 weeks and maybe right upto the President elect assuming office in January. Gold as of now remains on an uptrend but like we have been saying, tight stops are necessary especially if the pivots around USD 2600 are challenged as that would mark a significant break. Till then, its anticipated that the initial kneejerk reaction on the USD may reverse esp if President Trump talks around higher deficits that could put pressure on the USD. “ Driven by tractor and automobile sales, Mahindra & Mahindra is expected to report strong revenue growth in Q2.
