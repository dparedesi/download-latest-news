Shares of Confluent (CFLT) surged Monday morning after IBM (IBM) announced a deal to acquire the software maker for $31 per share, valuing Confluent at $11 billion. Confluent's software helps companies manage and organize large amounts of data, an in-demand service as many companies are looking to manage massive data sets that are used in the training and running of artificial intelligence models. IBM said that Confluent "excels at preparing data for AI, keeping it clean and connected across systems and applications, eliminating silos inherent in agentic AI." IBM said that the company's total addressable market has doubled in the last four years to $100 billion. IBM will acquire Confluent with cash on hand, and said it expects the deal to close by the middle of next year as Confluent's largest shareholders, which control about 62% of the stock's voting power, have agreed to vote in favor of the deal. Confluent shares were up 29% in midday trading Monday. Coming into the week, the stock had lost 17% of its value since the start of the year. The stock of a company being acquired typically surges as investors look to buy in below the announced deal price, $31 per share in Confluent's case. The news of the IBM deal sent Confluent's share price into positive territory for 2025. IBM shares were up 1.5%, boosting the stock's year-to-date gain to 42%. IBM is among the top performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025, trailing only heavy machinery maker Caterpillar (CAT) and investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS). The deal could be a boost for IBM's software business, which it could use as slowing sales growth in its hybrid cloud segment disappointed investors in its latest earnings report in October. Wedbush analysts said following the announcement that they "believe this acquisition represents a strong move by IBM to continue adding more data processing capabilities to its hybrid cloud ecosystem while driving profitable growth over time." The analysts added that Confluent is "a natural fit for IBM’s long-term growth strategy as the company addresses IBM’s focus on eliminating data silos for powering AI," and said they "loudly applaud" what they expect will be one of more acquisitions to come. The Wall Street Journal had reported late Sunday that the sides were close to a deal. Reports emerged in October that Confluent was considering a sale and working with a bank to sort through its options, from private equity firms to tech companies.
