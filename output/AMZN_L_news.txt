Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye As in his first term, Donald Trump now presides over a visibly sinking ship as his approval ratings slide. MAGA, a movement built around the personality of one man, never amounted to a coherent political force or even a workable coalition. Claims that Trump and his lieutenants won a mandate in 2024 and then ‘saved’ the country were always delusional. After all, his margin was thin, as was that of his party in Congress. Three forces are killing MAGA, perhaps even pushing the US in a distinctly socialist direction. The first are the internal divisions, which are growing ever-more pronounced and will only intensify as an aging Trump becomes an ever-lamer duck, particularly if Democrats romp to victory again in the 2026 midterms. The second, arguably more serious, weakness lies in the loss of the Latino vote – a growing political force in many states. Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President. Unfortunately, there's a good chance a Democrat President will be taking credit for those jobs. 1 posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye There isn’t going to be any 2026 Mid-term!

That is always what makes or breaks a president. In his first term, he did and set the stage for 8 years of growth. I know he has a lot going on but now its time to focus on the economy and pass a Reagan like growth package.

New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Brooke Rollins found 5,000 DEAD PEOPLE getting SNAP, and 500,000 PEOPLE getting SNAP "2 times under the same name." https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1988766862994289135?t=ybYUf1Xf3sQWgZawtM_NJQ&s=19 https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1988766862994289135?t=ybYUf1Xf3sQWgZawtM_NJQ&s=19 Health Care is just one issue...Now they have a month less to try to figure out a solution. No barf alert? The article is bird cage liner. Odd year elections always favor democrats Why are you listening to some loser liberal spout BS? That’s the most massive battle axe ever and yet he’s wielding it with one hand. His left hand too. No they don't. Oh ok two hands. But it’s still huge. BS? The huge shift in the Hispanic vote to the Democrats last week is real. It’s the single biggest reason that the races that were thought to be competitive turned into routs. “We got him this time” - same old song and dance. In the meantime, streets of Chicago, DC, Portland are slowly being cleaned up, illegals are being deported or are removing themselves, Iran’s nuclear program has been set back 10 years, and peace is knocking at the door in the Middle East. What is the unemployment rate right now? What is the inflation rate? What is the interest rate? Show the stats, not some libtarded rendition of what they want to be the truth. I’m sticking with Trump and against these quisling RINOs that can’t figure out which side to butter their own toast.

Title: Don't Chase Google, Meta: IBM Chief Scientist Urges Graduates To Examine Sectors Outside Silicon Valley

IBM Chief Scientist Ruchir Puri urged tech graduates to explore avenues beyond chasing after the prestige of Silicon Valley tech giants such as Google, Meta or Microsoft. He encouraged them to instead look into those sectors and industries where they find potential for innovation, in light of the turbulence in the job market primarily stemming from AI. "Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after," Puri said, indicating that software engineers have niches they can thrive in beyond large tech companies. "Artificial intelligence is transforming every sector — from agriculture to retail — and meaningful work is happening everywhere," he said in an interview with Business Today. Puri used the example of agricultural manufacturing company John Deere which have used AI and automation to optimise its operations in innovative ways. The firm has pioneered ecofriendly and economical ways to engage in weeding, such as the 'spot and spray' method, where cameras and AI are used to find and target individual weeds, helping farmer cut costs and reduce damage to crops. “Graduates often overlook such enterprises while focusing narrowly on Silicon Valley,” Puri said. He asked freshers to see beyond "a narrow set of tech companies" and to look to the "massive enterprise landscape". His comments can also be contextualised with the increasing number of lay-offs and lower job demand in tech companies with the advent of AI automation. Job postings reduced 16% year-over-year, according to an August report from Handshake, at the same time, applications per posting went up 26% showing the gap between demand and supply. Tech conglomerates such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Amazon have announced waves of layoffs in 2025. IBM also stated earlier in the month that it would get rid of thousands of positions across the globe in the fourth quarter. However the firm also said that its planning to ramp up hiring young graduates for AI-centred positions, according statements chief executive officer Arvidn Krishna made to CNN in an interview. “People are talking about layoffs or hiring freezes, but I actually want to say we are the opposite,” Krishna said. “We expect to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in recent years," he added.

Title: As industry layoffs become the ‘new normal’, so does fear of AI’s impact on adland’s job market

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Job cuts made at Brandtech group media agency Jellyfish may be the latest symptom of a contracting advertising and marketing job market. The company cut as many as 50 roles at the end of October, following a slowdown in client spending, Digiday has learned. “Our existing clients were spending less money, some of those were retracting the projects that they had planned, and that obviously led to a revenue hit,” said one exec whose role was cut in the layoffs and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jellyfish confirmed the cuts. “Like everyone in marketing, our business is dynamic and we are constantly making shifts in our resources, redesigning roles and structures,” said a spokesperson. “At 8% we have one of the lowest churn rates in the industry. Currently there is a very small number of roles affected in the U.S. and U.K.” Those let go face difficult circumstances. One ad-tech executive made redundant earlier this year, who exchanged candor for anonymity, told Digiday that 11 months on, they were still without a permanent position. Compared with previous job markets, they said new positions were thinner on the ground. “Back then I could walk out of a job and walk into five interviews the following day. Now, I can’t get the interview,” they said. “It’s a tough market.” Jellyfish’s cuts are small, compared with the job losses at holding company agencies in recent months. Forrester analysis suggests agency headcounts have fallen 8% in 2025. In August, Dentsu committed to eliminating 3,400 jobs worldwide, approximately 8% of its staff. WPP, meanwhile, cut 7,000 during the final months of Mark Read’s CEO tenure; 700 came from Ogilvy alone. Interpublic Group has laid off 3,200 employees this year, while its to-be acquirer Omnicom already cut its global headcount by 3,000 jobs in 2024 and has been working to reduce staff costs by 10% in the run-up to that merger’s completion. Once the deal is complete, it expects to find $750 million in cost savings — given labor costs always lead the balance sheet, that’s not great news for the thousands working under each umbrella. “Layoffs have become the new normal,” said the former Jellyfish exec. But industry job losses aren’t limited to agencies. In October, TikTok cut 400 jobs in the U.K. from its Trust and Safety Team, while Target cut 1,800 white-collar positions, and Amazon recently announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 roles. CPG giant Nestlé plans to cut 12,000 office staff. Between August and December 2024 (the most recent data), the American ad industry lost 4,600 roles overall according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And data from Britain’s Office for National Statistics showed job openings in the advertising and marketing industries had fallen 7.5% between 2022 and 2025. That’s set against rising unemployment in the U.S. (4.3% in August) and the U.K. (5% in September); U.S. firms, particularly retailers, announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some of the firms responsible have laid out their own justifications for reducing headcount. A historic merger here; long-term underperformance there; a restructuring ahead of a potential sale. Add them all together, and a pattern emerges. “What we’re seeing is layoffs as a result of restructuring and financial distress,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, who referenced an estimate by Madison & Wall that suggested the four largest holdcos averaged just 0.3% organic growth in Q3, the lowest for five years. “If you’ve got a category that is in effect growing less than 1% then yes, they’re shedding jobs, because jobs are the number one overhead,” he added. This year’s job cuts can be traced to restructuring and client cutbacks. But generative AI is the ghost at the leaving party. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” said Beth Galetti, svp of people experience and technology at Amazon, in an Oct. 28 blog post sent to Amazon employees. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Naveen Tewari, CEO of ad tech firm InMobi, warned in February that AI progress meant his software engineers “will not have jobs within two years.” Statements like Tewari’s are leaving marketing execs looking for their next role worried they’re going to be frozen out, experience be damned. The anonymous ad tech exec voiced fears that older workers could be disproportionately affected, and that a perception they’re less adept with gen AI tools could be used as cover for ageist discrimination. 40% of advertising staffers aged between 40 and 55 feel their age has limited their career, according to research by the IPA and the Advertising Association. “It does start to feel like ageism and a slight white male-ism,” they said. Pattisall suggested that while this year’s layoffs can be primarily traced to restructuring pushes, next year’s will be provoked by AI. Two years ago, Forrester predicted that AI, automation and efficiency initiatives would result in a net 7.5% reduction in the U.S. advertising workforce. Its most recent report upgraded that estimate to 15% by the end of next year. Again, this isn’t limited to ad agencies. Over a quarter of private-sector employers expect to cut staff as a result of AI, according to a survey of 2,000 firms by the Chartered Institue of Personnel and Development, the U.K. professional body for HR. 62% said they believed that admin and managerial roles were most at risk. “The technology was nascent when we developed that forecast in in mid-2023,” explained Pattisall. “We had not factored for agentic and agents. I think we’ll see a larger percentage of the advertising population that can be replaced by those tools.” — Jessica Davies contributed reporting to this story Walmart’s website says its meal costs 25% less than the basket it offered last year, and that the turkey was at the lowest price since 2019. Google is pushing Demand Gen and YouTube to ad partners, hedging against the inevitable erosion of its search business by AI chatbots. The arrival of the Agentic RTB Framework this week lands as this week lands as the third agentic standard in under a month.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

by Michael Snyder | Nov 12, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second-lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: In America’s K-Shaped Economy, The Rich Are Getting Richer While Almost Everyone Else Is Getting The Sharp End Of The Stick

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Pundits have been talking a lot about America’s “K-shaped economy” lately, but most average people on the street have no idea what that means. Basically, it means that the wealthy are getting even wealthier while almost everyone else is getting monkey-hammered. Yesterday, I detailed 11 signs that economic conditions in the U.S. are the worst that they have been since the Great Recession, but if you have plenty of money you may feel like everything is just great right now. For those at the top of the economic pyramid, it could be argued that these are the best of times because the stock market has been soaring. But for many of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, it literally feels like we are in the midst of a horrifying economic crisis. At a time when the cost of living is crushing most of the population, debt levels are exploding, and mass layoffs are happening all over the nation, we continue to see “strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans”… Experts describe the current U.S. economy as “K-shaped,” a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the “K” represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans. By contrast, the letter’s lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs. The top 10 percent of all income earners have always spent more money than everyone else. But now the proportion of consumer spending that they are accounting for has reached the highest level ever recorded… These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi. “That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it’s ever been in the data,” he told CBS News. If you are thriving in this very difficult economic environment, that is a good thing. However, you should also be aware that most people are really struggling, and that is especially true for low-income Americans. In fact, the percentage of subprime borrowers that are “at least 60 days past due on their auto loans” just shot up to the highest level we have ever seen… More Americans than ever are falling behind on their car payments. The share of subprime borrowers at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest in data going back to 1994, according to Fitch Ratings. With ongoing inflation pressures and the return of student loan bills, millions of car owners are struggling to afford their monthly payments. It’s the latest sign of weakness in the US economy as the Federal Reserve considers the path of future rate cuts. We never even got a number this bad during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. As a result, vehicle repossessions are absolutely soaring. This is the economic reality that most of us are living in. According to one recent survey, 55 percent of American workers are concerned that they could soon lose their jobs… Some 55% of employed Americans say they’re concerned about losing their jobs, according to a recent Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That angst follows a drumbeat of layoff announcements by major employers, including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. calculated the most job cut announcements for any October in more than two decades. It comes layered on top of households’ exasperation over the cost of living. A 62% majority in the Oct. 23-25 poll said the cost of their everyday items had climbed over the last month and nearly half of those people said the increases have been difficult to afford. In previous recessions, low paid workers got laid off in very high numbers. This time around, it is highly paid workers that are getting hit particularly hard. Even highly successful tech companies such as Amazon are eliminating good paying jobs… Amazon is laying off almost 700 corporate workers based in New York City as part of the company’s nearly 14,000 corporate layoffs. The layoffs, which were first reported by Crain’s New York, were disclosed in a filing with the New York State Department of Labor. In total, 660 employees are being laid off by Amazon across nine offices in New York City. Among them, the largest layoffs affect Amazon’s Manhattan West office and its New York Tech Hub, also based in Manhattan. It appears that the employment market is really starting to deteriorate. And the most recent weekly report from ADP seems to confirm this… Recent announcements of large layoffs at a few prominent companies have raised concerns that the labor market could be weakening further, and today’s new weekly ADP employment report confirms that fear. The ADP weekly jobless report pointed to a deterioration in US labor momentum, stating that “for the four weeks ending Oct. 25, 2025, private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs a week, suggesting that the labor market struggled to produce jobs consistently during the second half of the month.” Added together that is 45,000 job losses in the month (not including government workers), which would be the largest monthly drop in jobs since March 2023… But if you have lots of cash in the bank and you are not concerned about the security of your job, you might be feeling pretty good right about now. As Peter Atwater has aptly noted, those that are sitting at the top are “spending like there’s no tomorrow”… Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts, said that the biggest division is America is not on the left and right, it’s up and down between those at the top and bottom of the US economy. For those at the top, the economy looks good and they are ‘spending like there’s no tomorrow.’ But Atwater says Americans on the bottom are already facing recession conditions, as people struggle with affordability. Of course the prosperity that high earners are currently experiencing is just temporary. Anyone that thinks that this stock market bubble is sustainable is simply not being rational. Key ratios were not even this out of whack during the most euphoric days of the Dotcom bubble. What goes up must come down. But for now the wealthy are living the high life while most of the rest of us really struggle to make ends meet from month to month.

Leaving a steady role at a company like American Express to start your own AI consulting firm sounds glamorous… until you realize just how much grit it takes to turn that vision into revenue. In a recent episode of Productside Stories, I sat down with Cooper Craig, a former product manager who traded enterprise decks for small-business deals and built a thriving AI agency from the ground up. His story (and his scars) reveal what it really takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur in 2025’s AI-charged economy. The timing isn’t accidental. 2025 has seen a wave of experienced product managers exploring entrepreneurship. Some are leaving big tech; others are launching AI automation consultancies, productized services, or indie SaaS tools. What’s driving the shift? Cooper’s journey from product manager to entrepreneur captures all three forces colliding at once. After being laid off from Amex in 2024, he found himself doing gig work to stay afloat — until he decided to build something of his own: Smartify AI, a consulting agency helping small and mid-sized businesses automate workflows and customer engagement with AI tools. What surprised Cooper most wasn’t the leap into entrepreneurship. It was how prepared he already was. “My product background is definitely my secret sauce,” he explained. “When a client comes to me saying, ‘I want AI to do this, this, and that,’ I can see through the noise. I know how to frame a problem, validate it, and build iteratively instead of over-engineering.” Every skill that makes PMs effective in organizations (discovery, prioritization, customer empathy, hypothesis testing) becomes an unfair advantage when building your own business. That combination is exactly what makes going from product manager to entrepreneur not just possible, but powerful. Cooper’s story isn’t a LinkedIn success reel. It’s a crash course in humility. When he was first laid off, he admits, “I felt like a failure. I’d been a PM for nearly 10 years and suddenly I was driving Uber to make ends meet.” That raw honesty resonated with product leaders everywhere. The truth is, the from product manager to entrepreneur journey almost always starts with uncertainty, not funding. Many PMs are wired for systems and predictability; entrepreneurship is the opposite. Cooper leaned on what PMs do best: structured learning. He spent a month immersing himself in no-code tools like Make.com and n8n, experimenting with automation workflows, voice agents, and AI assistants. Then, he landed his first client, a startup building the “GolfNow of pickleball.” From there, referrals snowballed. His key lesson? Momentum compounds faster than confidence. Build something small, ship it, and let outcomes rebuild belief. Ask any founder and they’ll tell you, getting clients is one thing, keeping up with them is another. Even after Smartify AI crossed $30K MRR, Cooper found himself trapped in the classic founder paradox: “I needed to hire help to grow, but I couldn’t hire until I grew.” The grind of going from product manager to entrepreneur often comes down to managing three overlapping systems: This is where experienced PMs have an edge. We know how to systematize, prioritize, and measure what matters. But make no mistake: founder life replaces Jira tickets with invoices, and stakeholder meetings with late-night problem-solving. Once you’ve survived the first year, something shifts. The same frameworks PMs use to guide product growth now guide business growth. Cooper uses his own version of a product roadmap to track his company’s milestones. Weekly sprints? Still there. Retrospectives? Absolutely. Only now, the “users” are clients, the “features” are services, and the “product” is the business itself. As AI consulting matures, he’s turning Smartify AI’s internal playbooks (like his VoiceMail Pro voice agent) into standalone products. That’s where the from product manager to entrepreneur evolution comes full circle: from managing someone else’s roadmap to owning your own. And for product leaders reading this, that’s the deeper takeaway: you already have the mindset, frameworks, and rigor of a founder. What you might lack is permission to start. If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur, Cooper’s advice is deceptively simple: Join our newsletter and stay up to date with all things current and Product Management related. © 2025 Productside.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. AI continues to ripple through the corporate world, with bosses eager to boost productivity and workers equally eager for tools that make their jobs easier. But as many AI pilots flop, the demand for employees who can actually apply the technology effectively has never been higher. That’s why Cisco is leaning on its workforce rather than cutting it. Unlike peers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture—who have trimmed staff—Cisco is investing in skilling up the employees it already has. “I don’t want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,” CEO Chuck Robbins said to CNBC in August. “I don’t want to get rid of engineers. I just want our engineers we have today to innovate faster and be more productive.” In practice, that’s meant in part giving developers access to AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. Already, about 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log in to AI coding tools at least once a month, and nearly a quarter of the company’s code is AI-generated—up from just 4% a year ago, according to Fletcher Previn, Cisco’s chief information officer. Internally, Cisco leaders are expected to pursue AI learning, in part because employees whose managers use AI are twice as likely to adopt it themselves, Scott McGuckin, Cisco’s global head of talent acquisition, told Fortune. And for those who do embrace the technology, the benefits are obvious. “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company,” McGuckin said. “Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” While tech companies are expected to slow their hiring as AI makes existing roles more productive, McGuckin said the war for talent remains competitive—and AI adoption is a top market differentiator. “For technical hires today, we look for relevant coding and engineering skills, which vary. Some of our coveted AI skill sets lie in AI and machine learning foundations and data science. Having these hard skills are a baseline to most applied roles,” he added. When push comes to shove, what really moves the needle in the hiring process is showing knowledge of AI in context, like responsible AI, ethics in bias detection, and explainability, McGuckin said. But for entry-level talent, that doesn’t mean you even need a degree. Demonstrating skills through coursework, research, or independent projects is often enough. In fiscal year 2023, 30% of Cisco’s entry-level hires were degreeless—something the company plans to expand upon. Cisco’s efforts are part of an industrywide movement to upskill workers for the AI era. In a recent report from the AI Workforce Consortium—led by Cisco and joined by Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP—it was found that seven out of 10 of the fastest-growing information and communications technology jobs were AI-related. The group also published a catalog of nearly 250 learning recommendations and an AI skills glossary to help workers navigate how to stay competitive in their field. Still, AI’s arrival hasn’t been without headaches. The hiring process has been infiltrated by fake candidates, often tied to North Korea. One report found that the number of companies that hired North Korean software developers grew a staggering 220% in the past year. Broadly speaking, McGuckin said Cisco has made vigilance a priority, increasing verification steps during the hiring process, including enhanced background checks that may involve an in-person component. “We want to assure all our applicants that there’s nothing they need to do differently when applying through Cisco’s talent portal—they are not losing out to fake candidates,” he said. “We feel the onus is on us, or employers at large, to create a safe and trustworthy candidate experience.” For Cisco, the challenge is straightforward: keep pace with AI’s rapid acceleration while making sure the people building it are both skilled—and real. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. IBM's chief scientist has advice for recent grads hoping to land a software engineering job: Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after. "Don't just go for the standard 'I'm going to go and work for Google, Microsoft, IBM,'" Ruchir Puri told Business Insider. Puri, who has spent over three decades at IBM, said that as AI reshapes every industry, software engineers are needed across all sectors — whether that's transportation, manufacturing, or retail. He said job seekers should widen their search "beyond a narrow set of technology companies" and also consider the "massive enterprise landscape." For example, a company like John Deere, the world's largest agricultural equipment manufacturer, may not be top of mind for a software engineer looking for a job. However, Puri said the company is a household name, making a measurable impact. Other similar companies are hiring software engineers to help drive industry transformation, and being a part of that work can feel fulfilling, he said. "You are impacting something that is fundamental to global economy — and it's not just about technology," Puri said. Puri's comments come as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said in a CNBC interview that the company planned to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. However, new graduates are generally entering a challenging market. An August Handshake report found that job postings on the platform decreased by over 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, competition soared, with the average number of applications per job up by 26% year-over-year. Software engineering in general has undergone a shake-up in recent years. A saturated talent pool paired with rapid AI adoption has created an environment of uncertainty in hiring. While the tech industry is investing heavily in AI development, companies in the sector have also conducted consistent layoffs over the past few years. Giants like Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon all made cuts in 2025. Earlier this month, IBM announced it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter, impacting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce," a spokesperson told Business Insider. Krishna said in the CNBC interview that the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. Puri said that now is a good time for entry-level candidates to expand their view when it comes to finding meaningful work. "The world is your oyster," Puri said. "There are lots of companies in the world. All of them are looking to transform themselves with AI." Are you struggling to find a software engineering job? We want to hear from you.

Title: The difficulty of tracking and interpreting AI usage labels

Full Content:
by Tom Johnson on Nov 12, 2025 comments categories: ai Tracking and communicating AI usage in docs turns out to be not only challenging technically, but also potentially full of interpretive pitfalls. There seems to be a double-edged sword at work. On the one hand, we want to track the degree to which AI is being used in doc work so we can quantify, measure, and evaluate the impact of AI. On the other hand, if a tech writer calls out that they used AI for a documentation changelist, it might falsely create the impression that AI did all the work, reducing the value of including the human at all. In this post, I'll explore these dilemmas. Reasons to track AI usage Identifying AI-written content improves the review Problems with identifying AI usage AI fluency is an underrated skill Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail Conclusion Works Cited Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. Reasons to track AI usage First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. Identifying AI-written content improves the review There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Problems with identifying AI usage Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: Because this changelist has an AI-generated label, I assume AI created the content. If AI is creating this content, why am I paying a tech writer here? I should instead be buying more AI chips. Conclusion: Let’s reroute the money to AI chips instead of tech writer salaries. This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. AI fluency is an underrated skill Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Conclusion Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.

Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio.

How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories.

Title: Amazon cuts 700 jobs in NYC alone on quest to streamline by slashing 30,000 positions
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/11/business/amazons-massive-layoffs-include-nearly-700-terminations-in-nyc-state-department-of-labor/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T23:48:58Z

Amazon’s massive October layoffs included 660 terminations in Manhattan, according to New York State government records. The ax fell on nine office addresses affecting corporate employees only, Amazon confirmed. Two sites bore the brunt of the local cuts. The e-commerce giant’s 450 W. 33rd St. offices near Hudson Yards were hit with 233 layoffs, while its 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship — which Amazon bought in 2020 for $1 billion — saw 182 terminations, according to Monday filings from the state Department of Labor. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and [the] AI revolution in motion.” Amazon declined to share details of the cuts but said warehouse and delivery workers weren’t among those laid off. Late last month, the Seattle-based tech titan said it was eliminating 14,000 staffers as part of restructuring. The move was aimed at “reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” wrote Beth Galetti, senior VP of people experience in a blog post on Oct. 28. The company is reportedly planning to slash a total of 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of cuts – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce, sources told Reuters. The layoffs are expected to continue in January, after the holiday shopping season, according to a New York Times report. Amazon has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since Andy Jassy took over the helm from the company’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, in 2021. Amazon typically employs thousands of workers at its locations and none of the nine offices that saw layoffs in New York City is expected to close. As of 2023, Amazon employed 2,000 people inside the grand old Lord & Taylor building where the tech company established its “New York Tech Hub.” The 11-story, Italian Renaissance Revival tower boasts a landscaped rooftop with trees, an indoor dining area and even a dog run. Amazon’s recent New York City layoffs include 91 jobs at 410 Tenth Ave, 58 positions at 7 W. 34th St., 41 jobs at 330 W. 34th St., 38 jobs at 237 Park Ave., nine jobs at 315 Park Ave. S, seven at 215 Park Ave. S. and one unlucky person at 6 W. 35th St., according to public records. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti wrote last month. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Advertisement

Title: Paramount Stock Jumps Over 9% After First Earnings Post-Skydance Deal
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-stock-jumps-q3-2025-earnings-reaction/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T19:40:24Z
Full Content:
Despite the media giant’s “promising start,” analysts warned its turnaround would take a “significant amount of time” Paramount shares jumped more than 9% on Tuesday after the media giant posted its first earnings since the closing of Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition. During the quarter, Paramount swung to a loss of $257 million and revenue growth was flat at $6.7 billion, weighed down by declines in linear advertising and affiliate fees. The results included a $13 million loss and $4.12 billion in revenue under its new owner Skydance and a $244 million loss and $2.58 billion in revenue under the media giant’s previous leadership. But it also saw strong growth in streaming, adding 1.4 million subscribers for a total of 79.1 million globally, and raised its cost savings target to at least $3 billion, up from its previous target of $2 billion. Paramount stock is up 42% in the past year, year to date and the past six months, but is down 2% in the past month. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said that Paramount has the potential to be a “dynamic global media company.” But she warned there are “no easy fixes” and that the company’s turnaround will take “a significant amount of time” and “require substantial investment and investor patience.” “It is clear PSKY has a very strong management team and there will be upward estimate revisions post results,” Ehrlich wrote. “However, there are still many unknowns on the strategic initiatives the company has undertaken and, as evidenced by prior large combinations, restructurings often take years to implement.” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman agreed that Paramount is off to a “promising start,” but acknowledged questions remain about the path ahead, including how Skydance will identify additional cost savings without constraining growth and how much money is needed for its streaming business to “truly compete with the likes of Netflix, Disney and Amazon — all of which hold a considerable lead in global scale, content output and engagement.” “Our broader questions now center on the trajectory required to achieve these longer-term goals — and how they may evolve alongside changes in the company’s spending allocation and potential structural shifts within its portfolio,” Fishman said. “More specifically, we continue to believe that a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery remains a logical next step for the company, one that could meaningfully alter its current trajectory.” Paramount has submitted three separate bids to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, which ranged between $19 and $23.50 per share, and were rejected for being too low. When asked about WBD and its M&A strategy in general, Paramount CEO David Ellison that there are “no must-haves.” “We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” he explained. “We believe we can achieve our goals with our creative content engines, we believe we can achieve our streaming goals and that we can drive enterprise efficiency and create value and long term free cash flow generation all through the building standpoint.” “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long term disciplined owner operators,” Ellison added. “So from that standpoint, we’ll always approach things through the lens of how do we maximize value for shareholders.” In the absence of a combination with WBD, Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris said the company is running a very similar playbook to Warner post-Discovery merger in 2022, where “optimism and increased synergies yield lower financial estimates.” “We believe that Paramount Skydance could be different from prior media industry combinations. But lowering initial profit guidance by 12% due to content acquisitions, despite raising run-rate synergy estimates by $1 billion gives us media merger déjà vu,” Morris said. If the company does not make a transformative acquisition, Morris questioned how content production would increase while reducing headcount driven costs, whether the UFC viewership would be enough to stabilize subscription trends and how it would become the industry’s most technologically capable media company when competing against Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and others. Paramount has said it plans to invest in excess of $1.5 billion in programming in 2026, including streaming investment in the UFC, Paramount+ originals, third-party catalog licensing and ramping up its film slate, with plans to target at least 15 movies per year over the next few years. Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ will also move to a unified backend infrastructure by mid-2026. Looking ahead, Paramount expects $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in revenue, or growth of 1% to 4% year over year, for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in streaming offset by declines in the TV Media and Filmed Entertainment segments. It also expects $500 million to $600 million in adjusted operating income. Additionally, the company anticipates a restructuring charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter related to its “realignment and transformation.” More than $1.4 billion in savings will have been generated between the merger closing in August and the end of 2025, with an additional $1 billion plus in cost savings planned for 2026. It expects to complete those cuts by the end of 2027, generating approximately $800 million in 2026 and between $400 million and $500 million in 2027. In addition to its recent layoffs of roughly 1,000 employees and approximately 600 employees who took voluntary severance in its return to office push, the media giant is also looking at areas such as real estate, procurement and workflow to find efficiencies. As part of a “comprehensive strategic review” of its assets, Paramount recently divested the Argentinian free-to-air network Telefe and is in the process of divesting Chilevisión in Chile, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2026. These divestitures will reduce the company’s workforce by approximately 1,600 additional employees. Paramount+ net adds are expected to come in lower than the third quarter due to the termination of two international hard bundles. On a full year basis, it expects streaming to be profitable in 2025, but with losses in the fourth quarter due to “seasonally-weighted content costs.” The streamer will raise prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. Theatrical revenue is also expected to be down as it reworks its film slate and is impacted by the comparison to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” Starting in the first quarter of 2026, Paramount will change its reporting structure to reflect its reorganization. The move will house all production and IP in one place with Studios, including almost all licensing revenue, while the remaining TV Media segment will be comprised of its broadcasting and cable businesses. For 2026, it is forecasting $30 billion in revenue, a 4% increase from the midpoint of its 2025 forecast, driven by streaming revenue growth due to price increases and the termination of additional international hard bundles, and an adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion, driven by progress in cost-cutting and investments in content and technology. The company expects a “more moderate” decline in linear advertising versus 2025 due to political spending in 2026, new ad agency partnerships, the sale of Telefe and the planned sale of Chilevisión. It also expects to grow streaming profitability in 2026, driven by the UFC, South Park and “several hundred million” dollars of investment in film and series for Paramount+, and return to profitability in its Filmed Entertainment segment on a full-year basis in 2026. Paramount expects to return to investment-grade debt metrics by the end of 2027. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.6 billion in gross debt. It also has $433 million in debt maturing within the next 12 months.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million active monthly ad-supported viewers. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Amazon says the 315 million figure represents an unduplicated average monthly active ad-supported audience across Originals, licensed series and films, live sports, events and free ad-supported live channels on Prime Video. The estimate is based on internal data collected over 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025, with some variations depending on launch dates. Over the past 18 months, Prime Video has rolled out advertising in 16 markets, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US.What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing Prime Video Advertising’s vice president Jeremy Helfand describes this number as a “transformative milestone” for the streamer. “This expanded audience across 16 countries demonstrates our customer-obsessed approach to enhancing the viewing experience while delivering powerful opportunities for brands,” he says. The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million monthly active viewers (MAV) globally for its ad tier. Netflix defines MAV as members who have watched at least one minute of ads in a month, multiplied by the estimated average number of people per household. Netflix said it hopes the MAV metric will become an industry-wide standard, noting that streaming platforms currently lack a universal measure for ad reach.Netflix hits 190 million monthly ad viewers according to new metric Separately, Amazon today (11 November) announced the international expansion of its AI-powered video generator tool to advertisers in the UK. The tool lets advertisers create “high-motion” videos from product images, existing videos or Amazon product detail pages. For example, a brand could create a video of a watch on someone’s wrist or a toy being actively played with by uploading an image of the product. In the US, where the feature launched in June, Amazon says more than 60% of products promoted with the video generator had never been advertised on the sponsored video page before. In the third quarter, total ad revenue across all of Amazon jumped 24% year-on-year, reaching $17.7bn, outpacing other tech giants, including Meta, Google and YouTube. AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Marketing Week’s weekly round-up of the technology stories that impact the marketing sector: from AI to martech, regulation to public perceptions. Amazon’s ad ranks in the top 7% of all ads this month, according to the latest The Works study. Cheez-It became the biggest launch in its category in four years, when it launched last year. Owner Kellanova has ambitions in the long-term to create an “iconic” brand in the UK. UK marketers are more likely to be “fully confident” in their abilities with AI, but there remains a gap between application and training. New research from LinkedIn’s B2B Institute and Ehrenberg-Bass urges B2B marketers to focus on being findable as much as being memorable.

Title: What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing

Time Published: 2025-11-11T06:42:31Z

AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Amazon’s decision to cut 14,000 jobs this quarter – roughly half the number initially feared – confirms what most boardrooms already know: artificial intelligence isn’t just a productivity tool, it’s a restructuring driver. Forget the polite language about “culture” from CEO Andy Jassy or “people and customers” from HR chief Beth Galetti. The driver is efficiency. Investors want AI-level margins, not human-level headcount. And Amazon isn’t the outlier. Nestlé plans to remove 12,000 white-collar roles over the next two years. Salesforce has already replaced 4,000 customer people with the rise of AI agents. UPS has shed nearly 50,000 jobs since 2024, citing machine learning. Agency Dentsu has trimmed 3,400 worldwide. Not all job losses are liked to AI or marketing – but many are. Check your LinkedIn feed and you’ll see the fallout: marketers, analysts, planners – ‘open to work’. Marketing Week’s 2025 Career & Salary Survey captured that unease across the industry. (If you haven’t already, do your profession a favour and take part in the latest survey before 21 November.) The pattern is clear. AI is collapsing the space between strategy and execution – the white-collar layer where much of marketing, operations and customer service used to live. The search-optimisation industry – worth billions globally – exists largely to please algorithms, not customers. As users move from classic search to AI search with Perplexity, ChatGPT and Claude, traditional SEO will fade. It’ll be replaced by a new layer of ‘generative engine optimisation’ (GEO) equally detached from customer value, perhaps just more automated. Posting, scheduling and A/B testing across Meta and TikTok are already automatable. The ‘digital native’ roles created in the 2010s – once seen as the new frontier – are now the first to go. The irony: the generation that disrupted traditional marketing is now being disrupted by its own tools. Routine copywriting and influencer work are being commoditised fast. Virtual influencers have already fronted campaigns for beauty brands like L’Oréal offering perpetual, low-cost exposure – without mood swings, agents or scheduling conflicts. The majority of consumers cannot tell – or do not care – that the presenter isn’t human. Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated classic Coke caravan holiday commercial marked a turning point. Writing on X, Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch captured the industry’s unease: “FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” The Verge, meanwhile, described Coke’s latest 2025 AI Christmas ads as “a sloppy eyesore”. But it’s early days and the shift is inevitable. I once flew 30 people to South Africa for 30 seconds of beach footage. If AI can render 50 versions of the same ad overnight, be my guest. Mondelez just spent $40m on generative video platforms promising to halve production costs. In that kind of math, efficiency always wins the budget battle. Good news. AI may bring rigour to an area marketers have long avoided: measurement. The excuse that “it’s too complex to track” is eroding. AI-driven attribution and modelling could finally give the industry what it has lacked for decades – a standardised way to diagnose growth and prove ROI. For a discipline often allergic to evidence, there’s a cultural reset coming. I’ve read 20 corporate layoff memos this quarter. Beyond AI, they all mention “less critical roles” and “unnecessary layers”. Context matters. European GDP (the UK included) will grow just over 1% this year; the US a tad more. Across most markets, budgets are tightening. In that climate, CEOs are asking one question with increasing regularity: does this role contribute to growth? If the answer is unclear, the role is at risk. I’ve said it for years – if marketers don’t stand for growth, they stand for nothing. Growth is the reason marketing exists. Yet large parts of the discipline still retreat into comfortable abstractions of ‘brand love’ and ‘storytelling’. In a world where CEOs get more serious about growth, those arguments won’t survive the meeting. Ask: what are my company’s top three priorities? What are my customers’ top three priorities? The overlap is where growth happens. That’s the value creation zone. Maybe a competitor has a better product. Maybe your pricing’s off. Maybe your media strategy is underpowered. Whatever your job description says, if you operate inside the value creation zone – and make that visible – your role will be relevant. Which parts of your job could AI do better or cheaper? If large chunks can be automated, they will be. You can’t out-AI AI. Replace yourself before someone else does. Let machines handle the routine while you trade up to what they still can’t do well: judgment, creativity and the courage to ask questions no dataset can answer. AI will add mediocrity – at scale. Boston Consulting Group ran a revealing experiment: two groups solved the same marketing problems; one using AI, one without. AI helped the group perform 40% better in a product innovation task but resulted in 41% less diversity of ideas. Machines replicate knowledge; they can’t generate intuition. AI makes average things for average people (hello, Mico). Great marketers work on the edges – where ideas still feel slightly dangerous. Very soon, every marketer will face their own ‘Matrix moment’ – accept automation’s illusion of control, or take back the job of creating growth. Here’s the choice: Take the blue pill, and hand over your marketing to the machines (Meta and co are building that version of the future). Take the red pill, and step up as a growth leader who uses AI as leverage. The choice is existential. In the AI economy, marketing rainmakers stay. Everyone else may become optional. Amid wider strategic shifts, some B2B firms are experimenting with new senior roles in an effort to “redefine” marketing. Emotion and vulnerability are celebrated in advertising, but often lacking in leadership. It’s a double standard marketers must stop ignoring. Marketers who see brand building as an end in itself are mistaking the work they do for the results it delivers. Brands now make up 90% of Premier Foods’ revenue, up from around 83% a few years ago, with the company having reduced its sales made up from private label. Vitality subverted category expectations and beat sales targets with a proactive proposition focused on living a better life. Brands need to think about how they can help consumers find a spark of joy against a challenging economic and social background. From navigating the risk of “blanding” to building trust, B2B marketers explain how they use AI for content, creative and to “get ahead of bad ideas”.

Title: Job cuts hit 22-year October high as retail layoffs from Amazon to Target mount ahead of holidays

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail. U.S. firms announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years, fueled in part by mass layoffs at major retail companies. Employers slashed 153,074 jobs last month, up 175% from a year earlier, according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. October’s total marked the highest for the month since 2003, driven largely by cost-cutting, though artificial intelligence ranked as the second-most cited factor. Year-to-date layoffs were already at their highest level since 2020 before the heavy downsizing that occurred last month. Retail has been one of the hardest hit industries this year, behind only warehousing and non-profits. So far in 2025, the sector has announced 88,664 job cuts, a 145% increase from the 36,136 recorded through October last year. The cuts come after a series of large-scale reductions across the retail industry. Amazon announced plans last week to eliminate 14,000 corporate roles as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, meanwhile, shed 1,800 white-collar positions amid slowing sales. Other consumer-facing companies such as Starbucks and UPS have pared back staff in recent months. “There was an enormous amount of hiring that happened in that post-Covid period in retail, and retail is facing some other specific issues,” Andrew Challenger, workplace and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Modern Retail in an interview. “Tariffs, immigration and persistent inflation — all of that can be affecting retail in ways that are causing [retailers] to have to make strategic changes.” All told, the wave of layoffs has cast a pall heading into the peak holiday shopping season, retail’s busiest time of year. It’s been a tough year for the industry thanks to stubborn inflation, bleak consumer sentiment and President Donald Trump’s trade war — the U.S. average tariff rate is at its highest level since 1934, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University. Retail’s corporate belt-tightening ahead of the holidays underscores the pressure consumer companies are under to drive sales and maintain profitability in a tough economic climate. “Retailers are simply trying to do more with less,” said Sky Canaves, a retail analyst at eMarketer. The timing of October’s layoffs is particularly striking given how close they are to the holiday shopping season. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” Challenger said in the report. “With the onset of social media, and the ability for workers to share their negative experiences with their employers, the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays — a practice that seemed particularly cruel — fell away.” Retailers are also pulling back on holiday hiring. Companies are expected to add fewer than 500,000 seasonal positions this year — the lowest since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Several retailers, including Kohl’s and Target, have declined to disclose their 2025 seasonal hiring plans, a departure from previous years. Some companies plan to keep the seasonal hiring levels unchanged from 2024. Amazon said it plans to hire 250,000 workers for the peak holiday season, while Bath & Body Works announced plans to hire 32,000 workers, the same as last year for both companies. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge,” Challenger said. He added that seasonal employers are contending with a mix of challenges this year, including lingering inflation and tariffs. As such, companies are increasingly relying on automation and permanent staff over large waves of seasonal hires. “It’s not that people aren’t going to stores — foot traffic isn’t expected to fall much — but with fewer staff, the quality of the consumer experience could suffer.” EMarketer’s Canaves warned that leaner staffing could become a self-fulfilling cycle. “When shoppers have bad experiences in stores because they can’t get sales help or the lines are too long, they’re less likely to return,” she said Still, expectations for consumer spending power during the holidays offer a glimmer of hope. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising 3.7-4.2% over last year. EMarketer’s own forecast is slightly more conservative at $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year-over-year. Canaves said the outlook remains solid because “people keep spending even if they have to borrow or use payment plans like buy-now, pay-later to do so.” But that spending strength is increasingly uneven. “We’re kind of seeing a K-shaped consumer economy, where upper-income consumers are spending more and lower-income consumers are spending less,” she said. Amazon’s latest layoffs mark the company’s most sweeping since 2022. The tech and retail giant more than doubled its workforce during the pandemic, expanding from roughly 800,000 employees in 2019 to more than 1.6 million by 2021 to meet surging e-commerce demand. Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s recent report flagged cost-cutting and artificial intelligence as the primary drivers behind the October layoffs. However, Amazon CEO Andy Jasy told analysts on a quarterly earnings call last week that the e-commerce giant’s latest layoffs were about “culture,” not finance or AI. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, … you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy said. Reducing those layers is all part of Amazon’s mission to operate “like the world’s largest startup,” he added. While the cuts affect everything from software engineering to video games to advertising, retail management roles were hit hardest, according to internal data cited by Business Insider. That may reflect a broader sea change within Amazon, as its retail business now accounts for just 40.5% of total revenue, down from 60% in 2018, per e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse. Target’s restructuring followed a similar rationale. The company previously told Modern Retail its decision to cut roughly 1,000 team members and leave another 800 roles unfilled was meant to speed up decision-making rather than save money.“ The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” For the latest Inside the publisher C-Suite series, Digiday spoke to Forbes CEO Sherry Phillips on its AI-era playbook, starting with its AI-powered dynamic paywall to new creator-led commercial opportunities.

Title: Paramount Posts Q3 Loss of $257 Million in First Earnings Post-Skydance Deal

Time Published: 2025-11-10T21:24:43Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The media giant’s revenue was flat at $6.7 billion, weighed down by declines in TV advertising and distribution In its first quarter since the closing of Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition, Paramount swung to a loss of $257 million as revenue growth was flat at $6.7 billion. The results for its third quarter, which were weighed down by declines in linear TV advertising and distribution, included a $13 million loss under its new owner Skydance and $244 million under the media giant’s previous leadership. The company reported $2.58 billion in revenue for the quarter under previous leadership and $4.12 billion under new leadership. Despite missing Wall Street expectations, Paramount shares jumped 6% in after-hours trading on Monday as the David Ellison-led media giant raised its cost savings target to $3 billion and outlined its vision for the future. “While we’re still in the early stages, this is only day 96,” Paramount CEO David Ellison told analysts during the company’s earnings call. “We’re energized by the progress we’ve made and the clear path ahead.” Here are the results: Net loss: A loss of $257 million, compared to a profit of $1 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share: Loss of 37 cent per share, with an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share, compared to earnings of 38 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Revenue: $6.7 billion, compared to $6.99 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Streaming subscribers: Added 1.4 million subscribers for a total of 79.1 million globally. Starting in the fourth quarter, Paramount will no longer include free trialers in its total subscriber count. As of the end of the third quarter, free trialers totaled 1.2 million. Revenue in its streaming business grew 17% year-over-year to $2.17 billion, driven by a 24% increase in Paramount+ revenue to $1.77 billion. Paramount’s streaming business posted a profit of $340 million, including $105 million pre-merger and $235 million post-merger, compared to $49 million a year ago. But the TV Media segment was a drag on the overall results, with revenue falling 12% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 12% decline in advertising on lower political spending and underreported revenue from an international sales partner in 2024; a 7% decline in affiliate revenue due to cord-cutting; and a 22% decline in licensing and other revenue due to the timing of content delivery. The segment posted a profit of $822 million, down from a profit of $936 million a year ago. Filmed Entertainment revenue grew 30% to $756 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Skydance licensing and other revenue. However, the segment swung to a loss of $49 million due to lower than expected performance of its film slate during the quarter, with disappointments like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun.” The latest quarterly results come as the company has submitted three separate bids to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, which ranged between $19 and $23.50 per share and were rejected for being too low. It also comes on the heels of Paramount’s $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. Paramount has raised its cost savings target to $3 billion, up from $2 billion previously. That plan has included roughly 1,000 layoffs thus far, with additional cuts to come at a later date. In addition to the formal layoffs, Paramount will begin a phased return to office in January. Approximately 600 employees chose voluntary severance packages in its first phase. More than $1.4 billion in savings will have been generated between the merger closing in August and the end of 2025, with an additional $1 billion plus in cost savings planned for 2026. It expects to complete those cuts by the end of 2027, generating approximately $800 million in 2026 and between $400 million and $500 million in 2027. In addition to labor, the media giant is also looking at areas such as real estate, procurement and workflow to find efficiencies. As part of a “comprehensive strategic review” of its assets, Paramount recently divested the Argentinian free-to-air network Telefe and is in the process of divesting Chilevision in Chile, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2026. These divestitures will reduce the company’s workforce by approximately 1,600 additional employees. At the same time, Paramount plans to invest in excess of $1.5 billion in programming in 2026, including streaming investment in the UFC, Paramount+ originals, third-party catalog licensing and ramping up its film slate, with plans to target at least 15 movies per year over the next few years. The company has set new deals with the UFC, Professional Bull Riders and Zuffa Boxing, greenlit new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and forged partnerships with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers, Will Smith and James Mangold. Though Taylor Sheridan is set to exit the company after his contract expires in 2028, he has also been tapped to work on a film adaptation of video game franchise “Call of Duty” with Peter Berg. Paramount also plans to raise prices for Paramount+ in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. Leadership has said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, which would increase efficiencies, help with search, discovery and recommendations and boost content creation. “We really view AI as a tool for artists to be able to iterate more quickly, to be able to tell better stories and basically create even further accessibility, really, across the entire content creation pipeline,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we think technology is going to impact all aspects of our business and we want to be a leader in that space.” Paramount will also leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with David’s father Larry Ellison’s Oracle, which the company has paid $2 million for software support agreements and database licenses since the merger closed. Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ will move to a unified backend infrastructure by mid-2026 and the media giant will use a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) system by early 2027, which David Ellison said would lead to “significant operational efficiency” across the company and “give better real-time information to managers.” “The better visibility you have in terms of how the company is doing on a day-to-day basis, that improves your decision making. So we’re in the process of deploying that,” he added. Ellison has argued the Paramount would be the “best partner” for WBD, adding that other potential acquirers would need to overcome “significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles given their dominant market positions.” In an Oct. 13 letter to WBD’s board, Paramount argued that the value to shareholders in a break-up would be less than $15 per share or roughly $18 to $20 per share including a “robust, yet highly uncertain, M&A premium for Warner Bros,” an individual familiar with the matter confirmed to TheWrap. In order to sweeten the bid, Ellison even offered Warner CEO David Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title, as well as increasing the portion of the bid paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80% and increasing the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. CNBC reported that Paramount is also considering taking a tender offer directly to WBD shareholders and formalizing a hostile bid for the company. If successful in acquiring WBD, TheWrap previously reported that Ellison would look to merge HBO Max and Paramount+ into a “super platform” under one scenario being considered. The theatrical model is also at the core of his vision and a combined company would look to target an output of 30 films per year as part of its commitment to that model. “It’s important to know that there’s no must-haves for us — we really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call when asked about WBD and the company’s M&A strategy. “We believe we can achieve our goals with our creative content engines, we believe we can achieve our streaming goals and that we can drive enterprise efficiency and create value and long term free cash flow generation all through the building standpoint.” Ellison said Paramount would make M&A decisions that tie back into its core principles. “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long term disciplined owner operators,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we’ll always approach things through the lens of how do we maximize value for shareholders.” Paramount president Jeff Shell also reiterated that the company would hang onto its cable networks. “This company has a history of spinning assets and it hasn’t gone very well for us and we think for others,” Shell explained. “One of the big rationales for a spin is that when companies are standalone, they can focus on driving the value of the brands that they have in a more specific way. We are going to do that, but we’re going to do that within our company so our shareholders get the value of that.” He also noted that the declines in broadcast are “very modest” compared to cable and that its content is “increasingly a huge driver” for streaming subscriber growth and engagement. Shell said the company plans to increase its investments in CBS and look at its brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET to see if it can “transform those businesses in a digital way to drive value long term and make them increasing pieces of our overall scale and global streaming strategy.” Looking ahead, Paramount expects $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in revenue, or growth of 1% to 4% year over year, for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in streaming offset by declines in the TV Media and Filmed Entertainment segments. It also expects $500 million to $600 million in adjusted operating income. Additionally, the company anticipates a restructuring charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter related to its “realignment and transformation.” Paramount+ net adds are expected to come in lower than the third quarter due to the termination of two international hard bundles. On a full year basis, it expects streaming to be profitable in 2025, but losses in the fourth quarter due to “seasonally-weighted content costs.” Theatrical revenue is also expected to be down as it reworks its film slate and is impacted by the comparison to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” Starting in the first quarter of 2026, Paramount will change its reporting structure to reflect its reorganization. The move will house all production and IP in one place with Studios, including almost all licensing revenue, while the remaining TV Media segment will be comprised of its broadcasting and cable businesses. For 2026, it is forecasting $30 billion in revenue, a 4% increase from the midpoint of its 2025 forecast, driven by streaming revenue growth due to price increases and the termination of additional international hard bundles, and adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion, driven by progress in cost-cutting and investments in content and technology. The company expects a “more moderate” decline in linear advertising versus 2025 due to political spending in 2026, new ad agency partnerships, the sale of Telefe and the planned sale of Chilevision. It also expects to grow streaming profitability in 2026, driven by the UFC, South Park and “several hundred million” dollars of investment in film and series for Paramount+, and return to profitability in its Filmed Entertainment segment on a full-year basis in 2026. Paramount expects to return to investment grade debt metrics by the end of 2027. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.6 billion in gross debt. It also has $433 million in debt maturing over the next 12 months.

Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. A leading investment bank has delivered an arresting diagnosis of the U.S. economy: the labor market, long a pillar of resilience, may be in real trouble. In their latest economic outlook, UBS economists led by Jonathan Pingle painted a picture of mounting weakness that extends well beyond headline job numbers, warning of a growing risk to households and the broader recovery. The latest “US Economics Weekly” note from the Swiss investment bank came with bated breath ahead of the impending end of the federal government shutdown. Economists and market-watchers have been deprived of federal economic data for over 40 days, something that former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen likened to “flying blind” in late October. If the government does reopen, Pingle’s team said it expects jobs data for September to be released next week, and potentially the October inflation report, the Consumer Price Index. Economists need that data now more than ever. For much of the year, top economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have said we’re in a “low hire, low fire” jobs market. For much of the year, employers were laconic in hiring, and seemed afraid to fire their workers; perhaps still wounded from the pandemic-era “Great Resignation.” UBS isn’t alone on Wall Street in worrying that, maybe the “low-fire” part of the equation isn’t quite true anymore. Now, “there are plenty of available workers that, on the whole, businesses probably don’t feel the need to hold on to workers for longer than necessary,” Veronica Clark, a Citigroup Inc. economist, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, also told Bloomberg that “you’ve got a substantial number of well-established companies making pretty big head cuts.” Firing is running higher than advertised, UBS argued, citing the fact that “unemployment insurance claims, layoff announcements and WARN notices have all been running ahead of the pre-pandemic pace. Even the lagged Business Employment Dynamics data, the gold standard of data on job creation and job destruction dynamics has been showing the pace of job loss at or above the pre-pandemic pace through the latest data.” Indeed, cuts have accelerated sharply. October saw 157,000 layoffs announced by corporations, per industry standard Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the highest monthly total since July 2020. Technology and warehousing were hit especially hard, with cuts also linked to automation and artificial intelligence.​ The year-to-date tally? A startling 760,000 seasonally adjusted cuts through October, far outpacing the same period in 2024 and running higher than any year since 2009 — the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. Major companies are taking action: Amazon cut 14,000 corporate roles, UPS has slashed 48,000 jobs over the past year, and Target eliminated nearly 2,000 staff in a single sweep.​ Workers are getting thrown into a growing pool of others not finding jobs. UBS likens the job market to a bathtub: with outflows (layoffs) steady and inflows (hiring) slowing, the water level (total jobs) is bound to fall. The hiring rate, as measured by multiple business surveys, has dropped to levels historically seen only in recessions. Excluding healthcare and social assistance, which have been relatively steady, private-sector payrolls have been declining by an average of 36,000 jobs per month. Since the start of the year, household employment as measured by the main government survey has been falling by about 72,000 jobs per month through August. Such a pace is “well below” the rate required to keep up with population growth, let alone maintain a stable unemployment rate, which has now crept up to a post-2021 high. Labor force participation has slipped, and more than 800,000 people have left the labor force but say they still want a job.​ Economists note the broadest measure of underemployment, known as U-6, has jumped by 0.6 percentage points since January to 8.1%. That’s now 1.3 percentage points higher than at the end of 2019. Notably, the rise isn’t just about people out of work: more Americans are working part-time for economic reasons, another classic sign of slackening demand. “That is exactly the opposite of what should happen under a negative labor supply shock stemming from immigration,” UBS wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s argument that immigration restrictions would tighten the labor market. Job openings continue to decline: as of the end of October, Indeed.com reported that postings had sunk to their lowest level since 2021, with almost every sector seeing year-over-year drops. Meanwhile, the weekly average of initial unemployment claims is running above 2023’s level and continuing claims are nearing a post-pandemic high.​ And even the openings that appear active, Pingle argued, may not be tied to real hiring efforts. The hiring rate “consistent with recession” has been a gap “so large that seemingly many of the openings probably are not seeing much effort to be filled,” according to Pingle. “We can also look at the 14 million people not working but who want a job or are searching for one, or the 2 million collecting unemployment benefits. Given that abundance, it would seem that at least some of the openings do not appear anxious to be filled.” Not only are workers losing jobs, but the market for new opportunities is shrinking as well. Seasonal hiring plans for the holidays are running well below pre-pandemic norms. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reports a combined September/October total of just 400,000 announced holiday roles — sharply lower than the 625,000 average for the 2014–19 period and even below recent years. Key retailers like Target aren’t even disclosing numbers, and the National Retail Federation suggests seasonal jobs could be down 40% from a year ago.​ This chill is hitting consumer and business sentiment. The University of Michigan’s consumer confidence reading dropped to 50.3 in November, barely above the all-time low set in 2022. Fewer households report jobs are plentiful, and the share expecting unemployment to rise over the next year has soared to levels not seen since the recession-scarred 1980s. Among small businesses, optimism is “struggling to gain traction” amid inflation fears and continued labor market turmoil.​ Federal Reserve officials are increasingly divided, with some policymakers warning that the risk to jobs now rivals concerns about inflation. While some see an argument for interest rate cuts to buffer the labor market, others worry inflation isn’t yet tamed. One Fed governor admitted she worries because “the labor market can deteriorate very quickly,” calling for caution and flexibility as each new set of economic data is released.​ The investment bank’s conclusion? If layoffs keep pace and hiring continues to slow, the labor market is headed for “more obvious contraction.” And that, they warn, could soon filter down to undermine household confidence, consumer spending — and the entire recovery. “If a bathtub is draining faster and faster while the faucet isn’t changed, eventually the water level is going to start to drop. That is a material risk to the outlook.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The old proverb “new brooms sweep clean” is often misleadingly mentioned to suggest that new hires are more thorough. That drops the cautionary second part of the proverb that should not be ignored: “but an old broom knows the corners.” The wisdom of the full saying rings especially true when considering how the nascent turnaround effort at iconic retail chain Target appears to be coming into focus, despite widespread initial skepticism. While the path forward remains challenging, could Target’s turnaround be right on target despite all the naysayers? That skepticism apparently ran so deep, that merely two months ago, when Target announced that longtime, widely admired CEO Brian Cornell would be retiring and that 20-year company veteran Michael Fiddelke would take the reins, the stock immediately plummeted 8%, with sellside Wall Street analysts commenting that “investors were hopeful for an external hire,” and “this internal appointment does not remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and inward-looking mindset.” (Target stock is down by more than one-third year-to-date.) Despite Fiddelke’s resume – having originally started at Target over two decades ago as an intern, and working in practically every job at the company across retail, merchandising, operations, finance, and supply chain since – many seemed to have written him off from the start, primarily by virtue of his insider status. But could that have been premature? It’s understandable that investors often have a knee-jerk preference for outsiders to parachute into companies in turbulent times. We acknowledge there is never any one-size-fits-all solution – there are always certain situations where an outsider may be genuinely necessary to shake things up and clear the deck. For example, Cornell himself came to Target from PepsiCo when Target was mired in crisis amidst a costly data breach and plummeting revenues, and he got Target back to growth within a couple of years. But our new, original analysis of recent Fortune 500 CEO successions suggests that surprisingly, internal CEOs have been consistently outperforming external CEOs, with dramatic outperformance in terms of total shareholder return (TSR). We analyzed all CEO transitions taking place in the Fortune 500, and we found that of the 61 CEO transitions which took place over the last year, the 39 CEOs who were elevated from within, have generated an average TSR of 14.81% on an annualized basis, while the 22 CEOs who were selected from the outside have generated an average TSR of -9.01% on an annualized basis. Could that be a one-year fluke? We ran the numbers over a longer-term period, and found that the same trend consistently held true. We found that of the 93 CEO transitions which took place over the last one to three years, the 71 internal CEOs have generated a 10.16% average annualized return, while the 22 external CEOs have generated a 6.35% average annualized return. Likewise, of the 84 CEO transitions in the Fortune 500 which took place over the last three to five years, the 70 internal CEOs have generated a 12.68% average annualized return while the 13 external CEOs have generated a 6.42% average annualized return. Simply put, the data is clear that no matter how you slice and dice it, there has been dramatic stock outperformance by internal CEOs vs. external CEOs when it comes to recent Fortune 500 CEO transitions. The conclusions drawn from our original analysis of recent CEO performance closely parallel the findings of other renowned management and corporate governance scholars. In his 2007 book, “The CEO Within,” Harvard Business School’s Joseph Bower found that externally recruited CEOs often lack the in-depth knowledge of the company’s culture and history needed to succeed. Similarly, Stanford’s David Larcker and Brian Tayan found that the data consistently shows across decades that internal CEOs outperform external CEOs. Many scholars have found the same conclusion holds true over more discrete time periods even beyond the ones we measured, such as during the COVID pandemic. While there is never a one-size-fits-all prescription that works in all cases, the data seems to suggest that the greatest change agent CEOs tend to come from within – internal CEOs tend to have a deep understanding of their company, what makes it tick, and even more importantly, where the bodies are buried, and what needs to change – and with the know-how, cultural savvy, and buy-in needed to make tough decisions on day one. As he retires, Brian Cornell has much to be proud of as one of the most admired and accomplished CEOs in retail. During his decade-plus tenure, he has transformed Target from a beleaguered company beset by crises when he arrived, into a retail powerhouse with over $100 billion of revenue today; successfully transitioned Target into an omnichannel retailer with significant e-commerce capabilities; reinvigorated the company’s lucrative, higher-margin private brand business to the tune of more than $30 billion a year in sales; and expanded the company’s geographic footprint to nearly 2,000 fully owned stores. And while the current stock price doesn’t reflect all these achievements, he has bought back billions in stock while raising the dividend every year during his tenure; all while continuing Target’s commitment to dedicating 5% of its total profits to communities, which it has done without break since 1946. Cornell’s prescient, industry-leading strategy to invest in stores in 2017 to build them into e-commerce fulfillment hubs paid off massively, enabling exponential e-commerce growth at Target, especially early on during the pandemic, with consumers embracing Target’s same-day home delivery and drive by pick-up service. This business, which was virtually built from scratch, now generates $20 billion a year and is still rapidly growing. Derived from Target’s burgeoning e-commerce platform is Target’s digital advertising business, which now generates $2 billion a year for the company and is still rapidly growing as well. At the same time, the complexity of running stores as distribution centers has created gaps in the store experience, and Target needs to provide consumers with a more premium, consistent shopping experience. Fiddelke will need to navigate a challenging road forward for Target, which has seen sales stagnate since peaking three years ago. Target has a higher mix of consumer discretionary products vis a vis competitors such as Walmart and Costco, whose product mix lean more towards consumer staples. This benefits Target when its merchandise is trend setting and differentiated, but can also be a headwind when consumers are stretched or managing budgets tightly. Fiddelke’s emphasis on restoring Target’s style authority may be the biggest factor in driving future growth here. Regardless, there is just no mistaking the magnitude of Target’s current challenges. To succeed, Fiddelke will need to put forward a comprehensive turnaround strategy as 2026 beckons, with the planned CEO transition looming in February 2026. Consumer spending is showing signs of slowing down amidst market share losses to key competitors, and Target will need to do a better job of both providing value to the financially stressed consumer; while also better differentiating its discretionary products to recapture higher spending consumers. Target needs to recapture its reputation for combining style, quality and value in a way other retailers don’t. There are some potential growth enhancers. While Target’s loyalty program, Target Circle, has over 100 million members; investors will be looking to see how Fiddelke can better leverage those memberships. Unlike Walmart or Amazon, Target Circle is free to join, and there is a big opportunity for Target to increase the offerings and value to attract more consumers while further monetizing the platform. Target has been testing different promotions, personalized offers, gamifying rewards, free gifts and working to increase awareness of the benefits, with a focus of driving upper-level paid premium memberships that come with 5% discounts on purchases and unlimited same-day home delivery. These initiatives have the potential to not only accelerate digital growth but also drive overall traffic and sales growth. Similarly, there is a significant opportunity for Target’s third-party marketplace business, Target+, which enables outside vendors to sell products on its website with attractive profit margins to Target, to grow significantly in the years ahead. Fiddelke appears to be meeting these challenges head-on. Virtually all observers agreed that the recent news of Target laying off 8% of its corporate workforce was difficult but necessary in rightsizing Target’s workforce. Analysts at Jefferies noted, “This is an early signal that Fiddelke is willing to make tough calls. The layoffs are essential to restore agility and cost discipline. If paired with initiatives to reignite traffic and improve digital execution, these actions could lay the groundwork for a turnaround”. These initial green shoots of progress have been warmly welcomed, with Target stock up nearly 10% over the last month. Furthermore, Target is continuing exclusive premiers with blockbuster talent like Taylor Swift, who just released her new “Life of Showgirl” album with exclusive related merchandize items available only at Target, continuing a highly profitable enviable relationship since 2008. But that marks only the start, and much more is needed. To sustain momentum, Target will need to communicate an even more sweeping, comprehensive turnaround strategy covering all aspects of Fiddelke’s new strategy in detail, perhaps around a potential investor day next spring. Clearly, there is strong appetite for bold, decisive moves, even if it means ripping off the band-aid right up front and working through some transitory pain. Then, from there, all eyes will be on execution. While our original analysis suggests that internal CEOs tend to have stronger track records of execution, the onus will be on Fiddelke to show that this leadership team of experienced Target veterans can hit the bulls-eye once Target’s target is in sight.

Title: When the AI Bubble Bursts, the Damage Will Be Severe

The AI bubble is both massive and nearing its end. At least that’s how we read the tea leaves. When it bursts…the damage is going to be profound, financially, economically and even politically. The AI bubble has gotten so massive and so complicated and so perversely organized that even the WSJ is having trouble figuring out how to describe the circular deals and money flows. When this bubble bursts, it will be the most damaging in US history, by far. The amounts involved are truly staggering, measured in the supposed market valuations of the top 5 companies – Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Google. Together, they are ‘worth’ more than $19 trillion. Nvidia alone is valued in the stock market at more than $5 trillion. But let’s back up for a moment. What is a bubble? This is my favorite definition: “A bubble exists when asset prices rise beyond what incomes can sustain.” Using this definition, consider AI leader OpenAI, which has a purported $13 billion in yearly revenue, but which is losing billions more on top of that, having made capital spending commitments with other AI companies totaling $1.4 trillion. The value of all the other involved companies has spiked on the news of the commitments, but where is that money going to come from? Nobody has yet said and OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, refuses to answer: Sam Altman appears tired of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its trillion-dollar-plus spending commitments as a startup bringing in a fraction of that in annual revenue. In a testy moment during a recent podcast interview with investor Brad Gerstner on the “Bg2 Pod,” Altman was asked “the single biggest question” that is “hanging over the market.” “How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?” Gerstner asked the OpenAI CEO. “You’ve heard the criticism, Sam.” OpenAI has invested heavily in infrastructure and compute, striking multi-billion-dollar deals to secure more Nvidia chips and energy to fuel its AI ambitions. The latest came Monday morning, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with AWS. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said in response to Gerstner’s question. “Enough.” (Source) It’s extremely weird for a CEO to refuse to answer the most basic of questions about their business model. Unless, of course, that CEO already knew there was no good answers to be given and was being evasive in an attempt to buy some time while they try to sort out a revenue model. In other words, the asset price of his company has risen far beyond what incomes can sustain. The day after recording this podcast with Paul Kiker, Sam Altman tipped his hand further by – I am not making this up – requesting that US taxpayers guarantee the gargantuan loans he needs in order to continue his money-losing project: Sam Altman over at OpenAI wants the US government to provide and guarantee loans for its expansion.Up to a trillion.No, I’m not joking. pic.twitter.com/i4XRjpPPQn On top of that, we’ve also got the CEO of Nvidia now warning that China may ‘win’ the AI race (whatever that means). JUST IN – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang says, "China is going to win the AI race." — Financial Times The pattern is worryingly the same as we saw right before the internet bubble burst in 2000. I see a pattern…Altman and Jenson smell the end of bubble (financing drying up) and are going to ask Daddy for taxpayer money citing national security issues. https://t.co/d8l30BRFSj pic.twitter.com/ASHRJZkcMu And this is the same behavior observed before the infamous South Sea Bubble of the 1700’s blew up. My favorite pitch for South Sea shares? “The company is being formed for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” (Source) That, at least, was direct and honest. I’m getting the same vibes today from Sam Altman. Meanwhile, the actual economy, the one based on real products being made, transported and sold to real people, is shredding at an alarming rate. Freightwaves CEO: "Well, we should be worried. The goods economy, certain portions of the goods economy are collapsing right now. So, year over year trucking volumes, this is really predominance of freight that moves across the United States, is down 17%". "But when you look at… pic.twitter.com/DuCIgJNjWS This is why, when the AI bubble bursts, the damage will be so severe. There’s no solid support beneath it. The real economy is suffering with job layoffs for October the highest since 2003: Layoffs in October were the highest since 2003: pic.twitter.com/QnQ33KFyGZ And that’s with $2+ trillion of government deficit spending, the Fed cutting rates, and financial conditions being extremely easy as M2 grows.

Companies are simultaneously announcing record AI investments and widespread layoffs, often for the same organizations. While AI is cited as a driver for these cuts, many initiatives show no return on investment. Layoffs, especially large ones, can undermine innovation and employee morale, potentially hindering the very AI adoption they aim to facilitate.

Title: The best PC hardware and software of 2025/2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. When historians look back at the PC industry in 2025, they’ll probably remember a time of intense turmoil. Between wildly unpredictable tariffs, geopolitical strife, the AI boom, hardware shortages caused by the AI boom (and tariffs), and hundreds of thousands of industry layoffs, it’s been an eventful – and stressful – year for the PC. Nonetheless, great things happened. We’ve seen the launch of entire new graphics card generations from Nvidia and AMD. The laptops of today are the laptops of tomorrow we’ve always dreamed of. Handheld gaming is exploding in popularity, leaving Microsoft scrambling to make Windows a viable alternative to Valve’s SteamOS on those devices. Security is evolving daily to protect a new breed of AI-powered attacks. Today is a day to celebrate the best of times. This is the Best PC Hardware and Software of 2025, as chosen by PCWorld’s editors. The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition) is the most impressive Windows laptop we tested this year, and I’ll tell you exactly why. It combines a stunning 14-inch 2880×1800 OLED display with HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate, beastly specs (including an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and Intel Arc 140V graphics), and a battery that can last up to 23 hours. It’s speedy enough to handle work tasks and binge-watching your favorite show on Netflix and, at under three pounds, it won’t break your back. The 2-in-1 design is nice too, especially if you move around a lot. You can flip it into tablet mode or set it up like a little tent. This versatility is cool when you’re working with limited space like in an airplane seat, for example. The keyboard and trackpad also feel great, and the Yoga Pen sticks right to the top so it’s always handy when you’re ready to create your next masterpiece… or just doodle for fun! -Ashley Biancuzzo Nvidia bet the fate of the GeForce RTX 50-series on DLSS 4’s incredible multi-frame gen feature. As magical as the feature can be, it left most of the RTX 50 lineup feeling flat at best, or as uninspiring sidegrades at best. Not the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. Unlike most of the 50-series lineup, the 5070 Ti includes a sizeable performance uplift, while costing less – versus the 4070 Ti, you get 25 percent faster performance for $50 less. Better yet, the 5070 Ti’s prowess makes it the perfect vehicle for DLSS 4’s multi-frame gen – the card delivers killer 1440p and solid 4K performance as-is, but flipping on MFG takes visual smoothness and frame pacing to utterly sublime levels. You’re going to want to pair this beast with a 240Hz monitor if you can manage it. In a weak and price-engorged generation for graphics cards, only the RTX 5070 Ti and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 series stand out as particularly appealing. The amazing power of DLSS 4 earns Nvidia this well-deserved nod. If you’re dismissing MFG as “fake frames,” you’re missing out. –Brad Chacos The battery life on the HP OmniBook 5 14 is utter insanity. We’re talking over 25 hours in our testing–you can thank the super-efficient Snapdragon X Plus processor for that one. The 14-inch 1920×1200 OLED touchscreen also looks great because of its wide color gamut and high contrast ratio. While it’ll breeze through most day-to-day tasks, it isn’t a gaming rig or a 3D workstation, so you may want to mind how you use it. That said, the main draw here is the ridiculous battery life and an OLED display that truly pops… all for under $900! This is one stunner of a laptop. -Ashley Biancuzzo This year, the monitor that stood out as the best overall – i.e., the monitor most likely to satisfy the versatile needs of the majority of users – was the Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED. Our high regard began with its big, sharp, colorful 4K QD-OLED panel. It grew with the 120Hz refresh rate and support for Adaptive Sync, making it a suitable option for work as well as entertainment, even gaming. With two video inputs (HDMI 2.1 and USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4 support), 90 watts of Power Delivery for connecting to either Windows or Mac laptops, and two USB-C downstream ports supporting 15 watts of USB Power Delivery and 5Gbps of data, it’s up for productivity. The monitor goes on to sweeten the pot with five speakers – wait, what? — for 25 total watts and support for spatial audio. Finally, it seals the deal with a price that undercuts the competition — $850 MSRP, but currently hovering around $700 on Amazon. – Katherine Stevenson Staying sane while dealing with online security is much easier with a password manager. A good password manager, that is—one that quickly creates and fills in strong passwords, stores passkeys, immediately alerts you to compromised or weak passwords, and lets you securely share credentials with others. Dashlane gets the highest possible marks from us not just for its dependability, but its regular updates, too. In particular, the service now supports full passwordless login, which lets you sign in to your Dashlane account without a password. It’s also one of the first to implement secure import/export of passkeys and passwords (aka CXP). This puts it on the leading edge of credential security—other password managers are still working on their rollout. Combined with standard features like passkey support and dark web monitoring, plus surprising extras like VPN access and real-time phishing protection, Dashlane provides a lot of broad protection for your logins. Other password managers may be cheaper, but not as complete. -Alaina Yee You might expect our pick for best SSD to use the latest-gen PCIe 5.0 interface, which can be 100 percent faster than the previous generation. But while the prospect of such blazing-fast transfer speeds is certainly tantalizing, for most everyday computing activities, including gaming, PCIe 4.0 performs comparably to PCIe 5.0 — and for a lot less money! This is why our pick for best SSD is the WD Black SN7100 SSD, a PCIe 4.0 drive whose overall benchmark performance bested those of its peers, even if only by small margins. The upshot is that this drive is fast, and it features a reassuring five-year warranty. Better still, at $74 for 1TB, it’s half the cost of the best PCIe 5.0 drive. Need we say more? – Katherine Stevenson Adam Patrick Murray / Foundry It’s been a slow year for CPUs. Perhaps in reaction to 2024’s performance issues and regressions, both Intel and AMD have been quiet on the desktop front. Instead, focus has been on laptop CPUs. The lone bright spot for desktop enthusiasts? AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X3D. We saw it coming. Last year, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivered stupendous performance in both gaming and content creation. A flagship version would be even beastlier—and the 9950X3D proved that assumption right. Against the Intel Core 9 285K, the 9950X3D showed gaming performance lifts ranging from 25 to 48 percent (!) and a content creation performance boost of about 10 percent on average. And that’s at stock settings. Turn on PBO and you get another bump in performance. The only disappointing thing about the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is that it takes the title with no real competition. But that doesn’t make it a bad chip. On its own merits—and no matter what kind of PC user you are—it’s a win. -Alaina Yee I expected 2025 to be a breakout year for Thunderbolt 5 docking stations, and I wasn’t disappointed. Many docks I received, however, were priced at the high end of the spectrum. Plugable’s TBT-UDT3 was a notable exception, a moderately-priced laptop docking station I could recommend to those who needed a current-generation Thunderbolt 4 dock or who were looking to invest in next-gen Thunderbolt 5 hardware. Why did I weigh price so heavily? Two reasons: first, the omnipresent tariff concerns, and second, because Intel has reserved (again!) Thunderbolt 5 as a discrete add-on component, making it the domain of high-end, premium laptops, and not the mainstream. Eventually, that will change. But Plugable gives you tomorrow’s hardware at today’s prices. Plugable’s docking station offers the choice of three displays (or two plus an external SSD), Thunderbolt Share, and a general overall stability that unfortunately isn’t that commonplace. I think it’s the best overall docking station I tested, even though others had standout features that I ranked highly. –Mark Hachman Data breaches keep piling up. So too attacks via phishing links and malware. AI may be helping people with dinner recipes and email writing, but it has also sped up the discovery of vulnerabilities—and exploits of them. Even with good online browsing habits, the most careful person can still fall prey to common tricks. You need a safety net. That’s why we love Norton 360 Deluxe. You could stitch together your own equivalent suite yourself, but this antivirus app pulls together and simplifies a very broad range of features for users. In addition to blocking malware and shady websites, Norton 360 Deluxe also offers dark web monitoring, a VPN, parental controls, a password manager, and 50GB of cloud storage for automated backups of critical documents. The subscription even includes general PC utilities like file cleanup, too. This highly comprehensive level of defense is rare—especially given how little Norton charges. You’ll be hard-pressed to find rivals that cost as little or provide as many features. -Alaina Yee Willis Lai / IDG If you want a solid, affordable handheld gaming PC…just get Valve’s Steam Deck. It’s nearly four years old now, but with a starting price of $400 and a “sweet spot” OLED upgrade at $550, it’s still the best option out there for most gamers (especially if you pair the Steam Deck with a GeForce Now subscription, an utterly transformative duo). SteamOS, smoother and better integrated than Windows 11, is a big part of that. If you want a little more gaming power or a bigger screen, the Legion Go S comes with a SteamOS option that doesn’t require any tweaking…but maybe wait for a sale. –Michael Crider For those who want a lot more oomph and options, and don’t mind paying for it, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 is our pick. This beast of a handheld includes the larger screen and Switch-style breakaway controllers of the original design, plus an OLED upgrade and screaming Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It runs Windows 11, but Bazzite is a Steam-powered option (and probably official SteamOS, later). Just be prepared to pay for it: this thing starts at $1350 USD. –Michael Crider Not only did the Alienware 16X Aurora impress us with its raw performance, but its high refresh rate display also makes everything look positively delicious. This laptop is equipped to keep up with the latest titles thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and RTX 5070 GPU. You can jump straight into the latest triple-A games without problem, with all the eye candy cranked, and they’ll play amazing. The 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS screen is crisp and big, and the 240Hz refresh rate makes every frame feel as smooth as silk. -Ashley Biancuzzo You might be surprised how much of your personal data is being collected and sold online. Data brokers and people search sites are hoovering up your data at an alarming rate and it’s nearly impossible to keep a lid on it yourself. So the best solution is to let a personal data removal service handle the arduous task of removing this data for you. And none are doing it better than Incogni. The service is dead simple to use, and the set-it-and-forget-it automation begins to work in a flash. After only the first day of using it, Incogni had already sent out hundreds of removal requests on my behalf, saving me months’ worth of effort. Plus, the service regularly follows up with every site to ensure my data doesn’t ever reappear. The addition of Custom removals means there is practically no site that Incogni won’t attempt to wipe your data from either. It can be a bit expensive, but if you’re concerned about your personal data being shared online, the piece of mind Incogni offers is unparalleled. –Sam Singleton For a gaming monitor to even warrant consideration, it needs to be fast and it needs to have a damn good picture. Those are just table stakes, which the MSI MPG 272URX delivers handily. Not content with the standard 1440p resolution, the 272URX goes full 4K for maximum clarity, and its 240Hz refresh rate renders even fast-paced games with buttery smoothness. Adaptive sync support is a given. But lest you think the 272URX’s talents begin and end with gaming, consider this: generous connectivity, including four video inputs, Power Delivery, and a KVM switch; a full complement of image-quality adjustments via a user-friendly on-screen menu; and HDR support. In sum, it’s an all-around winner. – Katherine Stevenson When it comes to Chromebooks, the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 is damned near flawless. It’s got an Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, so it’s zippy when running everyday tasks, and the 14-inch 1080p touchscreen display looks sharp whether you’re cranking on daily workflows or zoning out to YouTube. It’ll also last around 13 hours on a single charge. You’ll get through a full workday, no problem – and with how great the keyboard feels, you won’t have any complaints while doing so. -Ashley Biancuzzo I am so glad I picked eMeet’s Piko+ 4K for our best webcam of 2025: the only flaw that I could find with this cute little 4K webcam is that it lacked a traditional webcam mount. Imagine my surprise when I double-checked my review and our shopping listings, only to discover that eMeet now ships a “traditional” version of this webcam, too! I absolutely loved the clarity that this dual-lens 4K webcam offered, especially in low light. This webcam’s visual capabilities were simply excellent (the mic is merely average, but that’s okay) and the $90 price splits the difference between our $40 budget webcams and the $150-$250 you’d pay for an ultrapremium offering. I wasn’t expecting much from this webcam, but I was blown away by what it offers. –Mark Hachman It’s never easy to select the best VPN overall. There are so many factors to consider such as privacy, ease of use, server network size, unblocking capabilities, and speed. The reasons people have for using a VPN varies widely and that all needs to be taken into account. Will the VPN be used to get around country blocks for streaming, staying anonymous online, torrenting, or something else—the list goes on and on. Many VPNs excel at a few of these functions, but rarely manage to shine across the board. That is, except NordVPN. It’s one of the only services that consistently ranks at the top, or close to it, of each category. That’s why it’s my pick for this year’s best VPN. Not only does it continue to be the fastest VPN I’ve ever tested, but it has a huge server network, a vast array of security extras, and its no-logs policy is backed by plenty of independent audits. It also never fails to unblock streaming services and fully supports P2P. No other current service exemplifies all of the elements of a great VPN like NordVPN, full stop. –Sam Singleton Each time I review Surfshark I’m amazed at the new and interesting features it adds to the service while maintaining such an inexpensive subscription price. At this point, I find myself asking, what doesn’t Surfshark have? Not only do you get the VPN with an outstanding server network and lightning-fast speeds, but you also have access to a whole slew of top-notch privacy and security extras such as multi-hop, antivirus protection, rotating IP, ad- and tracker-blocking, and more. The best part is that all of these great features and tools can be had for less than the price of a cup of coffee every month with Surfshark’s long-term plans. Even shady off-brand VPNs that market themselves as “cheap” barely offer subscriptions for this price—and none of them have the feature set or verified privacy record of Surfshark. It’s by far the best value VPN for those on a budget—and one of the best VPNs overall. –Sam Singleton For truly portable storage that can be carried with ease and used without the need for any additional cables or adapters, look no further than the Teamgroup X2 Max USB stick. This USB 3.2 Gen2 drive uses NVMe internals to deliver sustained transfers of approximately 1.1GBps. Sure, you can find portable drives that are even faster than that – USB 3.2×2 or USB4, for example. But they won’t feature this lil’ one’s unique flexibility in the form of dual connectors. With both USB-A and USB-C connectors, one on each end, you are assured of being able to plug into any device as-is. Now that’s convenience! – Katherine Stevenson This year, things got interesting in the backup software space. Our long-time favorite backup program was knocked from its perch by EaseUS Todo Backup 2025, which made impressive strides to achieve what our reviewer dubbed “the most efficient workflow I’ve seen.” He also described the interface as “a joy.” Wow. These are the kind of superlatives that make the tedious chore of backing up data much more welcoming. Of course, EaseUS Todo Backup 2025 provides all the necessary functionality you need for complete confidence: whole drive and partition imaging, file and folder backup, sync, disaster recovery including a WinPE recover disk, and more. We also love that EaseUS bucks the trend by offering a perpetual licence ($59.99, or $79.99 for lifetime upgrades) in addition to a yearly subscription ($39.99). Although, to take advantage of EaseUS’s optional cloud storage at a respectable $20 per year for 1TB, you will need to opt for the subscription tier. – Katherine Stevenson It makes a lot of sense to use an online backup service. In the context of the trusty 3-2-1 rule for backups, an online backup suffices as one of the two distinct types of media that’s suggested, as well as checks the box that a backup be kept in a remote location. What’s really great about iDrive, our pick for best online backup service, is that it offers even more than that, such as a client for local backups and basic imaging and disaster recovery, which is pretty rare among online services. The Personal tier, which starts at $69.65 per year, has support for multiple devices and includes 5TB of online storage. With its comprehensive feature set and user-friendliness, iDrive is tough to beat. – Katherine Stevenson Most USB-C hubs are dongles: you get a long rectangular slab of plastic or aluminum about the length of a utility knife, with a number of ports attached. OWC’s Travel Dock looks a bit more like a docking station without the size of a docking station. It’s only 3.2 inches on a side, and ports sprout from all three sides of this 5-in-1 hub: USB-A, Ethernet, USB-C power input, HDMI, and an SD card reader. Even the cord tucks away. For about $35 ($30 as I write this) you get the most important four ports you’ll need, all in a compact little square that still fits inside a pouch, purse, or pack. Or…perhaps a stocking? –Mark Hachman Brad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

Title: Southern California’s Main Street economy rattled by inflation, ICE raids and tariffs

Evidence of economic pain is rippling across Southern California, hitting businesses big and small. Until last month, Simon Yoon ran a popular sushi restaurant tucked away in a Diamond Bar strip center where commuters often stopped to pick up a bite to eat while waiting out the rush hour congestion at the nearby 57 and 60 freeway interchange. Yoon shuttered his restaurant, Fusion 2 Any 1, because he could no longer make ends meet due to a wave of policy decisions to remake the economy by President Donald Trump, who’s just under a year in office now. Yoon said he could no longer afford the $14,000 monthly rent and rising expenses caused by tariffs that tripled the price of everything from a box of chopsticks and a bag of garlic to plastic knives, forks and avocados. “I couldn’t raise my prices to the consumers,” said Yoon, who didn’t want to push away his regulars. “I cut lots of labor.” Also see: Economy shows ‘resilience’ despite ‘thorny issues,’ CSUF economists say He also blamed the drop-off in customers on raids and tactics used in recent weeks by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Diamond Bar, which created a climate of fear in the community. “It’s hurting a lot of business,” Yoon said. “Catching criminals is great, but not everyone is a criminal. There are a lot of hard-working people that are having their families broken up. That’s sad to see.” The 48-year-old Yoon voted for Trump a year ago but now regrets it. “I’m hoping for the best, but nobody comes out to eat,” he said. Yoon isn’t the only business owner barely making ends meet these days. Businesses across Southern California have shed thousands of workers amid a slowing economy, many citing similar reasons to Yoon’s — stretching from Anaheim to Ontario and Pasadena. On Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003. California saw 158,734 people laid off from Jan. 1-Oct. 31, up 16% over last year’s 136,661 — the second-largest employment cuts nationwide, according to the outplacement firm. Cuts in federal funding — fueled by the longest-running federal government shutdown, now at 40 days — also are having their effects. Tariff wars with foreign nations over imports have rattled local businesses, as some are struggling with inflation and labor issues. Cal State University Fullerton economists Anil Puri and Mira Farka and other economists with UCLA Anderson and Beacon Economics recently delivered cautionary forecasts on the state of the economy. Underscoring the concerns, the CSUF economists said that inflation is expected to likely continue to “edge higher into the first quarter of next year,” though they do not expect it to get out of hand, anticipating a peak of around 3.5%.” They added that inflation has “yet to crest,” and “the labor market has yet to find its floor — though neither is expected to inflict as much pain as once feared.” The current annual inflation rate for the U.S. was 3% for the year period ending in September. New inflation statistics published by the regional Consumer Price Indexes for September show an 3.5% inflation rate for Los Angeles and Orange counties. That’s the biggest cost-of-living bump in 16 months. The economists said they wouldn’t be surprised if the remainder of the year is marked by “a few more bumps, with payrolls weakening further as firms await clarity on trade deals, the government shutdown and overall consumer demand.” Layoffs in the region have picked up from a year ago, according to the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal agency that keeps track of jobs data. The BLS paused updates during the government’s shutdown that began Oct. 1. In August, the unemployment rate in Orange County stood at 4.6%, down from a revised 4.8% in July 2025, but above the year-ago estimate of 4.5%. Similar unemployment trends were reported in Los Angeles County (6.3% in August), Riverside County (6.1%) and San Bernardino County (6.1%). Puri and Farka said people should brace for sticker shock when the government reopens, revising figures on job losses and “alarming” hiring conditions. In the past month, Anaheim theme park Disneyland laid off 100 salaried employees as Orange County’s largest employer recalibrates its business ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season. Amazon also is cutting 760 jobs in Southern California — 333 in Irvine — beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence, and Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties laid off 81 people as it shutters Melody Health, its primary care practice, due to federal budget cuts. Other layoffs in October: Some companies even feel the time is ripe to sell. In August, Las Vegas-based Silver State HVAC, Refrigeration & Plumbing acquired The Whitman Co. in Anaheim. “We wanted to avoid a fire sale,” said Linda Whitman, manager of the business and married to owner Fred Whitman, who pointed to the rising cost of doing business in California and plans to retire while the going was good. She said profit margins were shrinking due to the rising prices of commercial-grade heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems since the pandemic when supplies tightened, plus challenges emerging in the past year with tariffs. “We sold primarily for retirement purposes, but it also was driven by what you’ve heard a million times. It’s getting impossible to run a business in California,” Whitman said. “It’s hard to sustain that when costs for workers’ compensation and liability insurance are going up 25% year-over-year, in addition to labor costs and everything else. “One of our big customers is a chain restaurant, and they have been struggling, and that of course affects us,” said Whitman, whose company has avoided layoffs by cutting back hours during certain times of the year. “If we weren’t going to be retiring, it would have been for all the other reasons that we might sell. Our sales have been increasing, but our profitability has not.” In Ontario, local shopkeepers are also worried about the economy. In May 2024, Javier Barajas and his wife, Tania Mangas, took over the Tortas Ahogadas Chapala restaurant in downtown Ontario along G Street. It’s located in a strip center across the street from the popular El Pescador Mexican restaurant along Euclid Avenue — which was packed on Tuesday with a lunchtime crowd of city probation officers and office workers. “People are scared,” said Barajas of the ICE raids. Also see: Inland Empire ICE detainees include gardeners, students, fathers Recent ICE operations in Ontario have dampened dining out and shopping. Business owners interviewed cited high-profile incidents like a landscaper being detained inside a surgical center in July, and a shooting during a vehicle stop in October. Other incidents include the taking into custody of at least three people at a Stater Bros. Markets along Holt Boulevard and arrests of gardeners. Tariffs have not treated Barajas very well, as the price for meats added to Mexican dishes have doubled. On Tuesday, there were a handful of customers eating at the restaurant — which he says was busier before the raids began in the community this past summer. For instance, he said, a chuck roll — a large boneless cut of beef from the shoulder of the cow — shot to $7.50 from $3.80 a pound last year, while a pound of ranchera meat — a higher premium type of beef cut, most commonly used in Mexican dishes like carne asada — jumped to $10.50 from $7 a pound. He says beef prices are up because tariffs have led to higher overhead costs for feed, fuel and labor that have contributed to higher prices consumers see at the grocery store and in their bills at restaurants — like at his. “It’s super hard to make money. I spend all of my money on the restaurant,” said Barajas, who has posted a “help wanted” sign on his restaurant’s front door to fill a cook opening. At the JROD Insurance Agency just south of El Pescador, owner Jesse Rodriguez said that his business is barely getting by. “We used to get walk-in business every time the Route 66 car show was held in Ontario. I didn’t get one customer this time,” said Rodriguez of the 12th annual Route 66 Cruisin’ Reunion that roared into downtown Ontario on Sept. 19. “There’s a slowdown everywhere here in town.” Andres Torres, co-owner of Mission Furniture along Euclid, said that he saw furniture sales climb in the early days of the pandemic when everyone was locked down in their homes and shopping online. Sales have since tapered off, and profits have narrowed in line with a slowing economy he saw before Trump’s election. But another slowdown has emerged with Trump administration-imposed tariffs on Vietnam and China, causing furniture prices to edge up 5-10%, Torres said. “It’s tough, but I’m looking to the future to get ahead of the curve,” said Torres of development projects for housing and more potential shoppers coming in Ontario’s downtown area. “Our intention is to survive this, but the ICE raids don’t help.” Diamond Bar’s Yoon might be temporarily down, but he’s come up with a survival plan for his business. He recently took an offer from a business colleague to open his restaurant in a section of the Gangnam Korean BBQ along Golden Springs Drive, across the street from the Diamond Bar Golf Course. If Yoon can turn his sushi-take out spot profitable, he may end up owning the new restaurant within Gangnam, and begin paying rent to its owner. For now, however, he’s content with managing the bar and restaurant in half the space of his old one a mile away. “I don’t want to leave at the bottom because I did so much for the community,” he said. “I want to go on for a few more years.”

For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia. Also Read | Artificial intelligence’s next home: your eyes Labour rebalanceIn the recent quarter, Amazon reported a $1.8 billion pre-tax charge for severance related to planned job cuts, reflecting one of its largest corporate restructurings in years. The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

In physical retail, Amazon is scaling back its direct grocery experiment. The company said it was closing all 14 Amazon Fresh stores in the UK, signalling a retreat from a model that failed to gain traction. The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027.

The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027. All these challenges will test the sustainability of Amazon’s business bets. www.howindialives.com is a database and search engine for public data Correcting for covid-era overhiring is not the only reset Amazon is undertaking.
