The company had around 228,000 employees worldwide as of June, it says, meaning more than 6,500 could be affected by the cuts. It would be one of the company’s largest staff reductions since it cut 10,000 people in 2023. A Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” In April, Microsoft reported a solid quarter of $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 18%), which was even better than analysts expected. Even so, this new round of layoffs is expected to hit all levels, locations, and teams. The company also had layoffs back in January, though it said those were performance-based. This fresh round of layoffs is not performance-related, a spokesperson told CNBC. Thousands upon thousands of workers have been laid off from Big Tech companies in just the past year.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn’t tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. “How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?” Nadella said. “At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don’t keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.” On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs

Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it’s laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people — making it the company’s largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of “organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” (What, not “vibrant” or “robust”?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), and Google (GOOGL-1.57%) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called “year of efficiency,” and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google’s parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM-0.74%), Spotify (SPOT+5.12%), and Lyft (LYFT-1.87%) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to “focus on the core,” often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers’ group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday’s move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative.

Title: 4 Side Gigs Earn Up To $30k Annual Income For Full-Time Workers

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Side hustles are no longer optional in today's economy. Many American full-time workers need ... More lucrative side gigs like these to keep up with rising costs. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today’s tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn’t really extra anymore, that it’s a necessity for many of today’s workers. “For many Americans, side hustles aren’t optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.” Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. “And with Trump’s tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,” she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they’re willing to dedicate five-to–10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they’re involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren’t worth it, you’re wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that’s over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: “Good writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,” Morgan insists. “The ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.” She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. “You don’t need many clients to get started,” Morgan notes. “Just offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it’s a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.” Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. “On platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it’s simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people’s stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.” “If you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,” Morgan recommends. “After one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‘a gift for a colleague’ or ‘greenery on the desktop.’ She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ”It takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. “From there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.” Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. “These sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,” she explains. “You can get $50 to $250 per participation.” She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. “To get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,” she advises. “Even if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that’s already $200-300.” SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you’re tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming — with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn “went more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‘here’s our big, splashy new content program,’” said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. “It was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of … There’s a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.” Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. “What was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,” said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn’s ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. “Business influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.” But it’s the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers — certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). “I think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing — the larger monetary commitment,” said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. “With more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we’re seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways — it’s what the buzz is all about … The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we’re going to see the shift.” “There’s a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,” said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets — yet. “Brands in a budget pinch are … really just trying to figure out where’s my biggest bang for my buck.” To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size — some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: “As media buyers, we’re really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they’re doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we’re watching TV,” Basis Technologies’ Freed said. “CTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it’s shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,” said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. “There’s definitely an appeal to that. It’s obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.” Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can’t be forgotten — just like they offer the lion’s share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it’s a more even playing field than ever. “This one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone’s getting connected through the pipeline,” said Jellyfish’s Dahir. “The digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we’re not able to in the past.” For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. “If I’m watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,” noted Dahir. “This creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports … I’m curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback … because there’s too many touch points that you can tag it.” And that’s where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there’s a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. “One theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it’s more about the curation of content and context,” said the buyer on background. “It’s making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier — when done right.” Added Basis Technologies’ Freed: “For buyers, it’s easier because we have more control — we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.” Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy — but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here’s the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): “It’s just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‘I’m going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.’ And they’re going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.” In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers. As uncertainty remains, we look at some different predictions and their impacts. The software giant is contacting media buyers informing them it will close in February 2026.

Title: Big Layoffs Are Hitting These Sectors The Hardest
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/05/10/big-layoffs-are-hitting-these-sectors-the-hardest/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T21:16:59Z

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Depressed businesswoman getting laid off from her job, talking to her colleagues while carrying her ... More belongings and leaving the job. Layoffs have surged across an array of industries. Some of the problems are caused by a volatile economic landscape. President Trump’s initial tariff policy put a scare into both corporate executives and consumers. Additionally, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, are changing the workplace. Corporate restructurings due to changing circumstances added to the trend of layoffs. With more than 221,812 jobs eliminated in the first months of the year, workers and companies alike are forced to confront an ever changing challenging environment. Layoffs in 2025 are reshaping the workforce. Government, tech, retail, accounting, manufacturing, and logistics have been dealing with the biggest cuts. Driven by tariffs, cost-cutting, AI adoption, and federal downsizing, these layoffs show a shift in the economy. For workers, they’ll need to stay proactive with upskilling, networking, and building financial resilience to navigate this storm. The layoff wave has spared few industries. Some sectors have borne the brunt more than others. Approximately one-third of layoffs stem from the government sector or related industries. Driven by federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration, agencies like the National Park Service (1,500 layoffs), U.S. Geological Survey (1,000), and the Bureau of Reclamation (100–150) are implementing significant reductions in force (RIFs). Tech The tech sector has the dubious honor of leading in layoffs, per TechCrunch. Over 23,400 jobs were cut in April alone. Companies like CrowdStrike (500 layoffs), Meta, Microsoft, and Block are downsizing. By comparison, 2024 saw 150,000 tech job cuts across 549 firms. High-profile firms like Amazon, Google, and Tesla also contributed to the tally. According to layoffs.fyi, 52,340 tech employees were laid off from around 123 tech companies. There were roughly 61,296 gov’t employees laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiatives, and about 171,843 total federal departures in 2025. U.S. retailers eliminated over 64,000 jobs in the first four months of 2025. This made the retail sector the second-hardest-hit industry after technology and ahead of most other consumer-facing industries, reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Bankruptcies at Joann Fabrics (19,000 jobs), Party City (16,000), and Big Lots (1,000) account for significant losses, with other retailers cutting jobs to brace for economic pressures like tariffs. Big Four management consultancy PwC laid off 1,500 U.S. workers (2% of its workforce), following 1,800 cuts in 2024. Other similar firms such as KPMG, EY, and Deloitte have also announced layoffs, citing low attrition and pressure on profit margins. Companies like Volvo (125 layoffs at its Charleston plant), General Motors (1,695 at its Fairfax Assembly plant), and Mercedes-Benz have announced mass layoffs. These cuts are tied to production pauses and cost-cutting amid economic uncertainty. UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs in 2025, citing global trade policy changes and tariffs that discourage shipping. Trucking and retail are also expected to face mass layoffs due to tariff-driven economic pressures. The Trump administration’s tariffs are disrupting supply chains and raising costs, particularly in retail, logistics, and manufacturing. UPS explicitly cited “changes in global trade policy” as a driver for its 20,000 job cuts. Economists warn that tariffs could trigger stagflation or a recession, further pressuring companies to downsize. Many companies are streamlining operations to boost efficiency or profitability. CrowdStrike’s 5% workforce reduction aims to achieve a $10 billion annual recurring revenue target, while PwC’s layoffs address low attrition and bottom-line pressures. Tech firms are cutting middle managers and embracing AI-driven or self-led teams. The rise of AI and automation is displacing jobs, particularly in tech and manufacturing. Retail giants like Joann Fabrics and Party City faced bankruptcies, leading to massive layoffs. Even surviving retailers like Big Lots are cutting jobs to stabilize finances. The Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal government has led to mass firings and hiring freezes, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially issuing but later revoking some layoff notices. This creates uncertainty for federal workers. What Should Workers Know About Layoffs Here’s what you need to know and what to do. Monitor your sector for signs of instability. Retail and tech workers should be vigilant, given their high layoff rates. Federal employees need to track policy changes, as further RIFs are expected. Resources like WARNTracker.com and Layoffs.fyi provide real-time data on announced layoffs. In tech, generic skills won’t cut it. Identify niche skills your employer or competitors lack. This includes AI tools. If your company doesn’t offer it, invest in training to keep current and ahead of the pack. For retail or manufacturing workers, cross-training in adjacent roles like logistics or e-commerce. Continuous learning is a non-negotiable, as you don’t want to be left behind. Layoffs often come with little warning. Severance packages may be minimal or not offered. Put aside an emergency fund that can last at least around 6–12 months of living expenses in savings. Don’t feel it’s beneath you to take on a side hustle to bring home some much needed money. Start networking. Relationships can open doors to new opportunities. Engage with industry peers on platforms like LinkedIn, attend virtual or in-person events, and reconnect with former colleagues. A strong network can help you land a role before layoffs hit. Layoffs can feel personal, especially when companies like Meta label affected workers as “low performers.” Don’t let it bring you down. Seek advice and support from mentors or career coaches. Reframe a layoff as an opportunity to pivot to a more stable or fulfilling role. To be fair, it’s easy said than done. Tariffs and trade wars are sometimes scapegoats for companies. They may use these trends to conduct firings, pivoting to AI-driven models. The tech sector’s volatility, for instance, isn’t solely about innovation. The tech sector misjudged the market and overhired during the pandemic boom. Now companies are paying for it by over-correcting to appease shareholders. Workers should be skeptical of corporate narratives. When companies cite “low attrition” as a layoff rationale, it’s often code for protecting profits over people. Similarly, the “low performer” label at Meta looks like a tactic to deflect blame from poor strategic planning. The real risk for workers isn’t just losing a job. It’s being left behind in an economy increasingly prioritizing automation. On the flip side, this chaos presents opportunities. Sectors like healthcare and transportation are adding jobs, and remote work remains a viable path in tech. Workers who adapt by mastering high-demand skills, building personal brands, or exploring entrepreneurial ventures can thrive despite the uncertainty. The key is self-leadership. Keep your eyes open for opportunities. Don’t wait for employers to dictate your future.

Title: Intel's distributed manufacturing might have given it a lifeline

Let’s be honest — Intel has been down in the dumps lately. Between the awful Raptor Lake instability scandal, disappointing Arrow Lake launch, canceling the much-hyped 20A node, and waves of layoffs, the chipmaker seems stuck playing defense. Intel's stock price hasn't recovered from the massive drop, and AMD continues to rack up wins. Even Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, publicly acknowledged the myriad of challenges the company is facing. What you might have missed, however, is that Intel has been nurturing a long-term manufacturing pivot to redefine its role in the global semiconductor ecosystem. Possible tariffs on semiconductor chips from outside the U.S. are only the latest incentive for Intel to increase local manufacturing. With billions invested in both domestic and international fab expansion, and a resurgent foundry business, Intel is trying to become the top player in a world that cares a lot more about where the chips are coming from. It won't be easy, but it's necessary In case you didn't know, Intel holds the most U.S.-based manufacturing plants among chipmakers, which could be a huge shield against new semiconductor tariffs in the near future. Once the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, Intel, for the first time, outsourced the manufacturing of a major CPU lineup to TSMC. Intel's in-house foundry failed to meet expectations, and it was forced to use TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes. Thanks to the $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding by the government, Intel has received the green light to invest in projects across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The CHIPS Act funds alone aren't nearly enough, but that hasn't stopped Intel from pouring $32 billion into two new fabs in Arizona, around $3.5 billion into advanced packaging plants in New Mexico, and $28 billion into two new fabs in Ohio (production is delayed to 2030, though). Even Oregon is getting a 300mm foundry plant. If the Trump administration goes through with additional tariffs on non-U.S. chips, Intel's domestic manufacturing capabilities could prove to be a strong moat. Almost every company outsources its chip manufacturing to TSMC, Samsung, and other Asian fabs, so Intel's strong domestic base can be one of the key levers in its gradual revival. The company is clearly betting big on expanding domestic operations; it's not a half-baked strategy anymore. I certainly don't. Intel isn't just hoping to get its home affairs in order; its overseas expansion is also ramping up. In 2024, its long-awaited Fab 34 joint venture in Ireland began ramping up production using the Intel 4 (its first EUV-based node) and Intel 3 process nodes. In Israel, Intel invested around $25 billion to build Fab 38 after a $3.2 billion subsidy from the Israeli government. Poland also greenlit $1.9 billion in state support last year for Intel's new $4.6 billion plant. Even in Germany, Intel plans to invest over $30 billion in two fabs, supported by $10.7 billion in government subsidies under the European Chips Act. These international fabs aren't just for capacity expansion but also geopolitical hedging in an increasingly unpredictable landscape. Although some of these projects have been delayed, the increasing willingness of several countries to subsidize Intel's global expansion shows their commitment to reducing reliance on the likes of TSMC and Samsung. This distributed manufacturing model could help Intel sidestep future supply chain bottlenecks and regional disruptions, like we saw during the pandemic and the recent Taiwan earthquakes. Intel has outlined its new processes for the next few years, but what does it all mean? A big piece of Intel’s pivot is its foundry business — and it’s finally gaining traction. At Intel’s 2024 Foundry Direct Connect event, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had already signed several customers for its upcoming 18A process. The list now includes names like Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Qualcomm, and defense contractors Trusted Semiconductor Solutions and Reliable MicroSystems. Intel had also announced a collaboration with Arm to produce its SoCs using the 18A process node. And most recently, Intel and TSMC agreed to enter into a joint venture whereby the latter would own 20% of Intel's foundry business. This is a huge vote of confidence in Intel's revitalized process roadmap. It signals that customers are at least willing to bet on Intel again. The company's plan to regain process leadership hinges on the success of 18A as well as future nodes such as 14A. Now structured as a subsidiary, Intel's foundry arm could play a huge role in Team Blue's resurgence. Intel might be on its way to becoming a company that doesn't hoard in-house manufacturing, collaborates with rivals, and treats its fabs as a revenue stream instead of just a moat. An unlikely duo. Intel has been pursuing smart capital, distributed manufacturing, and a resurgent foundry business in a bid to regain process leadership and solve its financial woes. Aided by federal grants, international subsidies for global expansion, and collaborations with the biggest names in the business might just prove to be the push Intel needed to regain its lost sheen.

Title: Companies are going hardcore. It means one classic piece of career advice is getting more crucial.

A few big companies have been in the news for cutting underperformers and rewarding high performers. If you're looking to advance your career or keep your job in an increasingly frozen job market, you should take advantage of the classic advice to document your work wins and accomplishments. Keeping track of your performance can be crucial to getting a raise or a promotion, and for job security. Microsoft and Meta have made performance-related job cuts. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported that "Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers." Emily Field, a partner in McKinsey & Company's people and organizational performance practice, said performance management tends to follow economic and talent cycles. Companies were more relaxed about it during the pandemic and the Great Resignation, when workers were quitting their jobs en masse. But now the Great Resignation is over, hiring has cooled, layoffs are still low, and more workers are staying put. That more static labor market could mean demonstrating your value at work can be even more important to get promoted or to try to protect your role from layoffs. "What we're seeing is, particularly with AI, particularly with economic headwinds, we're seeing organizations say, we need to focus on high performance to be able to win, to be able to innovate, to be able to beat our competitors, and therefore we need to focus on performance management," Field said. Below is advice on how to document your wins, who needs to see them, and how often you should be discussing performance. Amy Lentz, the founder of Hack Your HR and chief people officer of footwear company Toms, said, "If you are creating value in your job, I think it's important to document," Lentz said. "Where people get kind of hung up is, 'Well, what is success and how do I measure it?'" Vicki Salemi, a career expert for Monster, said if a company is figuring out layoffs and their budget, workers need to also think of their job in terms of numbers. "They're thinking about in terms of your wins, but also money saved, time saved as well as money earned, time earned in terms of efficiencies, streamlining," Salemi said. Field said it's always been important to have quantifiable metrics. But in today's economy, "it's even more important to be able to say, this is how I'm contributing to the organization's success." Salemi said not all companies have quantitative performance ratings because they are having ongoing conversations about performance and don't think there needs to be a formal process. "In that case, it may be harder for you to show that you're a strong performer if they don't go by metrics," she said. Salemi said to focus on what you can do to be a good employee, including whether you are hitting or exceeding goals and expectations. If you are worried about layoffs, Salemi said to ask your boss what you need to do differently or what you need to prioritize. "That shows engagement, that shows that you care, and that you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work and hopefully get honest, helpful feedback," Salemi said. "Your boss might say, 'It's the company. It's not you.'" Lentz said documented wins should be measurable, objective, and factual, and less about your perception of that success. She said to document what you did, the outcome, and how it brought value. Salemi said to get in the habit of quantifying what you do because this can also be helpful if you apply for a new job. Salemi added that you can also document work testimonials and feedback you have received. Salemi suggested workers document their success in real time, even if it's just a note on their phones that they can refer back to. However, she advised against showing them to your boss after every success. "You do need to do that periodically and when it matters," Salemi said, adding that a good time to do so is during your organization's review of salaries, after a big project, or overcoming some work hurdles. Lentz suggested making a document that you can add to and share with your boss, arguing that it could be more effective than just tracking everything in a single annual review. Field said setting goals is important for documenting successes. She said to have check-ins with your manager because your priorities and what you need to deliver on might change over time. Lentz suggested asking in your one-on-one meeting with your boss for a conversation in the next few months about goals and how to spend your time, so you can understand if you are working on what is of value at the company. Salemi suggested asking your boss if they have a minute to discuss how to be rated as exceptional at the company this year and what metrics they need to see from you. Salemi said even if your boss isn't numbers-focused, you need to include figures in your documentation because your manager won't be the only one evaluating your performance. She added that it can also be important if you are considering an internal job switch. "The first thing that potential new boss is going to do is they'll want to see your performance review," Salemi said. "It's important to highlight your wins and that means including numbers."

Title: Marx wasn't entirely wrong on the lay of capitalism; he was just early

Karl Marx described a world of two main classes: those who owned the means of production (the bourgeoisie), and those who sold their labor to survive (the proletariat). His vision reflected the industrial world of the 19th century—factories, landlords, and mass labor. Today, we live in a world of startups, social media, and digital nomads. It might seem like 'class' is obsolete. But when we peel back the layers, we find that class, as he saw it, never disappeared — it just changed form. So what counts as ownership today? In Marx's time, ownership meant factories, land, and physical infrastructure. Today, it's code, platforms, patents, and data. The owners are no longer factory tycoons; they are tech moguls. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta don't just sell products — they own the channels through which digital life flows. These platforms are the modern means of production. If you want to reach customers, communicate, work, or learn, you often do it through their systems. This control gives them immense leverage. They extract fees, set rules, harvest data, and shape behavior — not just through economics, but through algorithmic influence. They don't just benefit from the market — they define it. It’s true that anyone can start a business today. Anyone can code, freelance, or build an audience. And some people do rise: Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others began with modest means and built empires. But these are rare stories. Most founders fail. Most people lack the capital, networks, and insulation to survive repeated failure. Success often comes not from a single stroke of genius but from persistence, timing, and the ability to fail safely. In other words, the field may appear open, but it isn’t level. A few make it. Many don’t. And even among those who “succeed,” control often passes to the investors and platform owners behind the curtain. The modern ladder still exists — but it’s taller, slipperier, and guarded by gatekeepers with venture capital. If Marx's class model still applies, how do we translate it to today? The bourgeoisie are now the platform owners: the founders, VCs, and institutional investors who control the infrastructure. The petty bourgeoisie are creators, startup founders, and engineers with some equity. They have partial control, but they’re vulnerable to policy shifts and market forces. The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass—spam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they’re governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn’t disappeared — it’s been digitized. The so-called “tech middle class” is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don’t control. A change in TikTok’s algorithm, YouTube’s payout structure, or Apple’s App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old — shopkeepers, artisans, and traders — they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx’s time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality — though now dressed in tech jargon — is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We’re no longer marching on factory floors. We’re negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn’t foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production—whether they’re factories or platforms — they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don’t need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn’t about who’s rich and who’s not. It’s about who controls the systems. Most of us still don’t. Until we do, Marx isn’t irrelevant — he’s just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field.
