Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.

Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's Gemini suite as well. At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance. Razr Ultra: Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera.

With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, similar to the Razr Plus 2024. It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99. Razr 2025: As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky. The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen.

Along with its clamshells, the company also launched the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer. Read more here Alphabet, Google's parent company, released its Q1 earnings on Thursday (April 24), and it was reported that the company's revenue saw a 12% hike year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed later that evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion. Google's core businesses, including Search, YouTube advertising, and AI, were sizable contributors to this overall growth. "We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai Google's Search also saw a gain of $50.7 billion in revenue, YouTube's advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company, and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion. And Google Cloud also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. During the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products, specifically AI Overviews. Read more here Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said. These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added. Employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, were among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well. They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged." Read more here A new rumor suggests that Samsung could be taking its mid-year Unpacked event to New York. According to a Korean news site, The JoongAng Daily, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with its new set of foldables, Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July. NYC could allegedly be playing host after three long years. The last time an Unpacked event was held in the location was back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. An industry insider familiar with Samsung's plan told the publication that, "This time, it will be held again in New York, the most representative cultural city, after three years." There is speculation that the Korean OEM could be switching things up to prioritize the U.S. market. Read more here Earlier this week, Google rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support. The latest update didn't bring any significant changes, as Google is gearing up to launch the stable version of its OS this summer. Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, which fixes two bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. It fixes a weird battery drain, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also tends to certain system stability issues and random launcher crashes that some folks were dealing with. However, a few Pixel users have taken to Reddit to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on: Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

Title: Special Report: We Are Being Warned That There Will Be Empty Shelves Throughout The U.S. “Starting In A Couple Of Weeks”

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Experts are telling us that the supply chain disruptions that we are facing are likely to be more severe than anything that we witnessed during the last pandemic. Anyone that believes that we can easily replace 438 billion dollars of imports from China is just being delusional. There are thousands of products that are made in China that are simply not made anywhere else. Yes, we will do what we can to mitigate the damage, but there is only so much that we can do. I just heard from one business owner that has already received numerous price increase notifications from his suppliers. And apparently there are already hundreds of products on Amazon that have had their prices raised substantially… Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys. In many other cases, products that are manufactured in China will no longer be coming to the United States at all. In fact, President Trump is even admitting that most Chinese businesses “won’t do any business here” as long as tariff rates remain this high… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that no one thinks the current status quo with China is sustainable. The president was asked by Time if he agrees with that sentiment. “Oh I agree,” Mr. Trump responded. He said China “won’t do any business here, because at 145%, it’s going to be very rare that you see business.” Nobody can deny that President Trump is quite correct about this, and the numbers that we are already seeing are quite staggering. For example, it is being reported that the “volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%”… US businesses began scaling back or canceling orders as President Trump ratcheted up the trade war with Beijing after returning to the White House. The volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%, compared to the same period last year, according to container-tracking software provider Vizion. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Container bookings for shipments from China to the United States dropped by a staggering 64 percent during the first week of April compared to the previous week… The drop in predicted arrivals at Los Angeles follows reports from data provider Vizion of a “crash” in container bookings in April. For shipments from China to the US, bookings fell 64pc in the first week of the month compared to the previous week. Analysts blamed the crash on importers who were cancelling shipments to “reassess costs, timelines, and broader trade strategy”. This is leaving more container ships half-empty – and prompting more shipping companies to cancel voyages in a bid to reduce losses and stop fees plummeting. Imagine a truck that is speeding along at 70 miles per hour and someone slams the brakes all the way to the floor. That is essentially what we are facing. FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller is warning that trucking activity out of the L.A. area is likely to drop 50 percent and we are likely to see “massive layoffs”… Year-over-year trucking activity out of Los Angeles down 23%. It will likely drop to 50% in the coming weeks if there isn’t trade war resolution. Massive layoffs coming to the West Coast trucking sector The bottom line is that a lot less stuff is going to be coming to our stores. In fact, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council is convinced that “starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff”… Some of the products likeliest to go missing from store shelves in the coming months will be lower-cost footwear, apparel, toys and electronics, for which manufacturing is heavily concentrated in China, Gold said. Other perishable items coming from China, like apple juice and fish, have limited shelf lives and were more difficult for retailers to stockpile. “Like back during Covid where we had shortages of toilet paper, we are going to start seeing that in more and more goods,” said Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff, and if the administration waits to resolve the problem until we have shortages and hoarding, that is just too late.” His assessment was echoed by an expert that was interviewed by the New York Post… China accounts for about 54% of all US containerized imports from Asia – from electronics, toys, apparel, furniture and building materials. It generally takes two to three weeks to make the journey from China to the West Coast ports. “Things that can’t be inventoried, you’ll see (shortages) in a matter of weeks, maybe not even months,” Rita McGrath, strategic management scholar and professor at Columbia Business School, told The Post. And the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot essentially told President Trump the same thing… Earlier this week, America’s most powerful retail executives trooped into the White House to deliver a blunt prognosis: tariffs on Chinese goods risked causing “empty shelves” in two weeks without a change of course. The three companies who attended the meeting – Walmart, Target and Home Depot – are among the most exposed to the president’s policies, which include tariffs of up to 145pc on Chinese goods and higher port fees for Chinese-made vessels. We are heading into a full-blown nightmare. Even if the U.S. and China were to reach a trade deal tomorrow, and that is definitely not going to happen, it would still take an extended period of time before our supply chains returned to normal… Even if Trump were to reduce the tariffs, the disruption caused to the supply chain could take weeks or months to unravel, given the time it takes for ships to across the Pacific and for the other pieces of the supply chain to snap back into place. “You have an eight-week period where volumes are going to crash before they can even come back up, and that’s if things return to normal,” said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight and Analytics. “All this comes at a time of the year when volumes really should start to increase.” For now, it appears that the Chinese are digging in for the long haul. On Friday, we learned that China’s Politburo has decided to implement a plan to assist those that are being impacted by the trade war… In an economic-analysis meeting on Friday, the 24-man Politburo, China’s main decision-making body headed by President Xi Jinping, said authorities would roll out specific plans to support companies and individuals affected by the trade war. They pledged to “coordinate domestic economic work with international economic and trade engagements, resolutely focus on doing our own affairs, steadfastly expand high-level opening up, and focus on stabilizing employment, businesses, markets, and expectations”, according to a meeting readout released by Xinhua. “By enhancing the certainty of high-quality development, we can effectively respond to the uncertainties brought by drastic changes in the external environment,” it said. Here in the United States, those that are getting hammered by the trade war are just going to have to deal with it. This is a really bad time for this to happen. Economic conditions were already starting to slow down, and a major conflict with Iran could erupt at any time. It is often said that when it rains, it pours. It is definitely raining now, and if the U.S. and China cannot reach a deal soon we are going to get absolutely soaked.

Title: It Is The Era Of Great Detachment: Time For A New Management Playbook

ByAnjali Chaudhry ByAnjali Chaudhry, Contributor. Isometric group of businessmen carrying piles of documents in cardboard boxes left the office, ... More unemployment, dismissal, career crisis, economic crisis leading to massive layoffs It’s a precarious time to be a manager in today’s workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been laid off in just weeks—a number not seen since the 2020 recession—due to sweeping efficiency mandates from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The latest workplace trend, dubbed “What did you do last week?”, pushes productivity into short, tangible bursts, leaving little room for meaningful and substantive work. Layered atop this is an unrelenting news cycle filled with tariff wars, geopolitical instability, and economic headwinds. Unsurprisingly, Glassdoor reports the lowest employee confidence index since tracking began in 2016. Gallup data reinforces the sentiment: employee engagement is at a decade low. Experts now call it the era of Great Detachment. Decades of research show that disengagement leads to lower quality work, reduced safety, and decreased profitability. In this climate, managers are in a double bind, between efficiency mandates and employee expectations. On the one hand, they are the foot soldiers having to implement the strident call for efficiency while being constrained by the lack of support or training. On the other hand, they must manage employee expectations that are stuck in the post-pandemic era. One of the very first executive orders terminated remote work arrangements in the federal government. Many businesses across industries including behemoths such as Amazon, JP Morgan, and AT&T followed suit with their own return to office mandates. Yet, employee preferences tell a different story. Remote work preference has jumped from 8% to 33% since 2019. Meanwhile, only 7% now prefer onsite work—down from 60%. These numbers reflect a major disconnect that managers are forced to reconcile, often without tools or autonomy. To answer the pressing questions—How do I motivate employees? How can I encourage innovation amidst uncertainty?—leaders must start by restoring a sense of agency in their teams. Today’s workforce is teeming with diversity—not just in demographics but in terms of what employees want, need, or even expect. The psychological contract between employer and employee is more idiosyncratic than ever making a ‘one-size fit all’ management style a very bad idea. Rather than making unilateral assumptions about what will work, it is time to engage with the employee one-on-one. Having an open and honest dialogue has always been a hallmark of a good manager. For those wondering how, two promising techniques worth investing in are active listening and appreciative enquiry. Active listening calls for demonstrating empathy and genuine interest and thus creating safe space for employees to share what they need to succeed. Appreciative enquiry is about engaging in dialogues that begin with exploring what is working and then, supporting employee to build on it. Being authentic is the key. A week-to-week accountability model creates pressure to convey busyness and deliver quick wins. Managers need to buck the trend for efficiency demands as thus avoid the cycle of “performative productivity” for employees. Instead, empower employees to prioritize meaningful work—activities that drive long-term value even if they don’t yield immediate results. Easier said than done, yes, but prioritizing employee productivity that goes beyond the optics is a win-win as it delivers value for the organization while signaling to employee that their contribution matters. Managers not as a boss but becoming what employees need, want, and expect. Today’s managers are squeezed between the top-down pressures of leadership and the bottom-up expectations of their teams. And yet, their success hinges on how their employee perform. In this new era, traditional management roles no longer suffice. To help employees do well, it behooves managers to transition from being 'Da Boss’ to becoming what employees need. Become an Agile Coach. The AI revolution is reshaping employee skill sets needed for organizations to innovate and stay competitive. Managers should partner with employees to identify gaps and create personalized development plans. This reskilling may call for supporting employees in carving out time for self-training, for sourcing learning opportunities, or connecting them to programs from educational institutions or industry groups. Serve as a Guide and Cheerleader. In environments where layoffs loom, many employees struggle to articulate their value. Be a spokesperson who brings employee challenges and concerns to leadership just as you can help amplify their contributions and offer visibility that go beyond short-term KPIs. Recalibrate Expectations and Model Resilience. Sometimes, tough love is necessary. If teamwork or long-term thinking is being undervalued in today’s ‘what’s in it for me’ mindset, it’s the manager’s job to recalibrate values and re-center collaboration. Employees look to their managers for guidance when there is ambiguity and therefore, modeling behaviors your employees need to thrive may be vital. In these uncertain times, what employee may need the most is a leader who conveys resilience, strength, and positivity. Myth of work-life balance as businessman lay down working at home using laptop and headset for ... More conference call meeting and take care his daughter child playing with cat In today’s always-on world, Employees report being perpetually in a crunch mode with long hours, unrelenting urgency and being constantly checked in. Burnout is rampant, not from lack of time off, but from the inability to truly disconnect. The busyness of work that begins as a badge of honor results significant burnout that chokes individual’s productivity. For a long time, work-life balance was viewed as a panacea. However, in today’s hyper-connected world, the idea of balance is viewed as being unrealistic and can makes things worse by setting unreasonable expectations. So, instead of work-life balance, consider the concept of work-life boundary that makes a case for clear demarcation between work and non-work lives. Boundaries can be time-bound such as the traditional 9 to 5 workday, or psychological, as in checking out mentally from the job demands to focus on personal life or even emotional, that is, a taking a break from the stresses and strain of work demands. Unfortunately, employees often lack the ability or the autonomy to engage in any of these boundary controls. Managers can help. It could mean respecting employee’s preference for personal time, empowering employees to develop a more structured work-life, or modeling behaviors that give autonomy to the employees to take a break from work. Championing and enabling work-life boundary may be key to fostering a culture of well-being where reducing anxiety, burnout, and stress is a priority. A Gallup study of Fortune 500 CHROs revealed a critical blind spot: while most expect their employees to prefer blended work-life models, almost half of the surveyed employee actually prefer clear separation. This mismatch is a silent driver of disengagement—and a unique opportunity for managers to lead differently and win employee trust by giving them autonomy to manage their preference for work-life boundary. Admittedly not all job types allow accommodating employee desire for boundary control. For instance, a 9 to 5 work routine is not an option in healthcare setting but being open and approachable to helping employees figure out strategies for crafting their work arrangement can significantly help support hyper-stressed and over-worked employees. Two decades ago, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard penned Let My People Go Surfing, advocating for flexible time away from work. Despite generous PTO policies, a 2024 Harris Poll found that 75% of U.S. employees don’t use their allotted time off. Why? Pressure to stay connected, fear of job insecurity, and mounting workloads. Today, burnout is at crisis levels. While extended vacations may be impractical during economic downturns, the core idea remains relevant: managers must champion employee well-being to sustain performance. Productivity mandates and efficiency targets may be essential—but they must not come at the cost of human creativity and resilience. Restoring employee agency is not just a feel-good strategy. It’s a competitive advantage. Leaders who listen, advocate, coach, and set boundaries aren’t just surviving the Great Detachment—they're building the kind of workplace where innovation and engagement thrive, even in turbulent times.

Eira is an editor for Mind the Product. She's been a business journalist, editor, and copywriter for longer than she cares to think about. The Washington Post gets cosy with OpenAI, Anthropic underlines its commitment to safety and Intel proposes more layoffs and restructuring, here are the news stories that caught our attention this week. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has partnered with OpenAI to integrate the newspaper's journalism into ChatGPT. ChatGPT now provides users with summaries, quotes, and direct links to original articles from The Washington Post. The newspaper said it continues to be LLM-agnostic and build its own range of AI-powered solutions for both its business and its users. UK AI video generation startup Synthesia is set to launch a new AI agent tool designed to make videos more interactive, according to Sifted. The AI agent will be released in “the first half of this year” and is aimed at improving user engagement by allowing viewers to interact with video content, potentially transforming passive viewing into an active experience. Synthesia also reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April and received a strategic investment from Adobe Ventures. This follows a $180 million funding round in January. Chip maker Intel plans to lay off over 20% of its workforce in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. As Intel reported its Q1 earnings CEO Lip Bu-Tan also sent a message to employees that lays out plans for restructuring and expands the company’s return to office mandate from three days to four. The layoffs are thought to affect about 22,000 staff, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 at the end of 2024. In a bid to assure us of its commitment to transparency and a proactive culture of safety, Anthropic has published a report showing how its Claude AI model has been exploited by malicious actors and which details the company’s efforts to mitigate this misuse. The report, called Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude: March 2025, reports that, for instance: According to Anthropic: “This report outlines several case studies on how actors have misused our models, as well as the steps we have taken to detect and counter such misuse.” The report said that users are starting to use AI frontier models to semi-autonomously orchestrate complex abuse systems that involve many social media bots. The company expects this trend to continue as agentic AI systems improve. It also points out that generative AI can accelerate capability development for less sophisticated actors, potentially allowing them to operate at a level previously only achievable by more technically proficient individuals. Anthropic has been largely commended for its transparency in publishing this report. On LinkedIn for example, commentators praised the company for its commitment to safety.

Title: How Trump altered the government in ways that could benefit himself and his inner circle

Time Published: 2025-04-24T19:16:37Z
Full Content:
After staffing the wealthiest presidential Cabinet in modern American history with energy and banking titans, President Donald Trump has spent his first three months in office boosting those industries while dismantling long-established guardrails against government corruption. A CNN review of Trump’s actions as he approaches the 100-day mark of his presidency found that as his administration has slashed the federal workforce and shaken the global economy with tariffs, the president’s team has made changes that could also directly benefit his Cabinet members or their former companies. At the same time, by gutting traditional oversight bodies and embracing historically lax ethics rules, Trump has enabled conflicts of interest and greased the revolving door between government and the private sector. At least eight nominees for executive branch positions would have been banned or had limited roles under previous administrations – including Trump’s first term – due to their recent work as lobbyists, according to an analysis by the watchdog Campaign Legal Center that was reviewed by CNN. Some potential conflicts have played out in plain view – like when Trump used the White House lawn last month to produce what seemed like an elaborate ad for key adviser and top donor Elon Musk’s struggling Tesla brand. The Trump administration has also cleared the way for Musk’s Starlink business to win new government contracts. But other examples of possible conflicts are found deep in Cabinet members’ ethics reports, such as Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s disclosure that he would receive a million-dollar bonus – after his swearing-in – from the fracking company he founded, led and now plays a role in regulating. Even as they’ve agreed to divest, some Cabinet members have found a loophole: giving control of certain assets to their adult children. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick handed the reins of his financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to his 27-year-old son, while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he would give his interest in litigation against a vaccine maker – part of an industry he is now tasked with regulating – to his adult son. Some of Trump’s policies also could help his own business interests. By establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the president is backstopping the value of the cryptocurrency, enriching existing holders of the asset, some of whom spent millions helping reelect the president. Meanwhile, Trump and his family have moved to expand their own crypto interests. And this week, Trump sent the value of his personal meme coin soaring by promising its top buyers a chance to dine with the president next month. Many of the Trump administration’s early actions have pushed priorities that Republicans have sought for years, and the White House says its moves to slash regulations are needed to reduce spending and eliminate government inefficiency. “The people elected me to do the job, and I’m doing it,” Trump said in March. “My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.” But from cryptocurrency and energy policies to efforts as niche as rural internet access, some of the administration’s moves also closely align with the financial interests of his top advisers and the president himself. “This administration seems entirely indifferent to ethics, and that contrasts certainly with the past several administrations, including Trump one,” said Richard Briffault, a Columbia University law professor who studies government ethics. “The level of complete indifference to it takes us back to before Watergate.” In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress passed sweeping ethics legislation to hold the executive branch more accountable. Within weeks of beginning his second term, Trump flouted many of those decades-old protections – including by firing more than a dozen inspectors general and dismissing the head of the government’s ethics watchdog. He also signed an order making it easier for lobbyists to join agencies overseeing industries they used to represent. The United States has spent years building up an “ethics infrastructure,” Briffault said. “In less than 90 days, this administration has been tearing (it) down.” Trump’s unprecedented moves come as his Cabinet includes some of the richest people to ever hold the reins of power in the federal government. Many came straight from positions of power in key industries. CNN analyzed dozens of financial disclosures and ethics statements filed by presidential appointees to track the wealth and potential conflicts of interest among Trump’s Cabinet members. The disclosures offer a limited picture of nominees’ finances: Officials are only required to list their assets in broad ranges. Still, Trump’s leadership team appears to eclipse the wealth of any previous Cabinet going back decades. Of 21 Cabinet members, seven reported holding at least $10 million in assets, and some are even billionaires. Lutnick – who has been a Wall Street power player since the mid-1990s – has an estimated net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. That’s roughly 15 times as much as the combined maximum reported net worth of former President Joe Biden’s entire outgoing Cabinet. Five Trump Cabinet members reported holding individual assets worth more than $50 million, the highest range on disclosure forms. And that doesn’t include Musk, the world’s richest person with a net worth of about $371 billion, who as a special government employee is not required to publicly report anything about his wealth. While Biden filled his Cabinet mostly with bureaucrats and politicians, Trump’s team also includes former CEOs who ran major energy and financial services companies before joining him in Washington. “We’re seeing industry officials coming into the executive branch in a way that we’ve never seen in past administrations, including the first Trump administration,” said Danielle Caputo, senior ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. While supporters of Trump’s efforts say industry expertise helps officials better understand the fields they regulate, ethics watchdogs fear actions undertaken by highly-connected officials could benefit their former companies and colleagues instead of the American public. Some moves could particularly benefit the super-wealthy. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, for instance, has taken a chainsaw to the Internal Revenue Service, which includes a unit that audits America’s ultrawealthy. Data obtained by CNN and first reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that the Global High Wealth unit was hit by layoffs at a far higher rate through March of this year than the IRS as a whole. Trump has also rescinded a Biden-era executive order creating ethics requirements for political appointees. Members of the past three administrations — including those who worked under Trump during his first term — previously had to commit not to accept gifts from lobbyists. They were also banned from working on issues they lobbied on in the two years before their appointment, and after leaving government, couldn’t lobby on behalf of industries they’d recently regulated. Those rules would have banned or limited the roles of eight Trump nominees, including three officials tapped for Environmental Protection Agency roles who lobbied for fossil fuel groups in recent years, according to an analysis by Campaign Legal Center shared with CNN. Additionally, CLC found Trump has named at least six political appointees to serve as senior ethics officials, a role normally held by nonpartisan career officials. Inspectors general across more than a dozen different agencies were fired during Trump’s first week in office. The IGs act as independent watchdogs, and the president is supposed to provide a 30-day notice to Congress before removing them, which Trump failed to do. Trump defended the move by suggesting some IGs had been “unfair” and firing them was “a very standard thing to do.” On the campaign trail, Trump promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” He kicked off his second term with moves to boost the crypto industry such as establishing a national bitcoin reserve, dissolving a Biden-era task force that investigated crypto criminals, installing a Musk ally as “crypto czar” and revoking a banking rule that discouraged financial institutions from owning crypto. At the same time, Trump and his family have gotten deep into crypto by launching a new firm and the president’s own meme coin, a digital asset that has no underlying value and trades largely on hype. Trump also installed Lutnick, a banker who before his swearing-in was overseeing more than $1.5 billion in crypto-related investments, as his commerce secretary. Lutnick has long pushed to legitimize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Last October, while he was still CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, he told a podcast host he had “hundreds and hundreds of millions” of exposure to bitcoin, presumably through crypto assets held by his firm. Cantor Fitzgerald is now run by his son, which ethicists say leaves Lutnick with an improperly close tie to the firm’s success. “By turning it over to a family member, you may not benefit directly, but you surely have an interest in the well-being of your child,” said Briffault. Cantor Fitzgerald didn’t respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Trump’s sons launched a digital currency company, World Liberty Financial, in 2024, and took an ownership stake in a bitcoin mining venture called American Bitcoin last month. Trump’s own media company announced plans earlier this year to potentially buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At least eight top officials in the executive branch disclosed crypto holdings in their financial disclosures, although some agreed to divest the assets. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, HHS Secretary Kennedy and Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz each reported owning more than $500,000 in crypto assets. An HHS spokesperson told CNN that “Secretary Kennedy continues to adhere to all ethical and legal requirements.” So far, the Trump administration’s crypto moves haven’t led to a boom in valuations for digital assets. While the price of bitcoin, a bellwether for the $3 trillion crypto market, skyrocketed nearly 50% between Trump’s election victory and inauguration, it has fallen about 9% since then, mirroring broader stock market declines. Still, Eric Talley, a Columbia University professor who studies corporate law, said he saw the Trump administration’s efforts to promote crypto, and specifically the strategic bitcoin reserve, as “particularly suspicious.” “The economic stakes — if you were a heavy holder of crypto — would be huge and profoundly positive if you could cause the US government to essentially guarantee a big chunk of the stability of the market of at least some of the crypto issuances,” he said. During his time in the private sector, former fracking executive Chris Wright was a zealous and vocal critic of government regulations meant to curb global warming. His company Liberty Energy filed a lawsuit that challenged a federal rule requiring companies to disclose details about greenhouse-gas emissions. In one video he posted on social media, Wright declared, “There is no climate crisis.” Now, as energy secretary, Wright has authority to reverse some of the policies he railed against as Liberty’s CEO. Wright has ordered the department to “build energy infrastructure and remove barriers to progress,” among other steps, to achieve US “energy dominance.” Under his leadership, the agency has ceased its pursuit of a net-zero carbon future, cut fossil fuel regulations and accelerated numerous natural gas export projects. Inside the department, Wright has alarmed some staffers with his embrace of fracking over other energy projects. Four current Department of Energy employees, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, described a general attitude of hostility toward most renewable energy. One staffer pointed to webpages that once promoted solar energy and have now been taken offline, and other employees described circulating lists of renewable energy programs that could be on the chopping block. Having a former fracking executive run the energy department is “absolutely a conflict of interest,” one staffer said. Some of Wright’s former Liberty colleagues have also followed him into the department, including his current scheduling director, one of his advisers and a Liberty board member who has been nominated to serve as an assistant energy secretary. In the short term, falling oil prices due to economic turmoil under Trump could hurt fracking companies. But leaders at Wright’s former company have applauded the policy shifts. “We have an administration now that is working hard to remove some of the impediments that have been challenges,” Liberty Energy CEO Ron Gusek said at the New York Stock Exchange in March. “Those things give us a path forward to invest in our business.” According to his ethics documents, Wright owned about $54 million worth of Liberty stock as of February, though disclosures show he sold off Liberty shares in recent weeks and moved money into general investment funds. He also disclosed that he would receive a roughly $1 million performance bonus for his work last year from the fracking company in March, after his swearing-in. A Liberty filing last month stated he received his bonus. A Liberty spokesperson said, “To our knowledge, there has been no communication with Secretary Wright or any representative from the Department of Energy regarding Liberty Energy business.” While the fossil fuel industry cheers Wright’s successes, some communities that expected financial help from the Department of Energy have faced roadblocks. Under a program funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, for example, the department planned to disperse $500 million in grants to help schools in disadvantaged regions across the US improve their energy efficiency. But multiple school district administrators told CNN that since Wright took over, the department has largely stopped communicating with them about federal funding from the program. Now, some districts fear they won’t receive all the money they were promised. Mosier Community School, a public charter school in a rural Oregon county that voted for Trump, was awarded a roughly $870,000 grant from the program. That money could help replace the school’s unreliable century-old heater and windows that are currently held closed with tape, said Brent Foster, who leads a committee to upgrade the school’s infrastructure. This year, the DOE has canceled meetings with the school about the grant and has not been processing requests related to the project, according to Foster, who said he doesn’t know whether the funds will ever come through. Winning the grant “felt like a miracle,” Foster said. “The idea that the federal government would sign a contract… then pull the rug out from under us, it’s difficult to understand.” An Energy Department spokesperson said the agency is reviewing all activities to ensure they follow the law and align with the administration’s priorities. “President Trump’s administration is advancing a strategy of energy addition – embracing all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure,” said the spokesperson, who added that Wright has complied with department ethics requirements. The federal government has earmarked tens of billions of dollars to close the digital divide, connecting millions of rural Americans to fast, reliable internet. And for years, Musk’s SpaceX has tried to become eligible for the funds, at times without success. In 2022, the Federal Communications Commission rejected a nearly $900 million grant application by Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet system, saying the company failed to show it could deliver on the promised service. Similarly, the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program was specifically designed to prioritize the gold standard of broadband internet – fiber-optic cables – over other technologies such as satellite service. But that changed rapidly after Trump took office. Lutnick announced last month that the Commerce Department would end “woke mandates” and “favoritism towards certain technologies.” In practice, that means potentially opening up billions in funding for satellite internet companies. Lutnick’s directive could enable Musk’s company to earn up to $20 billion from the amended BEAD program, according the Wall Street Journal. Today, Starlink is uniquely positioned to provide commercial satellite-based internet. However, other companies, including Amazon, may compete for BEAD grants in the future. Musk has long criticized the federal government’s rural internet efforts, claiming that had the FCC not rejected Starlink’s grant application in 2022, “it would probably have saved lives in North Carolina” after Hurricane Helene decimated the area. The BEAD program, Musk said, is an “an outrageous waste of taxpayer money” that is “utterly failing to serve people in need.” SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Experts say satellite-based internet service could play a useful role in connecting low-density remote areas. But many argue a fiber-optic connection is more reliable and weather resistant than what satellite service can offer today. “Fiber can handle an almost unlimited amount of bandwidth. Fiber is scalable in terms of speed. Fiber is what we call ‘future proof,’” said Christopher Ali, a professor of telecommunications at Penn State University. Lutnick’s move to change the program is now prolonging delays in getting shovels in the ground, even as the GOP has blasted the Biden administration over its failure to spend the money more quickly. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune and 12 additional Republican senators, for example, have said the program has “onerous regulations” and moves slowly due to “unnecessary government interference.” The Commerce Department didn’t respond to requests for comment. Some states with approved BEAD proposals are waiting for the green light from the federal government before starting work while others are amending their proposals. A final draft proposal dated March 2025 from West Virginia obtained by CNN details a plan to bring a fiber-optic internet connection to every resident in the state. But after Gov. Patrick Morrisey met with Lutnick later that month, he announced West Virginia would revise the proposal to “evaluate a broader range of technology options, including satellite.” “The West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council has always supported fiber deployment and continues to do so,” said Bill Bissett, who heads up the council. “Every day we delay is another day that West Virginians who are underserved or unserved will not have access to this critical resource,” he added. Because of Lutnick’s change, government officials will “re-run a process they’ve already completed solely to put satellite service in places that were going to get fiber,” said Evan Feinman, who until recently oversaw the rollout of the BEAD program. “That service will be dramatically slower, less reliable in bad weather … and will cost at least $800 more per year (per household) than the fiber connections would have been.” The change in direction of the BEAD program is the “poster child for why people should be concerned about conflicts of interest” in this administration, said Briffault, the Columbia law professor, who spoke about how members of Trump’s inner circle could be putting a thumb on the scale. “You cannot be confident that the decision is being made on the policy merits, as opposed to the influence of a self-interested individual who stands to make a ton of money on it,” he said.

Title: Google Calls More Remote Staff Back to Office—or Else

We forget how good we had it. Google is putting the last nails in the work-from-home coffin as it orders more remote employees to return to offices on a hybrid schedule or risk losing their jobs. The endless cubicle farms, which could have been repurposed for better use like housing or shopping, are not going anywhere just yet. CNBC reports that teams in Google’s Technical Services and People Operationsâor human servicesâdivisions were told this week they must report to their closest office three days a week or take a voluntary exit package. Some in human resources approved for remote work and who live 50 miles or more away from an office can remain in their positions, but cannot take new roles in the company. The news is hardly a shock. Google has been demanding employees return to offices since implementing mass layoffs in early 2023, and just about every major company has swung back jarringly from the early pandemic, when employees were allowed to work from anywhere. Some company leadersâincluding Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorseyâhad once proclaimed that remote work was here to stay forever. The contrast between working in tech from 2010-2020 vs 2020-now is so jarring to think about I sometimes feel like the 2010's couldn't have been real — BuccoCapital Bloke (@buccocapital) April 24, 2025 Despite record profits and earnings, tech companies have said their companies became too bloated during the pandemic, and layoffs would give them more resources to invest in the expensive artificial intelligence build outs. Terminating workers under the guise of remote work could be an excuse to eliminate staff they did not want anyway. Some employees laid off by in recent years Meta, for instance, have reported being added to “do not rehire” lists despite performing above expectations during their tenure. That company laid off an additional 5% earlier this year, but did attribute those cuts specifically to performance. Critics of return-to-office mandates have pointed out the irony of the tech industry in particular eliminating remote work, since the entire idea of the internet was to decentralize communication and enable a flattened, global economy that does not rely on power centers like Silicon Valley. Many people moved when they went remote, stimulating smaller economies. But alas, there is a network effect to being around like-minded individuals, and much of the tech sector is still concentrated in San Francisco. Sergey Brin, one of Google’s reclusive cofounders, told employees in a meeting early this year that 60 hours a week in-office is the sweet spot for staff working on developing cutting-edge AI products and keep up with the competition. Somewhat ironically, luminaries like Brin and Klarnaâs Sebastian Siemiatkowski have said they believe AI will eliminate the need for as many programmers, though others say it will simply increase velocity of new product development. âAs weâve said before, in-person collaboration is an important part of how we innovate and solve complex problems,â Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said in a statement to CNBC. âTo support this, some teams have asked remote employees that live near an office to return to in-person work three days a week.â Employees in tech do not have much of a choice in the matter. Recurring waves of mass layoffs have returned power to leadership after a decade in which tech workers could expect enormous compensation and benefits packagesâas well as demand their employers abide by lofty mission statements and shun more ethically dubious work, like defense contracting. CEOs have griped that remote workers are less productive, but the data to support that belief is mixed. There may be some decrease in productivity, and junior employees can benefit from being in office. But turnover is lower amongst remote workers, and by working from home, employees save time commuting. Proponents argue that the remote work model is in fact more performance based than relying on butts-in-seats as a metric for measuring employee productivity. A slew of surveys have found that Americans prefer employers who offer remote work for the added lifestyle benefits, and many would even take a pay cut of up to 20% in order to work remotely. Some employees in tech have been so resistant that they have gone out kicking and screaming, using techniques like “coffee badging” to show up at work for an hour to swipe their badge and go right back home. Meta and Amazon responded by requiring employees to continuously report their location throughout the day. Demanding employees come back to the office is one big way to claw back power. Leaders at Google and others have reasserted themselves in other ways, like shutting down protests and open discussion over company policies that in previous years were encouraged. Leaders apparently now believe that protest and internal dissent harms productivity and that everyone should be laser-focused on the company’s mission. Plus, it’s no fun when your own employees are complaining about you publicly. The national office vacancy rate remains elevated from 2019 levels, suggesting remote work is here to stay, just not to the same degree as during the early pandemic.

Initially, standard tools suffice, but as the company scales in engineers, maturity, and complexity, industry tools may no longer meet needs, Carlos Arguelles said at QCon San Francisco. Inflection points, such as a crisis, hyper-growth, or reaching a new market, often trigger these investments, providing opportunities for improving productivity and operational excellence. Carlos Arguelles gave a talk about Amazon’s inflection points in engineering productivity. When a company first starts, it doesn’t make sense for it to create its own developer tools, as there are plenty of excellent ones available in the industry, he said. But as a company grows (in number of engineers, in maturity, in customer adoption, in domains), investing in its own developer tools starts making sense: An inflection point is when that investment in engineering productivity that didn’t make sense before now suddenly does. This could be because the industry tools do not scale, or because the internal tools can be optimized to integrate better with the rest of the ecosystem, as Arguelles explained. A little papercut where each developer is wasting a couple of minutes per day in toil can add to hundreds of millions of dollars of lost productivity in a company like Amazon or Google. The more obvious inflection point that made investments in engineering productivity become feasible is the number of engineers. Maybe it didn’t make sense for your company to have its own CI/CD proprietary tooling when there were 3000 engineers, but it does when there are 10,000 engineers, because the savings in developer productivity with a toolchain optimized for the ecosystem have a significant return on investment, Arguelles said. He mentioned that the opposite is true as well. When your company is in hypergrowth it may make sense to have duplicate tools (each organization creating its bespoke tool so that it can independently move fast), but when the company stops growing (which is what happened in 2023 with all the big tech layoffs), it makes sense to consolidate tooling and defragment the world. Arguelles gave some more examples of inflection points, like reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence can provide an inflection point or entering an entirely different and new market. Sometimes the inflection point is a crisis or even a single operational issue that could have been prevented with the right tooling: For example, Amazon invested significantly in a number of load, stress, and chaos testing tools after the Prime Day incident of 2018 (where the Amazon Store was unavailable for hours during the busiest shopping day of the year). We had been talking about doing that for years, but that incident helped us sharpen our focus and build a solid case for funding those investments. Inflections can also happen when an organization experiences hyper-growth: I saw Amazon double in size every year, from 3000 engineers when I started in 2009, to 60k-70k in 2022. What this meant in practice is that we needed to be thinking about skating to where the puck was going to be, not where it currently was. Scaling needs and security needs often meant sooner or later we needed to create our own developer tools, Arguelles said. Over time, they developed tools to scale source code repositories and built their own tools for code reviews and CI/CD (including testing and deployment): Because of that hyperscale, we often found ourselves needing to re-think our architecture much sooner than we had envisioned. But it also provided ample opportunities to innovate and think differently! Inflection points are inevitable and occur naturally in many situations: a company drastically increasing or shrinking in terms of number of engineers, a crisis, reaching a certain level of maturity where you need to raise the bar in terms of engineering or operational excellence, or entering an entirely different and new market, Arguelles said. He concluded that it is important to have your eyes open, recognize when these inflection points are around the corner, proactively shape your engineering productivity tooling for the future, and seize the opportunities.

Photo: Shutterstock/DJANA 575 By Bloomberg News Apr 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –For an increasing number of Chinese exporters, many of whom battled through the trade war in President Donald Trump’s first term and who have invested years to capture the spending power of American shoppers, it may be closing time in the US. With tariffs on Chinese imports at 145%, factories that make items like coffee machines and yoga pants have halted shipments to the US and have idled their assembly lines to a three or four day week. And while Trump has indicated that tariffs won’t stay that high on China forever, some fearful exporters are making permanent plans to withdraw from the US market and turn to other regions like the Middle East for sales instead. Exporters are now trying to “survive” the current crisis, said Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents some 3,000 exporters. Businesses are taking steps to generate cash like selling inventory for higher prices, and cancelling warehouse rental agreements in the US, she said. One such exporter is a Guangzhou-based retailer that sells underwear and yoga pants via Amazon, Temu and Shein, which decided to stop shipping any more products to the US earlier this month, and raised prices of some of its most popular products by as much as 30% to generate more cash. “We had some urgent meetings in late March to discuss our next steps. The conclusion was to stop fighting for the US market,” said sales manager Huang Lun. The plight of Chinese exporters mean US consumers could face rising prices and shortages of crucial goods in the coming months. The grim outlook adds to rising bets among economists that the US will enter a recession if the White House doesn’t back down on its tariff threats. China will also endure substantial economic pain. With their largest market on hold, many factories have cut back production to just three or four days per week, said Wang, citing a recent industry survey conducted by the association. With bank loans and worker salaries to pay, there will be a wave of factory closures and worker layoffs in the coming months, she said. Jenny Huang, a salesperson at a Ningbo-based curtain maker, is trying to diversify beyond the US though 90% of its current client base — business that has come to an abrupt halt — is there. The company will only consider exporting to the US again when tariff situation clears up, she says. Until then, it is exploring opportunities elsewhere such as Southeast Asia the Middle East. “When the tariffs were raised to 54%, people already suffered very slim profits but still decided to stay and buy time to explore new markets with the cash flow generated in the US,” said Wang. “But when it was raised to 125% and then 145%, people decided to quit because you’ll die faster if you insist on staying in the US.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Elon Musk Gets $10 Billion Richer As Tesla Stock Rallies On ‘Mea Culpa’ —Despite Brutal Earnings

The world’s richest person got much richer Wednesday as shares of Elon Musk’s car company Tesla soared following the company’s first-quarter earnings update—which offered little encouragement in its traditional financial results, but gave investors what they long yearned for: Musk recommitting to Tesla after months of paying his near undivided attention to the White House. Elon Musk attends a White House cabinet meeting in February. Musk’s net worth climbed $7.5 billion to $369.2 billion Wednesday, according to our latest calculations, extending his lead over the next wealthiest person, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to $170 billion. The spike came as shares of Tesla shot up 5% to $251 in response to its late Tuesday Q1 report, which was ugly by most metrics, as profits and revenues both came in below consensus forecasts at multiyear lows. Tesla certainly got a boost from a broader rally tied to President Donald Trump’s relenting on his China trade standoff and his threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell – the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 3% – but the rally largely came as Musk confirmed his dedication to Tesla. “Mea culpa Elon” was the tone struck by the Tesla chief on the earnings call, remarked Evercore ISI analysts led by Chris McNally, as Musk said he’ll be “allocating far more” of his time to the company starting next month. That was music to the ears of many investors and analysts who had expressed concerns about the extensive time Musk spent as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – and the associated damage to Tesla’s brand as Musk’s outspoken politics rubbed many potential customers the wrong way. In addition to Musk’s rededication to Tesla, also helping catalyze the stock rally were the confirmation of June launch plans for the driverless “robotaxi” and the beginning of production of lower-cost electric vehicles during the first half of this year, according to Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so,” Musk said during Tuesday’s earnings call. Musk described Tesla as the “least affected car company” by Trump’s tariffs, but the senior advisor to the president again made clear he disagrees with Trump on his signature trade policy. “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity,” said Musk, continuing the tariff “decision is fundamentally up to” Trump. “So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” shrugged Musk. Tesla stock is still down almost 40% year-to-date, far worse than the S&P 500’s 8% decline as Trump’s oft-changing tariffs led to increased concerns of a recession. Musk donated $288 million toward Trump election causes, making him the largest political donor of the 2024 election cycle. Musk’s role as the head of DOGE, in which he oversaw cost-cutting efforts including mass federal government layoffs, brought significant backlash to Tesla, as sales slumped globally as protests and vandalism spread. In addition to his roles at DOGE and Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of aerospace giant SpaceX, generative AI startup xAI and several other companies. Tesla faced a “code red” situation if Musk didn’t recommit to the company, warned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives ahead of earnings. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Rural Trump Voters Won’t Regret Their Vote Until Democrats Fight for Them

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Trump promised to address the opioid epidemic and restore small towns to health and prosperity. The president has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. The damage done just in the Trump administration’s first three months could fill the National Archives—assuming that department still exists. Many of those moves, including the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran gulag, have been cruel and utterly unjust. Yet public support for Trump, though declining, remains stubbornly high among rural and working-class people. Some part of that support comes from his ability to couch everything he does as retaliation against liberal elites and a blow against the “rigged system” those elites helped create—a system that has undermined the values and livelihoods of ordinary working people. What will it take to stop Trump? It’s hard to predict how many of the people who supported Trump will turn against him because of the deportation of Garcia, student activists, and others. Those fights absolutely must continue and, we hope, will awaken more and more Americans to the dismantling of democracy. But there will always be those who are moved more by negative impacts to their daily lives. Job loss, hospital and school closures, a huge spike in the cost of essential goods—these are perennial deal-breakers that outlive the daily news cycle. As we suggested in our February column, reacting negatively to every radical idea Trump tosses out only solidifies the left’s position as defenders of the establishment—the very system tens of millions of Americans blame for their woes. We also believe that protesting the bad stuff only gets us so far, and that a positive vision for bettering the lives of rural and working people must be front and center. That said, when it does come to complaining loudly about the impact of Trump’s chaotic nihilism, we should focus on actions that have hurt large numbers of people, many of whom voted for Trump. We need to empathize with and acknowledge their struggles and help channel it into buyers’ remorse: “Trump has betrayed us” gets to the heart of the matter, whereas “Hands off!” smacks of a desire to restore the status quo. To stop Trump and reverse the assault on our economy and democracy, we need to redeploy some of our outrage to highlight how Trump’s actions are actually making the rigged system worse for the folks who put him in office: farmers, small businesses, coal miners, factory and blue-collar workers, consumers struggling with high prices and debt. Until our protest routinely includes the betrayal of folks like these, we have almost no chance of building the broad resistance coalition needed to reverse the disastrous course we’re on. With that in mind, we offer a few examples of Trump’s betrayals of rural and working-class people that we urge the left to prioritize, while also highlighting policies that will reverse those betrayals. Farmers, a core constituency for Trump, have been among the worst hit by his actions since taking office. For midsize and larger farmers, tariffs have prompted widespread anxiety that they are being squeezed from both ends: They’re facing higher costs on inputs like Canadian potash and steel for agricultural equipment, combined with a potentially dramatic loss of markets for soybeans, pork, and other commodities. On top of that, the dismantling of USAID amounts to nearly $2 billion in lost sales for US farmers. For smaller farmers, the termination of the Farm to School program and the Local Food Purchase Program for food banks have eliminated more than $1 billion in markets for fresh produce, while undermining the effort to provide healthy food to kids and people in need. And for farmers of all sizes, the suspension of contractual payments to farmers who’ve undertaken conservation, soil building, renewable energy, and other improvements to their farms is devastating. At least 30,000 of these farmers, who each expended tens of thousands of dollars based on USDA commitments, now find themselves in debt, unclear whether the promised reimbursements will ever materialize. But farmers aren’t the only rural folks getting screwed. Workers and small-business owners are increasingly worried about their livelihoods. Even before the latest round of tariffs, small-business confidence had declined for all three months of Trump’s presidency, with just one in five small business owners saying they expect sales and business conditions to improve in the near future. That uncertainty translates to less investment and hiring on the part of existing small businesses, and fewer new business start-ups. For workers in bigger companies, the surge in union organizing seen under the Biden administration is running into a wall of anti-worker actions from Trump. These include the firing of pro-worker members of the NLRB such as Jennifer Abruzzo, replaced by Crystal Carey, a lawyer whose firm represents notoriously anti-union Tesla and Amazon. Trump has also eliminated the $17 hourly minimum-wage requirement for federal contractors while working to completely dismantle unions representing federal workers. Ned Resnikoff Books & the Arts / Nathan Taylor Pemberton Kate Wagner StudentNation / Christopher Malley and Nathaniel Moses Veterans, who are more likely to live in rural areas, will be hurt especially hard by the double kneecapping of Medicaid and Veterans Affairs (VA). The New York Times reports that, in addition to layoffs, the VA has been rocked by DOGE’s abrupt return-to-work policy. VA psychiatrists who have, for decades, counseled veterans remotely, now suddenly have to conduct their sessions in open cubicles that lack privacy. Many of them are quitting in protest. Fourteen million (nearly one in five) rural adults rely on Medicaid, a program Republicans aim to cut by $880 billion (roughly 20 percent of the program) over the next decade. Already struggling rural hospitals and clinics rely on Medicaid funds to stay afloat. Over the past 10 years, nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed, leaving their patients stranded a hundred or more miles from the nearest emergency room. Most of the rural hospitals that do remain open have eliminated their maternity wards. Slashing Medicaid spending will trigger further hospital closures and strain already paltry substance abuse, mental health, and Indian health services. And then there are the millions of consumers just struggling to make ends meet. They’ve been hit not only by continued rising prices—the inflation rate has been between 2.4 and 3 percent since Trump took office—but by the elimination of protections from junk fees from banks and credit card companies. Joined by the Republican-controlled Senate, the Trump administration is eliminating the $8 late-fee cap instituted toward the end of Biden’s term, allowing companies to once again charge exorbitant fees to people who don’t pay on time. The lower average incomes of rural and working-class people make high prices and junk banking fees all the more difficult to manage. Donald Trump carried rural America by a 40-point margin. He promised forgotten Americans he would unrig the system, address the opioid epidemic, and restore small towns to health and prosperity. Even more than most of his predecessors, Trump has betrayed those who placed their trust in him. Reversing the tidal wave of destruction he has unleashed requires that we on the left do something we should have done a long time ago: open our doors wide to the farmers, miners, truckers, house cleaners, automakers, and working folks—white, brown, and Black—who picked him over us. We don’t just need them to regain Congress in 2026. We need them to save our country. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.
