Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?

Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Elon Musk's X is the least-trusted Big Tech company, according to a survey — on par with the US government

Americans think Elon Musk's X is as trustworthy as the US government. And that's not a compliment. A May survey published by All About Cookies, a company promoting digital security and online privacy, asked 1,000 US adults how much they trusted Big Tech and media companies compared to their government. EMARKETER, a market research company owned by Business Insider's parent company, shared the survey data on Friday. While companies like Amazon and Google topped the list, Musk's platform came in dead last. The survey's data showed that 70% of respondents trust Amazon, 65% trust Google, and 64% trust Netflix. Only 29% trusted TikTok, which ByteDance, a Chinese company, owns. US officials worry that ByteDance shares data with the Chinese government and have demanded it divest TikTok to an American-owned company or face a nationwide ban. Even fewer — only 28% of respondents — however, trusted X, the same percentage that trusted the US government. The survey showed that 43% of respondents distrusted the US government, while 44% distrusted X. Although the survey didn't clarify why respondents ranked X last on the list, the platform has been a magnet for controversy since Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, rebranded it, and overhauled how it moderates content. Musk conducted mass layoffs after taking control of Twitter, particularly among its trust and safety team, whose numbers dwindled from about 230 employees to about 20. More trust and safety staffers were laid off the following year. Yoel Roth, once the head of the trust and safety team, resigned from the company soon after Musk's arrival. Concerns about misinformation on the social media app grew quickly after Musk's purchase, so he launched Community Notes in 2022. A 2023 Bloomberg report said it analyzed almost 400 X posts that contained false information about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, however, and found that it typically took more than seven hours for a Community Note to appear, and some took 70 hours. Musk himself has faced backlash for his own questionable posts, including in 2023 when business leaders criticized him for amplifying an antisemitic post on X. He backtracked in January during a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association, saying he was "naive" about antisemitism and is "Jewish by association." Musk is now dealing with the fallout from another X post this month after former President Donald Trump survived a second apparent assassination attempt. Musk asked in the post why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven't also faced similar threats. Musk's post immediately drew backlash for promoting political violence, prompting him to delete it and defend himself, calling it a "joke." The US Secret Service told Bloomberg News it is "aware" of Musk's post and is investigating the matter. Musk's X has also run afoul of multiple foreign governments, most recently in Brazil, where X lawyers on Friday finally capitulated to demands for stricter content moderation months after the country's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban of the platform. Representatives for X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Cory Doctorow at DEFCON: Disenshittify or Die

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Cory Doctorow, a renowned science fiction author and journalist, gave an enthralling speech at the recently concluded DEF CON. titled ‘DISENSHITTIFY OR DIE’. The word enshittification may seem alien to most people and it probably can’t be contained in a simpler definition. It is an entire process of exploiting end-users through a series of steps. Consider this: when the Internet first came into existence, the platforms were very simple. But is it the same now? A big NO, take Microsoft for example. Now, they allow you to use apps on the cloud, and track the features that are most important to you. They then take those features out of the basic package and sell them to you separately. This is called enshittification. The first step of this enshittification process starts with businesses appearing to be good to their end users. For example, Facebook shows you what you want to see, Uber charges less for cabs, and Amazon subsidizes goods and returns, and puts the best match of products at the top of the search results. However, there’s a hidden, more sinister part of stage one – locking in users. Now, there are several ways a platform can lock users in. Apple parts also use parts pairing, which is DRM handshakes between subcomponents and the main device, so that you cannot use third-party parts to fix a broken device. Plus, every part of the device has a microscopic Apple logo, so third-party parts are subject to trademark violation. Once businesses have locked users in, they start making things worse for users and better for themselves. For instance, platforms poison their search results with ads. Let’s take Amazon for example, who sells its search results, making $38 billion every year. And this costs a ton of money for businesses. Around 45% of the price of these products goes to Amazon. As a result, businesses have to increase the prices to make up for the lost margin. But that’s not the end. Amazon has a policy called the ‘Most Favoured Nation Status’ which means that the cheapest price they offer must be matched on Amazon. So what’s the solution? Businesses raise their prices everywhere – Target, Walmart, and your local shops. Similarly, Facebook poisons your feed too. It shows you less of the content from the people you follow and more of sponsored content and boosted posts. There’s an old adage that says “If you’re not paying for the product, then you’re the product”. However, Cory does not agree with this. Apple once offered a one-click option to opt out of app-based surveillance and 96% opted out. But now. Apple has turned on iOS spying, which collects users’ data for ad targeting with no option to opt out. So, even after paying $1,000 for the phone, you’re still the product. The same goes for Facebook’s ad business. This is the phase where businesses suck out all the utility from their products leaving users trapped. They do so through twiddling. With this, businesses alter the service backend to change its operations, costs, prices, search ranking, and other foundation aspects of the system. Digital platforms have made twiddling very easy. The same goes for YouTube videos. After spending thousands of dollars on a video, it is the algorithm that decides who watches them. In many cases, these videos don’t even reach the subscribers. However, there are some upsides to twiddling as well. Forbes’ Emily Baker White revealed that TikTok has a feature called the heating tool. When applied to a user’s account, this tool boosts videos from that particular creator, which reaches millions of users, irrespective of the recommendation algorithm. But why does TikTok do this? Let’s say TikTok wants more sports content on its platform. They randomly pick an account and heat it up so that the content gets a lot of traction. When other creators see this, they think that sports content is in trend and they start making similar content. And quite naturally, they do not get the traction similar to the first creator and they end up thinking that they’re missing something and doing TikTok wrong. The same thing goes for Uber drivers making $100,000 a year, sub-stackers rolling in dough, or Joe Rogan’s Spotify payout. The reason is pretty simple – the less value a business gives to suppliers, customers, and workers, the more value is left to be divided between the shareholders and executives. But, the real question is why NOW? Earlier there were consequences to enshittification. For example, companies like MySpace and Yahoo Search are down in the dumps, since they enshittified their products way too early. But now, there are no consequences of enshittification. Let’s explain the lack of consequences. There are four forces that discipline tech companies: Your customers should not find it easy to leave you and switch to a rival product. For example, the network effect of Facebook has prevented its users from leaving. But the main question is whether there’s an alternative. Similarly, Apple, Microsoft, and Google aren’t making things companies but buying them, which has led to a monopolistic market economy. This, in turn, has been made possible due to the government’s unexplained tolerance towards anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions, predatory pricing, and market-distorting exclusivity deals, which are prohibited by antitrust laws. This has made companies too big to fail, which in turn, has made them too big to care. And once companies realize that you’ve nowhere to go and no alternative in sight, they start treating you badly. When the government stopped caring about antitrust laws, they killed all hopes of regulation. Regulation is only meaningful when the regulator is more powerful than the companies it regulates. When the companies become bigger than the government, it becomes almost impossible to regulate them, irrespective of their crimes. And this hefty risk paid off for IBM when Ronald Reagan became the President. Regan believed in a monopoly-driven economy and dropped the case on IBM. Let’s take the example of an industry where there are 100 companies, each fighting for a share of the market. These businesses are too busy thinking about snatching the food off others’ plates and poaching employees and customers. Now imagine these 100 companies merging into five giant corporations, which basically become a ‘cartel’. Now, getting a consensus becomes easier and so does capturing the regulators. This has given them the power to escape privacy or labor rights, just because they do it with an app. For example, spying on your phone activities doesn’t seem to be a privacy violation to businesses just because they do so with an app. The same goes for algorithmic wage violations. So once the competition was killed and cartels overtook regulators, there was still something that could be done – disenshittification. In the tech field, every enshittificatory alteration can be disenshittified. So, every time HP sells you expensive ink, it is inviting a third-party seller to sell a refill kit. Or when Tesla installs codes that do not let you charge your whole battery, it is inviting a competitor to sell you a jailbreaking kit. Once the customer finds ways to disenshittify the enshittified product, that customer is lost forever. This is exactly how interoperability works and is a major check on enshittification. Tech workers have always been in short supply, which gives them an upper hand. And to make these workers work crazy hours, businesses came up with a trick – vocational awe. Businesses appealed to their love for technology and managed to convince them that they were the heroes of the digital transformation. This whole vocation awe worked for a while – employees did put in some hard hours. But, it also backfired for businesses. Since the supply was still short, there was always another employer ready to pay them just as much. But eventually, supply caught up with the demand. Last year, 260,000 tech workers were fired and the businesses gained the upper hand. Businesses and bosses have always been like this. They want to charge hefty prices, while delivering the least value and share as little as possible with workers, users, suppliers, and customers. However, earlier when they tried to enshittify their business, constraints like competition, regulation, interop, and workers stopped them. But now, when all these forces have melted away, the enshittification lever is free to move. During the end of this speech, Cory called for the formation of a new good internet. But for that, the four constraints should be reinstated. The first constraint is competition. After almost 40 years of lull, antitrust is finally coming back. For example, Wiz refused to be merged with Google, which was supposed to be the largest merger in history.. New merger guidelines are being rolled out by the FTC and the DoJ. Countries like the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea are taking more antitrust action in the last 4 years than they did during the past 40 years. The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires a dominant platform to open up APIs so that third-party businesses can offer interoperable services. But that’s not the case with the DMA, it is called an ‘Act’, which means it is enforced in the EU’s federal courts and not Ireland. Even US lawmakers are working towards creating new privacy laws. There has been a movement called the Right to Repair led by the Repair Coalition. In fact, in Oregon, a state R2R bill has been passed that bans parts pairing, where DRMs prevented using new parts unless it was authorized by a technician code. Tech workers were for long made to believe that they were ‘entrepreneurs in making’. But the reality was that workers’ power was because of scarcity and when that ended, layoffs started, and workers lost their edge. The solution is simple – union. Cory referred to the Tech Workers Coalition and Tech Solidarity organization and called for tech workers to get organized. In the end, Cory stressed the fact that it is possible to create a good new internet, with the ‘technological self-determination of the old internet’. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Amazon's return-to-office order bucks job flexibility trend
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366611269/Amazons-return-to-office-order-bucks-job-flexibility-trend

Getty Images/iStockphoto Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent return-to-office order might be more about staff reductions than improving watercooler brainstorming. His letter to employees talks about flattening the organization and having fewer managers. But that language raises suspicion among recruiting experts that the company wants to reduce headcount through attrition. If Amazon wants to reduce headcount, "this is an easy way to do it," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job marketplace ZipRecruiter, of the return-to-office mandate. It might cause natural attrition from workers unhappy with the order and help the company avoid mass layoffs, she said. "At the same time, you can always retain your superstar performers by negotiating exceptions for them on a one-on-one basis," Pollak said. But she also said it's possible Amazon had trouble running an effective remote work program. Despite Amazon's return-to-work order, flexible work arrangements have remained constant, according to ZipRecruiter's quarterly analysis of labor market changes. The current share of remote and hybrid job postings in the tech industry is above 20%, similar to 2021 data, Pollak said. "We don't see much pullback," she said. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, a telecommuting research and consulting firm, said she sees return-to-office mandates as being connected to staff reduction goals. "There's no doubt that AI will replace many of the types of jobs people do at places like Amazon," Lister said. "Even prior to the pandemic, hybrid work reversals were often a thinly disguised attempt to get people to quit, rather than having to lay them off." For employers, remote and hybrid work options will produce three times as many job applications compared with non-remote positions, Pollak said. When companies offer these options, attrition falls around 35%, she said. "Workers who work remotely are prepared to take an 8% pay cut because they value it so much," she said. There is little in job ad data that suggests Amazon's return-to-office order is a future of work trend. While there has been some pullback on fully remote jobs, at least in job listings, hybrid job ads are on the rise. Employer preference is shifting to hybrid work, according to data from WilsonHCG, a recruitment processing outsourcing provider. It has found that remote job postings account for 3.4% of all job postings in the U.S., or about 220,000 jobs, a decline ranging from 5% to 6% a year ago. But there has been a shift to hybrid ads, which is nearing 2% of all job postings, nearly double that from 18 to 24 months ago, according to the firm. What employers want is the ability to have workers on-site when needed, said Charles Faigle, executive vice president of talent solutions in the Americas at WilsonHCG. "It's all about flexibility within their workforce," he said. The workforce is also shifting in other ways. TalentNeuron, a labor market intelligence firm, said it is seeing a rise in the 40-hour, four-day workweek, according to an analysis of job postings. The job areas with the highest rise for this trend are medical and health, engineering, quality assurance, IT, administrative and clerical, and operations and logistics. "Many employees cite the four-day workweek as a primary incentive -- even over salary -- for the considerations around a role," said Erica Lee, a senior consultant at TalentNeuron. The firm identified, for instance, 103,000 job postings in the medical and health care field that explicitly mentioned a four-day workweek. These job ads represented less than 5% of the total current job ads, but the overall trend of the four-day workweek has increased more than 50% over the last several years. Dan Schwabel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm, said he sees a trend to tech employees losing remote work options, although it varies by companies. "Some tech companies continue to offer flexible or fully remote options to attract and retain talent," Schawbel said. "Smaller startups and certain tech roles may still provide more flexibility."

Title: Tech job seekers face hard times as industry resets

The big picture: For decades, having a job in tech meant stability, regular raises, and lucrative perks. However, that has changed, perhaps permanently. The tech labor market is currently in upheaval, with firms letting go of employees by the thousands and tightening hiring requirements when they are looking to fill positions. The only safe space appears to be in AI. Since the start of the year, more than 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Companies across the industry spectrum are cutting tech positions, including some of the largest names in the game. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have all downsized this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP, Intel, PayPal, and Cisco. Furthermore, employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, according to Pequity, a compensation-planning startup. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. This is not new information for those in the industry seeking employment. Last year, over 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs, making 2023 the second-largest year of layoffs on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The market isn't what it once was," Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, told CNBC. "To secure a new position, many salespeople and recruiters are leaving tech entirely. Even engineers are compromising – accepting roles with less stability, a tougher work environment, or lower pay and benefits." The trend doesn't appear to be part of the typical cyclical fluctuations that characterize tech employment, either. The Wall Street Journal recently referred to it as a fundamental reset in an industry that is readjusting its labor needs. Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, companies are now zeroing in on revenue-generating products and services in their hiring strategies. This shift means that sectors that weren't very profitable, such as virtual reality and devices, are facing significant cuts. Tech firms are also scaling back on entry-level hires and eliminating recruiting teams. Companies that are hiring are now looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group at staffing firm Robert Half, told The Wall Street Journal, "They want to see people who are more versatile." AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, perhaps not surprisingly. Individuals who have worked on large language models can easily find jobs with salaries reaching $1 million a year. AI engineers are being offered two to four times the salary of a regular engineer, according to Pequity CEO Kaitlyn Knopp. "That's an extreme investment of an unknown technology," she said. "They cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that." Tech workers may understandably feel a sense of whiplash from these changes. During the pandemic, firms went on a hiring spree as much of everyday life moved online. Employees were offered generous salaries and significant flexibility as companies competed for talent. Then the economy cooled amid higher interest rates and inflation, leading to large-scale layoffs as companies jettisoned tens of thousands of jobs. However, the current hiring trends are not as closely correlated to the economy as one might think. Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research, told The Wall Street Journal that the past few years represent the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. "You're not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as in earlier time periods," she said. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Amazon's prestige push, China's slowdown and the rise of TikTok are all factors at play. Senior Editor, Beauty As the beauty landscape shape shifts around the world — Amazon ascendant, China decelerating, TikTok dominating and new consumers emerging — the beauty jobs market is evolving accordingly. Companies both established and emerging are reconfiguring their workforces to better meet the demands of these fast-changing times, whether reshaping certain departments, opting for more agility with a fractional model or restructuring. “The bottom line is simplify to amplify,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen. “Part of that is managing for speed and agility.” Related Articles Beauty The 85 Best Beauty Products on Amazon, Tested and Reviewed by Editors Beauty Features Clean Makeup Line Saie Doubles Down on Sustainability Focus With Climate Initiative For many larger players, this changing landscape involves some component of restructuring, with layoffs in certain areas of the business even as others are enhanced. “The intention is to maximize profitability, given the China slowdown, and also even just a touch of overall slowdown in this market as well,” said Cassie Cowman, a cofounder of View From 32, a beauty consultancy that works with both founders and investors. “Companies are figuring out how to structure these teams to maximize that,” she added. “I have some clients that are still seeing decent traffic, for example, but the conversion is very low or maybe the dot-com channel is suffering. So, how are they investing more in the brick-and-mortar business to maximize that channel while it’s seeing strong momentum?” Unilever has unveiled a “comprehensive productivity program,” involving 7,500 office-based layoffs globally to achieve total cost savings of around 800 million euros over the next three years. British media outlets have reported that, as part of the layoff plan, it is set to cut a third of all office roles in Europe by the end of 2025, or around 3,200 roles. In February, The Estée Lauder Cos. revealed a restructuring plan, including layoffs, as it continues to tread water amid struggles in Asia and at home. It’s part of the wider Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, designed to make the company more agile. The owner of Clinique, Mac, Tom Ford and others will reduce its 62,000-strong global workforce by between 3 and 5 percent as part of the plan, the equivalent of as many as 3,100 jobs. This will be carried out over the next two-and-a-half years. That same month, Shiseido introduced a new business plan within which it is offering an early retirement plan to approximately 1,500 employees in Japan to help bolster group growth and profitability. The move is part of an overarching vision. “To achieve sustainable growth, Shiseido Japan will concentrate its activities on brands, products and touchpoints with high growth potential and profitability, strengthening brand and touchpoint strategy,” the company said. Dyson is also cutting around 1,000 jobs in the U.K., roughly one-third of its U.K. workforce, due to what the company has described as “fierce” global competition. At L’Oréal U.S., WWD understands that there has been some restructuring in the consumer products division, resulting in around 40 job losses. These are omni shopper roles, the link between the marketing and sales teams. Sales leads for brands are also being moved to retail leads. In a WARN notice filed in New York last month, No7 Beauty company said that 64 workers at its Manhattan office would be affected by an office closure. “To enhance our ability to invest in the growth of No7 Beauty Company in the U.S., we are restructuring our organization to work more closely within our own retail partners,” said a spokesman. “Moving forward, we will no longer occupy a small number of desks in a shared office space in New York, and most of our team members are being relocated.” Its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance has made several rounds of layoffs. Most recently, LVMH-owed Sephora announced plans to cut its workforce in China by 3 percent, the equivalent to around 120 roles, “in response to the challenging market environment” there. As for what roles companies are hiring, Lisa Mare Ringus, executive vice president of global client strategy and growth at 24 Seven Inc, noted that there has been interest in specific sales roles such as supporting Amazon, social and content, finance and marketing. “We’ve seen more hiring in finance this year than ever before within beauty,” Ringus said. Others have seen a spike in searches for brand chief merchandising officers, as well as sales chiefs and chief commercial officers, also sometimes called chief revenue officers. And of course, those with knowledge of AI and TikTok are increasingly in demand. “It’s also about the new skill set,” said Chen. “When you hire someone they’re going to be much better at AI and use TikTok regularly. You need new people who can engage new customers.” In addition to the strategics, the MLM market has also been changing, resulting in job losses. Rodan + Fields has unveiled a new business model, eliminating about 100 roles. Starting Sept. 1, the company moved away from a multilevel direct-selling model to a new affiliate program, which will be supported by a broader array of marketing and advertising across traditional channels and social media. Struggling Beautycounter has also cut jobs, but as of now, it is not known how many staffers were impacted. Its two freestanding stores in New York and Denver will close as it evaluates its retail strategy. But while some companies are restructuring, some smaller brands are rethinking the way they approach C-suite hiring. Take skin care brand Eighth Day, which is backed by L Catterton. CEO Savannah Sachs has been implementing some fractional C-suite roles for myriad reasons. “There’s been an interesting evolution around the idea of freelance or part-time talent, especially at the executive level. The shift is more than just a rebrand from consulting to fractional. It’s indicative of how that type of part-time leadership role has evolved to be more impactful,” she said. “Rather than consulting when it’s implied that you’re working on the business, but not in the business, a fractional leadership role is one where they’re helping set strategy and also helping execute in a much more integrated way with the existing team, and so it’s more impactful. It feels more dedicated,” she continued. “Yet at the same time, the earlier stage brand or start-up business can sort of punch above their weight in terms of the level of senior talent they can bring in and afford, and it also allows the executive to see across maybe a few different businesses.” Cowman is seeing this, too. “I’m advising some of my brand clients as well, to do that. It’s always really beneficial when these younger brands can bring in top level talent early on.” From the executive side, Ringus said that there are more unemployed beauty executives currently than in recent years amid a backdrop of fewer available positions and increased competition for those roles. “It’s really hard if you’re trying to find a job and you’re over $400,000/$500,000,” she said. “It’s a combination of the availability of the talent, and then their willingness to look at other opportunities, and then the demand for some of these smaller to midsized brands, with bringing in expertise that they need and the bench of talent that they need, but they’re often not ready to make that hiring commitment at those types of salary levels.” Sign up for beauty news straight to your inbox every day Top News Stories Alerts Straight to your Inbox.

Title: Amazon’s RTO mandate likely to boomerang, other companies ‘should not follow suit’

Beginning with the new year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his employees back in the office five days a week, returning to an office routine that was common before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the workplace. The backlash from employees was nearly instantaneous, as they berated Jassy — and the return-to-work policy — and vowed to quit. Others demanded raises in exchange for in-office work requirements. Industry analysts were not surprised by the reaction, and said back-to-office mandates more often than not have the exact opposite effect as intended. According to the employee memo released this week, Jassy believes being back in the office will help boost employee training, bolster collaboration, and strengthen culture. “If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,” Jassy wrote. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we’re going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025.” In fact, a study performed in May indicated mandatory return-to-office (RTO) policies could lead to higher quit rates compared with companies that allow remote or hybrid work. The study by the University of Michigan and University of Chicago found that three large US tech companies — Microsoft, Apple and SpaceX — saw substantially increased attrition, particularly among more senior personnel, when they implemented strict return-to-work policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing employees to quit, however, might be exactly what Amazon wants, according to J. P. Gownder, a vice president analyst with Forrester Research. “There is a chance that Amazon is hoping to induce a level of voluntary attrition with this move in lieu of layoffs. Unfortunately, the best talent often has choices, and most don’t want to work in an office five days a week,” Gownder said. In his memo, Jassy also outlined a plan to reduce managers, saying that “will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership,” he wrote. Amazon’s mandate puts the company in the minority, according to recent research. Among employees with jobs that can be done remotely, 43% work hybrid, 22% work fully remote, and 35% work in the office full time. “Amazon’s decision may just compromise its promise to be ‘Earth’s best employer,’” said Gownder. “The macro data shows that pre-pandemic nostalgia is not a post-pandemic reality. Other companies should not follow suit.” Abandoning hybrid work policies will negatively affect employee experience — particularly recruiting, retention, and diversity — impacting productivity and, potentially, the bottom line, according to Gownder. A Gartner Research study released this month showed 47% of HR leaders are concerned about employee resentment toward their organization. They see change fatigue (70%), return to office mandates (62%), and lack of career growth opportunities (58%) as the biggest drivers of employee unhappiness. Two other Gartner studies this year showed high-performing employees, women and millennials would be the greatest flight risks when strict RTO policies are implemented. (One in three executives handed a RTO mandate would quit, one of those studies showed.) “Mandated on-site requirements can carry very steep costs for talent attraction and retention. This is especially true for high-performers, women and millennials — three employee segments who greatly value flexibility,” said Caitlin Duffy, a director in the Gartner HR practice. “Often, these costs far outweigh the moderate benefits to employee engagement and effort.” Instead of office mandates, flexible hybrid work policies are the gold standard, research has shown. According to a Stanford University study, only 17.6% of employees who can work from home say they want to work in an office five days a week. A June study by McKinsey & Co. showed organizations where employees work in multiple locations (at home, in the office, or at client sites) are more likely to see 10% or greater revenue growth than companies where employees work from a single location. Another McKinsey study revealed that employees consistently point to greater productivity and reduced burnout as primary benefits of flexible work policies. Flexibility is especially important to women, who report having more focused time to work when working remotely, the study showed. William Hatcher, a professor of public administration and chair of social sciences at Augusta University in Georgia, said research is clear that “individuals are more productive at their jobs when they have more control over their schedules.” “Workplaces that empower employees with flexible scheduling policies and teleworking options are more productive, and these organizations are also less likely to have employees suffering from burnout,” Hatcher said. “However, many organizations still follow a dated view of management based on the idea that they must see employees to supervise their work. This view is focused on monitoring employees and not motivating them. Amazon is focusing more on monitoring by ending remote work. Successful workplace policies for creative professionals focus on motivation.” Across industries, employees are also doing the bare minimum to meet in-office mandates. For example, some are simply showing up long enough to get credit for being there before returning home to work — a practice known as “coffee badging. To determine what stops people from coming into the office, workplace management software maker Robin Powered surveyed nearly 600 full-time employees at companies that had flexible work policies. The survey revealed that while RTO mandates are everywhere, they aren’t sticking. Forty-five percent of those surveyed said their company’s mandates required them to be in the office at least four days a week, yet only 24% adhered to the policy. In fact, 46% of respondents said that the reason they don’t come into the office is because they believe they are more productive with their at-home work setup. They frequently cited feeling more productive at home (71%) and not having the right resources at their desk (76%). Amazon’s planned move to five days a week flies in the face of a positive employee experience, according to Gownder. “Consistently, studies show that hybrid [work] drives higher levels of employee productivity,” Gownder said. “Offices have their own distractions, plus onerous commutes. Employees do best at individual level work when they can customize their environments and schedules. Employee experience, Gownder pointed out, is a central driver of productivity, employee retention, and business results. “And when employees feel valued, have purpose, possess a degree of autonomy, and feel trusted, they perform better,” he said. “Offices, by comparison, are great for collaborative exercises that involve brainstorming, team bonding, and certain types of decision-making,” he said. “However, these collaborations can usually be accomplished in a couple of days per week.” Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Title: How CTOs Can Boost Company Health During Economic Downturns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/09/19/how-ctos-can-boost-company-health-during-economic-downturns/

In recent years, there’s been a widespread drive to encourage companies to think of their technology teams and tools not as cost centers, but as revenue drivers. And with technology playing such a large role in today’s businesses, it’s time for leadership teams to think of CTOs as more than just experts in “keeping the lights on.” Companies are accustomed to trusting their CTOs to oversee the creation and acquisition of new technologies when business is humming. But on the flip side, CTOs can also be key players in finding ways to cut costs and/or boost revenues during economic downturns. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council discuss practical, meaningful ways CTOs can positively impact organizational health during difficult times (and why they’re perfectly positioned to do so). CTOs can guide an organization in effectively using its resources, striking a balance between innovation and improvement. In the tech industry, there is always a tug-of-war between investing in new product features to attract new customer segments and improving existing offerings to increase upselling. CTOs can effectively align development goals to optimize returns. - Amrit Jassal, Egnyte Economic cycles continually fluctuate. Some useful questions for a CTO to answer are: How do we rigorously prioritize the existing demand funnel to optimize outcomes? Where can we double down on reusable services and architecture to maximize investments and velocity? What accelerators can we add so that when the cycle rebounds, we can outpace our competitors? This exercise helps a CTO balance “defense” with “offense.” - Micheline Casey, Siemens Energy Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? During an economic downturn, a CTO can positively impact the organization by addressing technical debt and strengthening infrastructure. This prepares the company for future growth and sudden demand increases when the market rebounds, ensuring resilience and agility in changing conditions. - Dzmitry Lubneuski, a1qa During an economic downturn, it’s typical to try to reduce costs by improving operational efficiency. For a CTO in the current market, it’s critical to see how your company can leverage artificial intelligence to do more with less. A couple of practical examples: Improve engineering productivity through introducing a coding assistant like Copilot, and enhance knowledge discovery by leveraging a finely tuned large language model to analyze organizational data. - Bhavdeep Sethi, Frec Markets, Inc. One practical and meaningful way for a CTO to help is to view an economic downturn as an opportunity for innovation. “Do more with less” is the mindset a CTO should drive. A CTO must work with the business to identify and solve challenges through innovation and collaboration. A design-thinking workshop or hackathons can help teams imagine new ways of operating in a new normal. Thus, the CTO becomes an agile change agent. - Alvaro Rozo, Arcus Power Corp. Perform an IT audit that looks for shadow IT, outdated or underutilized software, and gaps in cybersecurity risk mitigation—both for your organization and any key suppliers or vendors that have access to company or customer data. Audits can also trigger new policy and procedure development, potentially saving an organization from financial and regulatory headaches down the road. - Ogie Sheehy, ViClarity During an economic downturn, budgets are constrained and there’s a limited infusion of talent from external sources. A CTO’s blueprint for organizational success must focus on driving the efficiency and effectiveness of the core business processes, operating models and digital workflow capabilities that create competitive differentiation in the marketplace. Look toward leveraging digital transformation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the cloud. - Hemant Ahire, Amazon Web Services A meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is to help the business prioritize technology projects that have the best near-term return on investment. What can be done relatively quickly and for the least amount of money while still moving the needle on both cost and revenue? - Laura Merling CTOs must be honest with the team about the situation, looking for outside-the-box solutions, offering assurance and trying to avoid layoffs. People are the most important aspect of any organization and should always be treated as such. Find ways to cut costs beyond the obvious—automation, enabling new technologies and doing more with what is available are some aspects to consider. - Sameer Zaveri, Datamotive.io One practical and meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is by prioritizing technology investments that drive operational efficiency and cost savings. This can include automating routine tasks, optimizing existing infrastructure and implementing data-driven decision-making tools. - Praveen Andapalli, Vitel Global Communications, LLC As a CTO, you know what works and what doesn’t. Focusing on your company’s competitive advantage allows you to leverage your knowledge and experience to achieve short-term monetary effects. Examine current technologies, market gaps and opportunities. Quickly align with sales, and redirect your efforts toward improving customer-centric technology to increase revenue. - Arturo Garcia, DNAMIC Regardless of economic conditions, one key responsibility of a CTO is optimization, as it directly contributes to the business’ bottom line. Health extends beyond finances to overall company morale. A practical approach is to optimize infrastructure and R&D while maintaining a strong learning culture to keep motivation high, ensuring the team remains engaged and innovative even during a downturn. - Vikrant Labde, Cuelogic Technologies During an economic downturn, a CTO can drive cost efficiency, agility and new revenue by accelerating digital initiatives like cloud computing and automation. This reduces costs, boosts agility and enhances productivity. Investing in digital tools now strengthens competitiveness and positions the organization for growth when the economy recovers. - Volodymyr Dudas, CodeLions A CTO should have a laser focus on the enterprise strategy and ensure all technology projects and initiatives are aligned to it. If a project is not increasing revenue (through cross-sells and upsells), maintaining revenue (through retention), or reducing costs (by making processes, systems and spend more efficient), it should not be prioritized. - Gladwin Mendez, The Global Centre for Risk and Innovation Every downturn is an opportunity to invest in keeping your house in order to prepare for future growth. Today’s challenges are dynamic and unique. So it’s important for a CTO to invest in building a learning culture and growth mindset to prepare the organization to deal with any challenges. Focus on knowledge-sharing, paying off product debt and team-building. - Simana Paul, SumUp A meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is by prioritizing and accelerating digital transformation initiatives, overhauling legacy tech, reducing technical debt and upgrading to maintain an innovation cycle that enhances operational efficiency. - Rignesh Soni, Metropolis During an economic downturn, a CTO can positively impact the organization by focusing on technologies that enhance customer retention. Addressing technical debt, prioritizing features that drive adoption and increase stickiness, and exploring cost-effective development frameworks can optimize resources. This approach ensures a steady revenue stream and builds long-term customer relationships. - Ketan Anand, Suuchi Assuming lower sales activity and, hence, fewer new “promised by sales,” “out of the box” features, an economic downturn could offer a CTO and the engineering team some leeway to focus on reducing technical debt and shoring up implementations in terms of nonfunctional requirements. It’s also a good time to work on minimizing bugs and improving the experience for existing customers, since retention and renewals become key. - Sreenivasan Iyer, Antares Vision Group (RfXcel) A CTO can adopt cloud-based technologies to navigate economic downturns. Cloud migration reduces costs if you leverage a pay-as-you-go model, provides scalable resources and ensures business continuity with redundancy. It supports remote work, boosts agility and innovation and lets businesses focus on core activities by outsourcing IT management, enhancing resilience and efficiency in tough times. - Meenakshi Panda, Capital One As a CTO, it’s crucial for me to manage R&D spend by assessing what drives the best ROI. I’ve analyzed each Scrum team’s contributions, prioritizing projects based on clear ROI. This detailed review impacts both margins and future investments, especially considering R&D’s significant impact on the cost of goods sold. It’s challenging, but it’s essential for business success. - Abishek Viswanathan, Apollo.io
