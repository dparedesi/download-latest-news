With concerns about declining sales and discoverability, UploadVR spoke with nearly two dozen VR studios to discuss the current state of shipping VR games on Quest. It's become increasingly apparent since last year that things are not what they once were, despite Meta's lead in VR and AR seeming unassailable. Meta's Reality Labs division is reporting record revenues, and Quest 3S seems to be selling well. Yet for many developers making VR games, the mood has soured. Some developers are buoyed by revenue through subscription programs like the Quest+ gaming catalog, with every new Quest 3S headset including three months of Quest+. However, many others are now struggling to find sales and to support their teams long-term. UploadVR spoke to developers with concerns about declining sales to learn about the current state of VR game development on Meta's store. Quest 3S seemingly had a successful launch late last year, with pack-in title Batman: Arkham Shadow reaching over one million players. Reality Labs as a whole earned its highest ever quarterly revenue last quarter. But before his departure, Meta's original technical guide through VR John Carmack warned that “setting out to build the metaverse is not the best way to wind up with the Metaverse.” Carmack noted: A memo was recently leaked from Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth noting “Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance.” 2025, it is said then, will determine whether Meta's hardware and metaverse division is “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure”. The wider video games industry continues seeing layoffs despite the industry's market value reportedly reaching around $184.3 billion. Factors cited by some include overinvestment following the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing development costs. Hearing about newly affected studios ending projects or reducing team sizes feels like a weekly occurrence and, for some, Quest is no longer delivering some studios the same returns they've once seen. The pace of complaints from developers seemed to speed up after the Meta Horizon App's redesign back in July, with many citing the transition in their interviews as a sore spot. For some, the store is still profitable, with Eye of the Temple only recouping its development costs after being ported to Meta's headset, even as Gorilla Tag cleared more than $100 million. But for developers seeing declining sales, what exactly is going wrong? Many point to issues concerning discoverability, curation, Meta's increased focus on Horizon Worlds and the decision to merge App Lab with the main store as a tipping point for revenue decline. Most studios requested anonymity in their talks with UploadVR to protect their relationships with Meta, though Andrew Eiche at Owlchemy Labs, Kevin Walker at Middle Man Games, and Alex Nasanov at iTales VR agreed to go on the record. As part of our discussion, Eiche made clear his comments are solely on his and Owlchemy's behalf and do not represent Google, which owns the veteran studio. Most developers feel Horizon Worlds is getting increased attention at the expense of store apps, mentioning it when asked how they view Meta's general direction. Several suggested this approach indicates Meta is pushing a mobile approach aimed at younger audiences, trying to entice young players who have no wallets by prioritizing free-to-play content. They perceive Meta as promoting Horizon Worlds as the default experience for VR users rather than paid apps on the storefront. “This is not the direction I would have chosen,” Andrew Eiche said over a video call with UploadVR. “I think they made a video game console and they want a general computing device.” Notably, Dimensional Double Shift from Owlchemy released as a free multiplayer app on Meta's storefront after a string of paid releases. Technically, this content type isn't supported by Horizon Worlds, which still requires physical input of some kind. Multiple developers sent us pages of screenshots of search results featuring what look like Horizon Worlds clones of premium games competing with paid work, and sometimes winning in search rankings. “This is bad for us devs. It's bad for consumers,” states Kevin Walker. “And when they show free [Gorilla Tag] clones above paid apps, I don't see how it's even good for Meta.” Eiche and others praised the Quest Store for what it's delivered in the past, with multiple platinum releases clearing one million units. Others understand Meta's priorities, but the prevailing sentiment in our talks with developers is concern and frustration. Here's a series of selected direct quotes from the developers with paid releases on the Quest Store who wished to remain anonymous: Horizon Worlds and its free destinations competing for search, promotion, and time in VR is one aspect of paid store developer frustrations, but Meta also stopped curating content on the storefront more generally in 2024. Many studios criticized the lasting impact of Meta getting rid of App Lab last year, which arrived in two stages. Scott Albright, CEO for Combat Waffle Studios, previously told UploadVR last year that he wasn't a fan of App Lab being discontinued, and that sentiment's only grown. Many developers see the move to make the store “open” as being a good one overall because it lowers barriers to entry. One studio called it “an inevitable step” for any platform looking to grow, and a positive change. That same developer, however, suggested Meta “wasn’t ready to manage the vast amount of very unpolished content and the lack of a warning time.” “I believe that this has also shifted the type of content that gets visibility on the store now and, as a consequence, opened up its doors for developers with new approaches to VR game development and also new ways of monetization. This has caused legacy devs and publishers having to adapt to new times, which takes a while,” said another developer. Here's another set of direct quotations from developers on their issues with the changes around curation: Some studios consider the removal process was rushed, though others argue that App Lab wasn't really merged in. One team says Meta “removed the main store” and put everyone on App Lab. Eiche says they changed the store to be like Google Play or Apple's App Store, though he concedes there are arguments both ways with an open platform. In recent times, the Horizon Store's home page seems to have improved when searching on desktop or inside the headset. Though the mobile app still prioritizes mobile Horizon Worlds content when you load it up, with no means to adjust this, the desktop homepage begins by highlighting the most popular apps and top-selling that week. But it is not long before you reach the 'Browse All' category, where listed entries often have some variation on the words “Gorilla,” “Tag” or “monkey.” These often outrank Gorilla Tag itself due to inflated ratings from a small number of users. Many of those we spoke with view the Quest Store's current discoverability poorly, and worse than Steam. One developer likened it to entering a department store filled with cheap clothes during the holidays. One studio called being discovered their biggest issue next to funding, while another said navigating the store has become “unnecessarily difficult.” Another expressed frustrations that promised support over marketing and reaching the main store never materialized. Adding mixed reality labels on the developer dashboard side are still curated by Meta, yet other genres are not. Some genres in the developer settings aren’t reflected as filters on the actual store, which is causing some frustrations, while others don't show the full selection of games in a specific genre. Just how badly have developers been affected saleswise? The exact percentage naturally varies depending on who you ask, but some of those who aren't supported by a platform subscription program suggest revenue drop-offs for their games between 50 - 80% for 2024 compared to 2023. Sales impact was much more visible in the second half of 2024 for many. One studio explains that developers usually expect a big spike in sales when a new headset launches, even more so when you factor in Christmas sales. One studio says that didn't happen with Quest 3S, despite retailers like Amazon reporting high sales. “When Quest 3s launched, you couldn't even tell from the sales data that a new and affordable headset had launched… I think that this is not necessarily due to Quest 3s selling so much less, but due to those players not reaching the store and buying games,” states one studio. One developer believes Meta should implement more mechanisms like Steam Daily Deals to provide indie titles enough sales to cover months of costs. Another points toward both declining sales across the entire gaming industry and a shift toward younger audiences. “This demographic typically spends less compared to adult gamers, raising the question: where have the adult VR gamers gone?” Of course, games aren't guaranteed to be a success at launch, no matter the platform. Even with strong reviews and great marketing, games sometimes just fail to land with an audience for a myriad of reasons. Critical success doesn't equal commercial success and, for a niche market, the end of 2024 delivered a relentless stream of new releases. From October to December, the following games saw release on various platforms: And that's just some of the list. I've never seen such a hefty lineup of big VR games released in such a short timeframe. Some of that could be attributed to the Quest 3S launch, and while most developers we spoke with didn't have the most positive results, it's not impossible to break through or at least get close. In a separate interview outside this report, Flat2VR Studios advised Trombone Champ: Unflattened was close to hitting sales expectations despite the fierce competition. So there's a mix of heavy competition, poor discoverability, search issues, increasing promotion of Horizon Worlds, and a userbase that perhaps isn’t big enough to support such a wide range of games. This hasn't gone well for many, set in context of wider economic issues like the increasing cost of living leaving people with less disposable income. “There's a bigger, more insidious core problem that's happening. The amount of money that consumers are willing to spend on apps that you pay for is shrinking,” Eiche said. Owlchemy doesn't believe declining sales are necessarily due to games reaching the tail-end of their life cycle. He suggested Vacation Simulator and Cosmonious High — which recently received price cuts — have discoverability issues, while Job Simulator still regularly charts in the top 10. Even in such a high spot though, Owlchemy's debut hit is making less money than it once did. “I would love to be like, 'Hey, Job Simulator had a great run.' That's great. But then when I see it in the top 10 or in the top four but the amount it's making is an order of magnitude less, like half as much as it did before,” Eiche said. “That to me says that the overall amount of money being put into the store is shrinking.” This doesn't necessarily mean there are fewer Quest users, but it suggests more are opting for free-to-play experiences over premium content. Meta Quest+ is a subscription program providing access to two pre-selected monthly games and a rotating selection of VR titles via its Games Catalog. It's drawn the inevitable comparisons with Xbox Game Pass, and Sony's own PlayStation Plus service. Meta includes a 3-month subscription with every new Quest 3S headset, meaning anyone who received a headset over Christmas still has this. For some developers, revenue from the programs can close the gap with revenue lost from store sales. Releasing games on Quest+ immediately feels like a “double-edged sword” to some though, with games failing to reach sustainability across both store and subscription channels. Another developer expressed skepticism about subscriptions wholesale, calling the model a “catastrophic disaster” for the music industry. Others just see it as a new name for curation at Meta. “It is a great option and helps users discover great content BUT it cannot be [the] only method for doing so,” one developer said. “Which currently it is.” Some believe Quest+ gives users fewer reasons to go looking for games to purchase, stating this complements Meta's push with moving users to free apps. Despite this, most developers agreed the subscription service is great for consumers. “Quest+ is a form of curation because anything where you pick out apps is a form of curation. I think that's another line of business,” says Andrew Eiche, who calls Quest+ a good way of recommending titles. “I don’t see Meta pushing that as the answer.” With declining Quest sales being a common issue across these studios, has this lead to an uplift in sales across other headsets for multiplatform developers? Based on the developers we spoke with, generally no, but with a few notable exceptions: Still, the exceptions are interesting to note. For example, Into The Radius hit 800k sales while its currently PC VR only sequel reached nearly $3m revenue in early access so far. One CEO reported 90% of sales came from Steam compared to Quest, attributing this to being featured on the Steam front page after participating in themed sales and festivals. Another developer saw 2024 on Steam outperform their sales in 2023 and 2022. Even with Quest being their main source of revenue, one studio advised the difference with Steam is “shrinking more and more.” One studio told UploadVR lower than expected sales on Quest means they'll be focusing on multiplatform launches in the future, naming Steam as a certainty, while PS VR2 and Android XR are “maybe.” GDC's State of the Industry report, which surveyed 3500 developers, advised 59% of VR developers are working on Quest/Horizon games, 31% for SteamVR, 16% for PS VR2, and 8% for Apple visionOS. PlayStation VR2 also appears to be another beneficiary following decreased sales on Quest. Across the last few months, we've seen an increasing number of developers announce ports for Sony's headset. Sinn Studio co-founder Almir Brljak confirmed that Swordsman VR “sold more copies” on PS VR2 than Quest in December, calling the Sony headset's pricing “a huge barrier.” While not a direct indicator of sales, Skydance's Behemoth and Metro Awakening all show more user reviews on PS VR2 than Quest, though Steam shows the highest review count for Metro. Touching upon Into The Radius' success, Fast Travel Games CMO Andreas Juliusson recently stated that sales on PS VR2 “exceeded our expectations.” Elsewhere, Toast Interactive's VR platformer Max Mustard sold better on Sony's headset than Quest in the first two weeks. Some of this can be attributed to the specific audience. Max Mustard likely benefitted fulfilling a genre desire when Astro Bot lacked PS VR2 support, despite Rescue Mission being a PSVR hit, while Into The Radius and Swordsman would suggest PlayStation VR2 owners also prefer more “hardcore” experiences. Even then, one studio behind a more casual game revealed surprising sales. “We have similar numbers on Meta as we do on Steam, but much higher on PlayStation. Given the size of these platforms, it’s unclear to us how this is even possible,” a studio representative said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the increasing struggle with sales on Quest and VR in general, two studios advised they're looking more toward flatscreen gaming. Whether that's for hybrid titles going forward or flatscreen-only wasn't specified, though it's clear these decisions are motivated by financial struggles. “Compared to non-VR sales, it is increasingly feeling like we shouldn't bother with VR or MR at all,” one studio tells me, stating sales for their game's flatscreen edition on Steam outperforms the VR edition on Quest by 500%. “In my opinion, the Quest Store is not on a good path. As a result, we will see a good amount of VR studios close or pivot to non-VR in the next years, leading to a big drop in quality games 2-3 years down the line,” said one developer. A couple of developers expected layoffs and closures from many that don't pivot to flatscreen titles. With PowerWash Simulator VR support being officially dropped, other studios evidently aren't finding Quest profitable, though FuturLab's port faced criticisms at launch. Crucially, this avoided layoffs and saw the staff members redeployed to other projects. Eiche described this as a “smart business decision” because FuturLab didn’t wait until layoffs became inevitable. The last two years for many VR studios have been rough. The wider games industry remains in a rough state, tens of thousands of developers have lost their jobs and VR gaming has been hit too. WIMO Games, Archiact, First Contact Entertainment, Sony's London Studio, and Ready At Dawn have all shut down since 2023. Other big names hit by layoffs include nDreams, Lode, TinyBuild, Codemasters, VRChat, Soul Assembly, XR Games, Toast Interactive, Resolution Games, Firesprite, Humble Games, Supermassive Games, Downpour Interactive and, most recently, Fast Travel Games. We've received emails from folks looking for contract positions as some studio heads look to “work for hire” jobs to keep their workers employed. “I can still get by because I'm solo, but if I had employees there would be no way this would be sustainable,” one developer said. Some developers also highlighted their worries about Meta's recent changes to its content moderation policies across Threads, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, which includes removing fact-checking. These recent moves saw CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused of aligning himself with President Trump before his inauguration last month. Meta faced heavy criticism both from platform users and its own staff over its updated community standards guidelines, with many worried about the rise of hate speech, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia, and more. Meta also removed transgender and non-binary themes from Messenger, killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and removed accommodations for transgender staff. The current Hateful Conduct guidelines as of February 4, 2025, state the following: “We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality.” Meta Quest and Horizon Worlds use a separate Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences. Meta defines “hate-based organizations” in another policy at the company, with a page noting “we cannot estimate prevalence for organized hate right now.” Meta's moderation landscape is changing rapidly, and its efforts to scale toward billions of users continues to bend heavily toward automated systems at multiple layers. Evidence recently emerged via VR enthusiast Lunayian that Meta could be dropping moderators reviewing the last few mins of audio/video after you report other users in Horizon Worlds. One developer questioned how much longer they can ethically do business with such an organization. We intend to explore this particular area further fully in a separate report. If you have information to share with us, or in particular a developer looking to share your thoughts on Meta's recent moderation changes, please use our Contact Us page to get in touch or email me: hstockdale@uploadvr.com. Where does this leave the VR market? If you're a VR gamer, some months may seem like there are more older games getting VR mods than new VR games. Even so, there's still a slow but steady drip of indie releases from small teams, as well as occasional tentpoles from well-funded groups with dozens of artists working on a single project. Some developers are hopeful things will change for the better at Meta, while others cannot wait for Valve's rumored Deckard headset. Many praised Meta for keeping the VR market as vibrant as it has been, though another conceded VR adoption has been “slower than expected.” Another criticized the infrastructure around the platform as “suffering from serious growing pains.” One developer believes Meta is shaping the industry in an “unsustainable” direction that’s good for retention from younger audiences – free-to-play – but bad for overall revenue. Others cited concerns about the market shifting so rapidly, while one expressed caution about chasing mixed reality experiences at the expense of VR. One studio cited shifting goalposts during development on Quest as a problem, while another believes mixed reality made some developers “forget about VR.” Clear investments are being made into pushing Horizon Worlds and that's particularly true on mobile, though some remain hopeful that Meta can be persuaded into course correction. In preparation for this article, we reached out to Meta this week with a bulleted list of complaints from developers and questions we're hoping the company can answer. We were told they're preparing a blog post and will update with a link to that post once it is live. As part of our reporting, UploadVR initially put a call-out for responses to a consumer survey. However, this did not receive a wide enough response to be considered viable data for the report. For transparency, we've included a link to the full results here.

Title: Here’s What Happened After Elon Musk Cut 80% Of X’s Employees—As He Eyes Reshaping Federal Workforce
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/02/05/heres-what-happened-after-elon-musk-cut-80-of-xs-employees-as-he-eyes-reshaping-federal-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:14:59Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s campaign to get rid of 10% of the U.S.’ 2.3 million-strong federal workforce, including all 10,000 employees in the U.S. Agency for International Development, has little historic precedent, but it does evoke memories of the world’s richest man’s 2022 takeover of social media company Twitter, now known as X. Just six months after closing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Musk told the BBC he culled the company’s headcount to 1,500, down about 80% from 7,500 employees as of the end of 2021, as noted in the company’s last annual report as a public company. The dramatic restructuring came as a result of firings and voluntary resignation packages as the social media company pivoted to Musk’s “extremely hardcore” culture, laid out in an all-hands email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road.” That’s the same subject line all federal employees got last week in their email offering voluntary buyouts, an offer about 20,000—or 1%—of workers have taken thus far, while Musk and his allies have orchestrated the administrative leave of almost all USAID employees. The social media company initially took a massive financial hit as its workforce shrank. Its advertising revenue in 2023, Musk’s first full year at the helm of X, declined to a reported $2.5 billion, a more than 45% decrease from Twitter’s ad sales in 2021, its final full year as a public company, causing Fidelity to write down its valuation of X to as little as $9 billion by last September, just a fifth of the sticker price Musk paid two years prior. After Musk’s takeover, the company overhauled its operations, cutting its content moderation and communications teams, and reshaped its platform, focusing on premium monthly subscriptions and algorithm-based feeds like TikTok’s. To a degree, yes. In recent months, X has begun to show signs of recovery. Fidelity upped its X valuation to about $13 billion in December and several major advertisers, including Amazon, are renewing their presence on the platform. X’s financials recovered in 2024 on its leaner model, as Bloomberg reports X brought in $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings last year, within striking distance of 2021’s $1.4 billion, with a much leaner staff. X’s recent rebound traces back to Musk’s chummy relationship with President Donald Trump, but Musk’s activities outside of his corporate role are a big part of why the company landed in hot water in the first place. Major companies like Disney and Apple paused ads on X in late 2023 after Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, while others balked at the lack of content guardrails on the site. Very. The Musk-led push to trim 6,000 positions at X, a much smaller scale than the government job cuts he hopes to oversee, brought significant legal challenges from employees—including more than 2,000 arbitration cases, after X did not pay the severance package Musk promised, and several broader lawsuits. The fate of those lawsuits has been mixed: A federal judge tossed one lawsuit accusing him of skimping on a half-billion in severance payments, while another severance-based suit was allowed to proceed in part. Musk is taking “the same Twitter playbook now with the federal government," Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney representing many of the former Twitter/X employees in arbitration against their former employer, told NPR. "And he couldn't even come up with a new subject line for the email,” Liss-Riordan continued. In the latest signal of institutional confidence in X, banks which helped finance Musk’s 2022 acquisition plan to sell $5.5 billion of X’s debt at 97 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Government agencies do not have a similar catch-all performance metric as corporations do with the yardstick of profit, but Musk’s private sector resume shows clear evidence of operational efficiency leadership. Tesla, Musk’s most valuable company and the primary source of his wealth, grew to be an investor favorite due to its high profit margins compared to other car companies, made possible in part by its relatively lean headcount. Tesla had 141,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2023, compared to Ford’s 177,000 and General Motors’ 163,000, according to the company’s most recent proxy statements. And yet Tesla brought in $10.9 billion in net income in 2023, besting Ford’s $8.1 billion net profit and General Motors’ $10.5 billion despite the legacy automakers’ higher headcount. Musk is worth $400 billion, according to Forbes' calculations, making him the world's richest person by a roughly $150 billion margin. X accounted for less than $7 billion of his fortune as of November. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Report: Amazon Employees Say Restructuring Leaves Fewer Opportunities to Advance
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/report-amazon-employees-say-restructuring-leaves-fewer-opportunities-to-advance/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:11:01Z

Amazon’s efforts to restructure its workforce have reportedly left staffers with fewer opportunities to move up the corporate ladder. These concerns result from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to reduce the company’s middle management ranks and free up funds for its investments in data centers and artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Feb. 5). To reduce costs, the company’s organizations have been told to hire recent college graduates, find reasons to remove more senior workers, and have fewer managers as compared to front-line workers, according to the report. Most employees interviewed by Bloomberg said Amazon had become a less desirable place to work, per the report. Together with the reduction in the number of opportunities to advance their careers, some cited the company’s cutbacks on projects like cashierless checking and telehealth and its requirement to return to the office five days a week. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Bloomberg, per the report, that the reduction in the number of managers “impacts a relatively small subset of employees and aims to increase our team members’ ability to move fast, clarify and strengthen their sense of ownership, and drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most affects customers and the business. Each organization is determining the best way to reach this goal, and our internal surveys show that employee sentiment remains strong.” Jassy wrote in a message shared with Amazon’s employees and posted online in September that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In the case of managers, Jassy said Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Amazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the event will include news from its Alexa team. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, will also be in attendance, according to invites sent to media. Amazon has been racing to release a new version of its voice-activated Alexa software that has more advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. It is responding to increased competition in generative AI from rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, as well as Claude, the chatbot created by AI startup Anthropic, which has raised billions of dollars from Amazon and other investors. Amazon executives have scheduled a "Go/No-go" meeting for Feb. 14 in preparation for releasing the souped-up Alexa to the public, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The company first previewed a redesigned Alexa in 2023, showing off a live conversation between an Amazon executive and the voice assistant as part of a yet-to-be-released feature called Let's Chat. Amazon shared few details following that event about further Alexa updates, and it did not hold its typical fall event in 2024, at which it typically announces new products. CNBC reported last year that Amazon was preparing to revamp Alexa with AI features, and that it would charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology. In October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told investors the new Alexa could launch "in the near future," adding that the company is working to "rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models." Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across Amazon since late 2022, and the company's devices and services unit, which includes Alexa, has been hit by several rounds of layoffs. Since its launch in 2014, Alexa has not shaped up to be the money maker Amazon anticipated. While hundreds of millions of customers have Alexa-enabled devices in their homes, Amazon has struggled to monetize the products. The company has traditionally launched devices at extremely cheap prices with the goal of promoting its other products and services. That idea has not been as successful as Amazon hoped, and the company has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices business, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Title: The Smartest Investment: How ‘Quality Jobs’ Drive Profits

The American workplace is in crisis. In 2024, Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace Report quantified what everyone already knew: 33 percent of U.S. workers are “engaged,” 51 percent are “not engaged,” and 16 percent are “actively disengaged.” Looking only at those numbers, you’d be forgiven for wondering whether there was some sort of collective, corporate effort to make Americans hate what they do for a living. As Charlie Munger famously said, “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Across centuries, political divides and academic disciplines, one idea remains clear: quality jobs are the foundation of thriving markets, strong economies and healthy societies. Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, emphasized in The Theory of Moral Sentiments that markets require moral foundations. More recently, MIT professor Zeynep Ton reinforced this principle, showing that companies with strong job quality strategies see 30-40 percent lower turnover, 20-30 percent higher productivity and 15 to 25 percent higher customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, in What Happened to Capitalism?, Oren Cass points to a stark reality: over the past 50 years, corporate profits have soared 185 percent, while wages have grown just 1 percent. A “quality job” encompasses several key attributes that collectively enhance the well-being and satisfaction of employees. These positions offer fair compensation, ensuring that workers receive wages commensurate with their skills and experience. Beyond monetary rewards, quality jobs provide comprehensive benefits packages, including health insurance and retirement plans, which contribute to long-term financial security. Such roles also offer opportunities for professional growth through training and development programs, enabling employees to advance their careers. Moreover, quality jobs foster a positive work environment characterized by respect, inclusivity and a healthy work-life balance, ensuring employees feel valued and supported. Collectively, these elements improve individual job satisfaction and enhance overall productivity and organizational commitment. The increasingly stark contrast between profits and wages has led to growing calls for change. In 2019, the Business Roundtable made history when 181 CEOs renounced shareholder primacy and embraced stakeholder capitalism. They committed to investing in employees through fair compensation, benefits, training and workplace dignity. Johnson & Johnson pioneered this stakeholder approach with their 1943 credo, explicitly recognizing responsibilities to employees before shareholders as a precondition to generating sustainable profits. For many, the results speak for themselves: Costco (COST) pays its workers an average of $25 per hour with 13 percent turnover versus the industry’s 60 percent. Southwest Airlines introduced its profit-sharing program in 1974 and boasts a 4 percent employee turnover rate. Nucor Steel maintains a no-layoffs policy through downturns and shares profits directly with workers; in 2023, this translated to almost $1 billion in profit sharing for the company’s nearly 31,000 employees. Others offer cautionary tales. In 2019, McDonald’s announced it would no longer lobby against raising workers’ pay, indicating previous resistance to wage increases. Despite this shift, the company has faced challenges in attracting workers, leading to wage increases in 2021 to address a “challenging hiring environment.” And though Amazon promised better worker treatment, union battles, high injury rates and reports of worker surveillance were just a few of the headlines that made issues for Jeff Bezos last year. Of course, Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald’s remain highly successful, profitable and growing companies. But imagine how much more impactful they could be—both economically and reputationally—if they fully embraced the commitments they made in 2019. Their influence is undeniable; the question is whether they’ll use it to set a new standard or simply maintain the status quo. Investing in quality jobs isn’t just an honorable choice—it’s a financial one. Higher wages, predictable schedules and training programs reduce turnover, cut recruitment costs and boost output. Southwest Airlines, Nucor and Costco aren’t simply doing the right thing; they’re outcompeting their peers because of it. I coined the term “Patriotic Capitalism” to refer to the notion of an economic and investment framework that prioritizes country, democracy and the common good as the way forward for national prosperity. This framework aligns with the vision of an economy where people can contribute productively to their communities, support their families and raise children prepared to do the same. Beyond ethics, it’s essential for national competitiveness in a world where human capital determines success. In addition to policy changes, attitude shifts across C-suites and boards are necessary. Superior operational design and a focus on human capital investment can generate enhanced and sustainable financial returns. Research conducted by a global private equity firm found that companies whose senior management had the highest levels of empathy generated the highest financial returns. Authentic empathy engages workers; engaged workers drive innovation, productivity and profitability. Quality jobs go beyond fair pay—they lay the foundation for innovation and productive investment. The framework is straightforward, comprising common-sense elements like broad-based employee ownership, fair compensation, predictable schedules and meaningful training. The evidence is clear: quality jobs strengthen companies, build resilient communities and enhance national competitiveness. Businesses that embrace this approach aren’t just doing good; they’re gaining a sustainable competitive edge. The choice isn’t between profitability and good jobs—that’s a false dichotomy that both Adam Smith and modern research debunk. Yes, raising wages and offering ownership requires an upfront investment—but high turnover, low morale and worker disengagement already cost U.S. businesses billions annually. Paying employees better isn’t charity; it’s a calculated business strategy that leads to higher productivity, stronger brand loyalty, and better long-term returns. Quality jobs are the smartest investment a company can make in its future. And in today’s global economy, they might be the smartest investment America can make in its future, too.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: Turmoil as ADM trims 700 jobs, Salesforce slashes 1,000 after Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon axe

Significant layoffs continue to sweep across major big tech and corporate firms in 2025. Following similar decisions by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Salesforce have joined the expanding list of industry titans trimming their staff. According to Reuters, ADM, a major international grain trader, announced plans to cut up to 700 jobs to reduce expenses by $500 million to $750 million over the next three to five years. Juan Luciano, the company's CEO, stated that "softer market conditions and policy uncertainty" were the main reasons for these layoffs. The action comes as ADM adapts to a shifting global market environment, with difficulties expected in the upcoming year. According to a Bloomberg News report, Salesforce plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees while simultaneously hiring new ones to promote the sales of its new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The story (quoting a source familiar with the matter) said the displaced workers could apply for other roles within the organisation. However, it is yet unknown how the layoffs will impact particular divisions. The announcements follow similar moves by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, which also implemented widespread layoffs in reaction to market instability, industry changes, and economic challenges. Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, resulting in the affected employees losing their jobs with immediate effect and without any severance pay. Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, is laying off about 3,600 people, or 5% of its staff, according to a Bloomberg report that cited an internal memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Employees impacted will be informed by February 10. In the memo, Zuckerberg wrote, “I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.” According to reports, Amazon intends to make significant layoffs, possibly removing up to 14,000 administrative positions by the beginning of 2025. According to data from a Morgan Stanley paper referenced in news sources, this action is expected to result in significant cost savings of about $3 billion annually. Meanwhile, according to Business Insider, the company is letting go of about 200 workers in the US in its ‘Fashion and Fitness’ division.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be." Read more here. Vaccine stocks Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), and BioNTech SE (BNTX) all fell following news that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Estée Lauder Laments ‘Lost Agility’ and Cuts up to 7K Jobs

Consumer pullback around the world is leading Estée Lauder to cut thousands of jobs. The beauty brand released earnings Tuesday (Feb. 4) showing declining or flat sales in its markets around the globe, especially in Asia, where sales fell by double digits. Speaking to analysts during an earnings call, CEO Stéphane de La Faverie discussed some of the factors that have hurt the company’s performance in recent years, including “subdued” consumer sentiment in China and a “narrow focus” on too few markets. “This was especially true in North America. Simply said we lost our agility,” de La Faverie said. “We did not capitalize on the higher growth opportunities quickly enough. In channels, markets, media and prestige price tiers nor fuel new consumer acquisition aggressively enough.” To that end, the company is embarking on a turnaround campaign that involves the elimination of 5,800 to 7,000 jobs, though that number takes into account reductions of employees after retraining and redeployment of some workers. Estée Lauder says it also plans to expand its presence in certain channels and markets to take part in “key growth opportunities in prestige beauty” while also boosting consumer-facing investments by increasing ad spending. “We know we didn’t make fast move in terms of new distribution when the consumer was moving,” de La Faverie added. “That’s what we’ve demonstrated with the move that we’ve made a few months ago with Amazon and many of us like TikTok Shop in Asia and even in the U.S. So we’re going to really measure how quickly we move in this channel and how much we can like to capture lapsed consumers but also new consumers.” The company also recently teamed with OpenAI recently to implement artificial intelligence (AI) across its brands. The companies developed 240 AI applications to analyze consumer data and create products for its various brands. “The facility processes data from consumer surveys and clinical trials for the company’s beauty brands,” that report said. “Two primary applications have emerged from the development process: one analyzes consumer survey data for fragrance development, while another processes clinical trial results.” As PYMNTS wrote at the time, other beauty companies are also investing in AI for consumer-facing and product development. For example, L’Oréal expanded its use of Modiface, an AI and augmented reality platform that allows users to virtually try on makeup and experiment with hair colors. And Sephora’s Virtual Artist tool lets customers find their ideal foundation shade using facial recognition and a skin tone database, improving accuracy and inclusivity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The Federation of National Trade Unions, known as CSN, said Tuesday it plans to petition a court to order Amazon to reopen seven warehouses and restore the 1,700 jobs lost as a result of the closures. Amazon announced in late January it would phase out seven sites in Quebec "following a recent review" of its operations in the province, which is the only location in Canada with unionized Amazon employees. The company said it would return to a third-party delivery model, enlisting subcontractors to handle deliveries. The CSN estimated that roughly 4,500 jobs were cut by Amazon and its subcontractors as a result of the closures. "Amazon thinks it can just shift the work to other corporate entities and outsource some warehousing and delivery operations," CSN President Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "What it calls the 'new business model' is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon's workers." Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said reverting to a third-party delivery model, which it used in Quebec before 2020, will allow the company to "provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run." "In making this decision, we've complied and will continue to comply with all the applicable federal and provincial laws," Agrait said in a statement. The CSN represents roughly 240 Amazon workers at a warehouse near the Montreal suburb of Laval. Workers at the site unionized last May, becoming the first Amazon warehouse in Canada to do so. Following the closures, Canada's industry minister, Francoise-Philippe Champagne, wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressing his "disappointment" over the decision, saying it "raises questions about your commitment to Canada and your Canadian partners." Champagne said the government would consider conducting a review of its current deals with Amazon. Amazon said the vice president of its Canada business spoke with Champagne after the company announced the closures. The company also faces growing labor pressure in the U.S. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union, while Whole Foods workers in Philadelphia voted Jan. 27 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Amazon employees at a facility in Staten Island, New York, in 2022 formed the company's first union at a U.S. warehouse, though they have yet to secure a contract. The group voted to affiliate with the Teamsters in June. WATCH: Tariffs' toll on e-commerce Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Tech layoffs this year: A timeline

2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies. Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. As it moves to invest more in AI and international growth, Workday is laying off 8.5% of its workforce and disposing of unused office space. Some analysts fear the cutbacks will affect the company’s customer service — unless AI can pick up the slack. At the same time as it’s hiring sales staff for its new artificial intelligence products, Salesforce is laying off over 1,000 workers across the company, according to Bloomberg. As of June, 2024, the company had over 72,000 employees, according to its website. Salesforce did not comment on the report. In 2024 the company reportedly laid off around 1,000 staff too, in two waves: January and July. Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees he intended to “move out the low performers faster” in an internal memo reported by Bloomberg. The memo announced that the company will lay off 5% of its staff, or around 3,600 staff, beginning Feb. 10. The company had already reduced its headcount by 5% in 2024 through natural attrition, the memo said. Among those leaving the company will be staff previously responsible for fact checking of posts on its social media platforms in the US, as the company begins relying on its users to police content. Despite intense demand for its data center capacity, Equinix is planning to lay off 3% of its workforce, or around 400 employees. The announcement followed the appointment of Adaire Fox-Martin to replace Charles Meyers as CEO and the departures of two other senior executives, CIO Milind Wagle and CISO Michael Montoya. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce. After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.

After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there were early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continued to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs seen through the year were an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. Here’s a round-up of some of the most significant. See news of more recent layoffs. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said.

AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications. Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Roughly 8% of Microsoft’s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lion’s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition. German enterprise software giant SAP said this week that 8,000 jobs will be “impacted” by a large-scale shift in company priorities towards generative artificial intelligence (genAI). It’s unclear how many of the affected employees will be laid off, as the company has said many of the impacts will involve “voluntary leave programs and internal re-skilling measures.” SAP said the restructuring will not result in an overall loss of headcount. The company cut more than 3,000 jobs in 2023. Analysts expect the move to skew SAP’s workforce younger and more expert in genAI. Online retailer eBay plans to cut nearly 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 jobs—saying “in an official blog post that “headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business.” All of the company’s US workforce was told to work from home Wednesday as the firings were carried out via Zoom. Additionally, eBay said it would “scale back” on its work with outside contractors in a further attempt to rein in costs. The company fired 500 workers last year after sales slackened in the wake of the pandemic boom, according to NPR. Google’s ad sales team lost several hundred staff from its large customer department, part of the company’s move to automate some jobs with machine learning. Reports suggest that more staffers from the ad sales team were also let go in October 2023. The company also laid off hundreds more employees from its digital voice assistant, Fitbit, and Pixel teams earlier in the week. Google has been steadily shedding jobs since January 2023, when parent company Alphabet downsized its entire workforce by 6% across the board, putting 12,000 people out of work. Alphabet announced that it is laying off hundreds of employees from several teams, including engineering and the teams responsible for its digital voice assistant and hardware products, including Fitbit wearable devices and Pixel smartphones. The reorganization of the hardware teams will see a consolidation of different teams responsible for different devices, such as Nest, Pixel, and Fitbit, combined under a single team, which will be responsible for all devices, the news portal reported, adding that the activity has also seen the departure of Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman.

Title: Salesforce Reportedly Cuts 1,000 Jobs While Adding AI Salespeople

Salesforce is reportedly eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company, Bloomberg reported Monday (Feb. 3), citing unnamed sources. It wasn’t clear which divisions were affected by the layoffs, the report said. Salesforce, a provider of customer management software, had nearly 73,000 employees as of January 2024, when its previous fiscal year closed. Salesforce did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Tech companies have gotten used to routine job cuts following a surge of layoffs in early 2023, according to the report. Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all announced cuts so far this year. Meanwhile, Salesforce has been hiring people for its new AI agent products, while also focusing on shoring up profit margins following pressure from activist investors in 2023, the report said. “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,” Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said when asked about the company’s profit focus in December, per the report. “We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?’” Last month, Salesforce debuted a point-of-sale (POS) operating system built on generative AI. “We’re not here to complement the status quo — we’re here to replace it,” Salesforce Senior Vice President and General Manager for Retail Nitin Mangtani told PYMNTS after the launch. “Retailers need technology that doesn’t just power transactions but transforms the entire shopping experience from discovery to checkout. That’s what this GenAI-powered POS is built to do.” Businesses must respect today’s fluid consumer journeys, which cover both physical and digital touchpoints, he said. For example, a consumer might happen upon a product while watching a TikTok video, buy it online, and exchange it in-store. “Unified commerce is not just a buzzword,” Mangtani said. “It’s table stakes. The consumer journey today is so intertwined that attributing success to one channel is nearly impossible.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Leftist Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Slashes Jobs to Prepare for AI Takeover

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a notorious leftist, is cutting over 1,000 jobs as the company’s new fiscal year begins, even as it ramps up hiring for AI-focused sales positions. Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Salesforce has announced it will be eliminating more than 1,000 roles as part of a restructuring effort coinciding with the start of its new fiscal year. The job cuts come despite the company simultaneously embarking on a hiring spree for salespeople specializing in its new AI agent products. According to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the private nature of the information, the affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific divisions impacted by the layoffs have not been disclosed. As of January 2024, Salesforce boasted a workforce of nearly 73,000 employees. The move by Salesforce reflects a growing trend among technology companies to implement regular job reductions, following a significant wave of layoffs that swept the industry in early 2023. This year alone, tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have all taken steps to trim their corporate workforces. While Salesforce is cutting jobs in certain areas, the company is also actively expanding its sales team to promote its new AI agent products. This dual approach highlights the company’s focus on maintaining profitability and efficiency, a priority that has been emphasized since activist investors applied pressure in 2023. In a December event hosted by Barclays Plc, Salesforce’s Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham addressed the company’s commitment to balancing growth and profitability, stating, “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business. We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?'” Breitbart News previously reported that Salesforce CEO was one of the many Silicon Valley leaders to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump after his stunning election victory in November: The turnabout is particularly striking given the extreme leftist politics of some executives now meeting with or praising Trump. Salesforce CEO and hyperleftist Marc Benioff, who owns Time Magazine, posted on X celebrating “a time of great promise for our nation” after Time named Trump its “Person of the Year.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

Title: Return-to-office policies are leading to increased brain drain in the U.S.

Time Published: 2025-02-04T14:08:50Z

Return-to-office mandates are emerging as one of the most contentious of the post-pandemic work trends that U.S. employees have faced. Last year, Gartner data identified that 63% of HR leaders reported an increase in expectations for employees to return to the office. That was even from those organizations which had made a firm commitment to remote working during the COVID-19 crisis. Hybrid policies were initially seen as a good measure, providing flexibility to workers. But this turns out to have been just an interim approach as companies began to row back on flexibility. That is in part because many companies have seen low compliance, according to Gartner’s data, and as a result many are resorting to full RTO mandates. Over the past few months, Amazon, JPMorgan and AT&T are just three of the companies which have been under the spotlight for their insistence that staff come back into the office a full five days per week. More recently, President Trump announced his plans to shrink the government, via the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). One of its mandates is to get federal workers back into the office. Those who don’t want to do that are eligible for a buyout worth seven months of salary. It may just be an effective way to achieve another of President Trump’s goals: a “reformed federal workforce.” In doing so, the President has effectively said the quiet part out loud. “We think a very substantial number of people will not show up to work, and therefore our government will get smaller and more efficient,” he has said. But tech and finance institutions have so far mostly dressed up return-to-office mandates under the guise of improving productivity and fostering collaboration. However, many companies calculate that a percentage of workers won’t want to come back, and will therefore quit. It’s a soft way to conduct layoffs, and manages to sidestep the organizational shock around traditional layoffs. Unsurprisingly, according to Gartner’s study, 74% of HR leaders cite these mandates as a source of conflict. Another unintended consequence of RTO is that while companies hope underperforming people will leave, some of the best talent in a business or organization will go too. A new research paper puts extra detail on this. The paper, titled Return to Office Mandates and Brain Drain, tracked over three million tech and finance workers’ employment histories via LinkedIn. “We find that these firms experience abnormally high employee turnover following RTO mandates. The increase in turnover rates is more pronounced for female employees, more senior employees and more skilled employees.” the reports authors state. And the paper also finds that getting rid of swathes of workers isn’t necessarily the panacea leaders may think it is. It takes a significantly longer time for these firms to fill their job vacancies after the mandates, the report has found. “Their hire rates also significantly decrease. These results are consistent with firms losing their best talent and female employees and facing greater difficulties with talent attraction after RTO mandates.” Some of those highly-skilled, highly-paid employees are leaving for remote working opportunities. This is borne out by figures from Ladders, a career site for six-figure positions. It recently found that 10.4% of jobs offering salaries of $250,000 or more were advertised as remote in the third quarter of 2024. That was up from 8.8% in the second quarter of the year. If you’re experiencing the demands of a return-to-office mandate at your current employer, then looking for a new job may be your next step.

Title: Salesforce plans over 1,000 job cuts amid AI hiring push

Salesforce is set to eliminate more than 1,000 positions as it enters its new fiscal year. According to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the job reductions coincide with ongoing hiring efforts to expand the company’s sales team for AI products. A source familiar with the matter told the news agency that affected employees would have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific departments impacted by the layoffs were not disclosed. Salesforce previously reported a total workforce of approximately 72,682 employees as of 31 January 2024. The firm has carried out multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year. In January 2024, Salesforce let go 700 of its employees, followed by an additional 300 in July. Despite the reductions, the cloud-based software firm continues to hire for AI-related roles. In particular, Salesforce has expanded its sales team to support Agentforce, an AI-powered virtual representative platform. CEO Marc Benioff announced in December 2024 that Salesforce had secured over 1,000 paid deals for the product, which automates tasks such as responding to customer inquiries and assessing potential sales opportunities. Salesforce’s enterprise cloud portfolio remains a key driver of revenue growth. The company’s data cloud and AI-driven tools, including Agentforce, have seen strong adoption among enterprise clients seeking to streamline workflows and manage large volumes of data. On its most recent earnings call, executives emphasised the role of Agentforce in the company’s strategy. Salesforce has been investing heavily in the platform’s expansion, with plans to hire 1,400 new employees in the fourth quarter to meet growing demand. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, released in December 2024. It reported $9.44bn in revenue for the quarter ending 31 October 2024, an 8% increase from the previous year. Salesforce raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $37.8bn to $38bn, slightly above its prior forecast. Earnings per share (EPS) projections were also revised upward to a range of $6.15 to $6.2. in addition, subscription and support revenue, which represents the bulk of the company’s income, increased by 9% YoY to $8.88bn. Operating cash flow surged 29% YoY to $1.98bn, while free cash flow rose 30% to $1.78bn. Salesforce is set to report fourth-quarter earnings later this month, which may provide further insight into its workforce strategy and AI expansion plans. The restructuring at Salesforce reflects the broader trend throughout the technology sector of companies restructuring their workforces in response to AI-driven changes and shifting business priorities. Over the past year, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all announced job cuts as they focus on emerging technologies and operational efficiencies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet. Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them. We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast. On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world. We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama – Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning. These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges. So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China. This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not," he wrote on his social media platform, "but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances. So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers? ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks. Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs – quote – "will put your jobs at risk," potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: "If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups." And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama? ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal. The Panamanians insist they have full control – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed. We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if – avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is a – remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower – saying he was going to lower grocery prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war. Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened. (Begin VT) SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is – according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor. FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional. SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen? FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden – she called him a brave whistle-blower – couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that – what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number – our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that – as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But – and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called – or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: … that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities – agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation – that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were – almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations? This would be devastating. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's – well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret – Margaret, it – we have seen – but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like – it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for. But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air – the crash. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them? SENATOR MARK WARNER: … without legal authority. Pardon me. Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to – is it being offered to air traffic controllers? SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is – I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs. What happens if they all quit? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you – and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment. I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away? SENATOR MARK WARNER: No. I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo. Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example – down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was – President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid. These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing… MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad… MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … when it should be the American worker's dollar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … which is a – separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell – yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents… MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently. And let's make another point on this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress – Congress authorizes and earmarks funding. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars – most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure. I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say – this is a little bit hyperbole – but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about – you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change. MARGARET BRENNAN: … efficiencies in aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's… MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what? MARGARET BRENNAN: But… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place? MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put – that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility – disability. Excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it. Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal – a personal aircraft. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. Good morning to you, Senator. Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe. But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: … not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator – Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it. Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break. I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen. (BEGIN VC) SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine? (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy. But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism - MARGARET BRENNAN: But - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that - MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower. And, by the way, it's not just health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address. MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane. And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out? FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of "The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions. Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, "line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do." Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here. But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation? SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning. Good morning. You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing? HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today. He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon? HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure? HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did. I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them. So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, "it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through? HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu. This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through. I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three. HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen - HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well. HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk. HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And congratulations. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's great news. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we go, "CBS Evening News" co-anchor and presidential historian John Dickerson has some thoughts on the tone of those Oval Office moments following tragedy. (BEGIN VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): After the deadliest air crash in 20 years in America, President Trump responded, as presidents have before. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Differences fade because we are all reminded of the basic truth, that we are all human and life is fragile. In such rare moments, a president can transform private grief into public meaning. These presidential moments live in our collective memory. Ronald Reagan addressing the nation after the Challenger disaster. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): George W. Bush at Ground Zero. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The nation sends its love and compassion. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Barack Obama singing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (singing): Amazing grace. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In speech, by bull horn, in song, and now, by executive memorandum. That's how Donald Trump used the Oval Office where Reagan had eulogized the Challenger astronauts. Though the president had earlier declared an hour of anguish for our nation, for him, the hour only lasted a few minutes. He spent much of the remainder of this unique moment distributing blame. TRUMP: I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The starkest claim, the one behind the Oval Office signing ceremony, that diversity programs had caused the crash that killed 67. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a presidential memorandum titled Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety. In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): When asked what proof he had that diversity was the culprit, and the president said he had no proof but didn't need any. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash. TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK. And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The president's certainty about the crash, despite the lack of proof, suggested for many Americans that the common sense he was referring to was that diversity means things automatically go wrong when people of color are in charge. In one press conference he traveled the entire length of the emotional register, from asserting that the differences between Americans fade to returning the focus to those differences. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: What's in store for remote work and RTO in 2025: 'Hybrid will be dominant,' says expert

Related Stories With the new year comes new goals, and for some CEOs that includes issuing fresh return-to-office mandates for their workers. In recent months, companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell and Walmart have called select staffers into the office five days a week. RTO marching orders reached the White House after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all department and agency heads in the executive branch to "terminate remote work arrangements" and require workers report to offices full-time "as soon as practicable." Shortly after, the Trump administration offered buyouts to nearly all civilian federal workers to quit by Feb. 6. The trend could trigger waves of quitting and disengagement at work, though, experts warn, especially among high performers. Nearly half, 46%, of hybrid and remote workers said they would be unlikely to stay in their job if their employer called them back to offices full-time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,200 people in October. Some companies may hope that work-from-home holdouts will quit rather than comply. Companies that plan to cut hiring significantly are more likely to impose RTO mandates than expand remote-work opportunities, according to research from ZipRecruiter; they also report higher turnover rates. In the past, the workers most likely to quit after the institution of an RTO mandate tended to be highly skilled and tenured star employees, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh. The study, which analyzed companies in the S&P 500, found firms that cut workplace flexibility experienced "abnormally high turnover," especially among women, senior and skilled employees. These companies took "significantly longer" to fill vacancies and saw their hire rates "significantly decrease," researchers noted. Thanks to a tougher job market for workers than a few years ago, those who want to quit but don't have anywhere to go are likely to stay and be a drain on worker engagement, says Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. "I might try to do the minimum so I won't be fired, then start looking for the next job. And once I find a better position, I will leave," Ma says. "So it's not an ideal situation for the employer." A better approach to reducing headcount is to conduct targeted layoffs of lower performers, Ma says. As of October 2024, a majority of workers, 53%, said finding a new job they want would be difficult, up from 37% of people who felt that way in 2022, according to Pew data. That's unlikely to entirely deter the nearly half of workers who would try to quit given stricter RTO mandates from their company. "It shows how much they really do value the flexibility that comes with hybrid work," says Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center. Generally, Ma expects "some form of hybrid will be dominant, rather than a five-day return-to-office." Of the S&P 500 firms he and his co-researchers studied in 2024, just 10 announced full-time returns for some of its staff throughout the year, he says. "Based on the data we are observing, I do not think the majority of companies will do that," he says. "Most firms have already figured out their hybrid policy by now. Unless something goes wrong, I don't think they will try to change that position." While 31% of businesses reduced remote-work options in 2024, 33% expanded them, according to ZipRecruiter data compiled from more than 2,000 hiring managers. Bigger companies may have more leverage to issue RTO requirements because they can offer more money and still attract a larger candidate pool, Ma says. However, smaller companies that can't offer as competitive pay might instead offer more flexibility as a non-salary benefit to attract hires. "Not many small firms are following," Ma says.
