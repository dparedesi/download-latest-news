We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At the end of 2022, Spotify (SPOT) stock was trading below $80 a share after a disastrous year for investors that erased over $35 billion from the company's market cap. Today, shares are trading at just under $500. The audio giant is on track to hit full-year profitability for the first time ever. And its market cap? About $100 billion, up from just $15 billion two years ago. The company's colossal run-up in stock price follows an intense business overhaul that's included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts, an area it had aggressively pursued. At the company's 2022 Investor Day, Spotify set seemingly lofty objectives that included long-term gross margin targets between 30% and 35%. At the time, the company had been struggling to turn a profit, with its gross margin stuck at around 25%. In the most recent quarter, Spotify said its gross margin increased to 31.1% from the prior year's 26.4%. "We've never been in a stronger position, thanks to what's really been an outstanding execution by the Spotify team," CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fiscal third quarter earnings call in November. He added, "We are where we set out to be, if not a little bit further, and on a steady path toward achieving our long-term goals." Wall Street analysts who cover Spotify have a median price target of just around $486 a share with 29 Buy ratings, eight Holds, and just three Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. Spotify, one of the stock market's big pandemic-era trades, saw shares balloon in early 2021 as the company sought to broaden its business from music streaming to other areas of the audio market. At the time, the company's endeavors echoed moves from other tech giants in pursuit of that goal. Think heavy spending on hiring and deep-pocketed investments in growth initiatives. For Spotify, that was podcasts. Between 2019 and 2021, Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market, signing on celebrities like the Obamas, Prince Harry, and Kim Kardashian. The company paid $230 million to acquire podcast studio Gimlet in 2019. Spotify then paid a reported $200 million to bring Joe Rogan exclusively to the platform, and another $200 million for the Ringer in 2020. But the spending era was short-lived as investors and analysts began to focus on the company's lack of profitability and cash flow issues, questioning the staying power of the business model and the credibility of CEO Daniel Ek. It's hard to make money in the audio streaming business, largely due to the sky-high price of content. And compared to its main competitors — deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) — Spotify has had an even tougher time absorbing those costs. At the same time, companies in the space have to invest to expand their offerings to win market share. At Spotify, not only was spending aggressive, but a soft advertising market further crimped profit margins. Management attempted to assuage fears with promises that 2022 was a peak investment year and that profitability metrics would begin to improve in 2023. Skepticism still rang high. "Heading into 2023, investors looked at their targets and thought they were very overly ambitious," Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne told Yahoo Finance in an interview. "It really wasn't until they started to see the company make some proactive moves to drive both top-line growth, but also improve the profits of the company, that investors started to come back to the stock." Turnaround efforts first began in early 2023 as the company reorganized and consolidated business units. It adjusted its podcast strategy to focus more on reaching bigger audiences as opposed to maintaining exclusive content. It also changed up its royalty structure to combat streaming fraud and curb the massive volume of music on the platform, which has escalated as a result of generative AI. But the changes picked up steam over the course of last year, culminating in the fourth quarter when "two really important things happened as it relates to the stock performance," Swinburne said. No. 1, in Swinburne's view, was price increases. Spotify implemented a broad set of price hikes across roughly 70% of its footprint by revenue in mid-2023. The hikes were "much larger and broader than they'd ever done before as a company," the analyst said. Second: massive cost-cutting. The company laid off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, in December 2023. This followed a combined 800 employees who were laid off earlier in the year as a result of several restructurings. At the time, the significant reduction in headcount was estimated to lead to approximately 300 million euros ($315 million) in annualized cost savings for fiscal year 2024. "I don't know if I've ever seen a company take that aggressive of cost action while their revenue growth was accelerating, but it was happening at the same time the price increases were being put into place," Swinburne said. "So you had this dual effect of faster revenue growth combined with reduced expenses, which really set the company up into 2024 with a rapidly improving profit profile." Soon after the December layoffs, Spotify also announced that its CFO Paul Vogel would step down from his position after eight years. Vogel, who joined Spotify in 2016 as head of investor relations before taking over the CFO role in 2020, exited his position on March 31. Christian Luiga has since stepped into the role. The efforts didn't stop there. This year, Spotify has doubled down on another growth area with massive potential: audiobooks. "The audiobooks launch is much bigger than audiobooks," Swinburne explained. "It's really about transitioning Spotify from a music-only service to a bundle." The company introduced a higher-priced audio "bundle" that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It also rolled out an audiobooks-only plan and a music-only streaming tier in an effort to cater to a variety of consumers. The changes allowed the company to increase prices for the second time in less than a year. "Spotify was able to show the value of the product to consumers because it had no noticeable churn increase from all of the pricing changes," Swinburne said. "And then, because they transitioned to a bundle, the margins of the business got meaningfully better." To that point, the long-term gross margin goal of 30% to 35% Ek set out for has already been achieved, with the metric once again expected to climb in the fourth quarter to 31.8%. "I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.

Title: Insider Today: Blackstone's holiday cheer

Time Published: 2024-12-22T11:44:01Z

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. You've likely heard the term "supercommuter," but you might have wondered… why? Someone who does it from Washington, DC, to NYC admits she's not sure the job is worth the commute. Still, she's not regretting doing it. On the agenda today: But first: Blackstone's feeling festive. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Blackstone released its annual holiday video for the seventh consecutive year, which might elicit the reaction: Why is a firm managing $1 trillion worried about holiday videos? The videos — full of self-deprecating jokes and Blackstone-backed product placement (of course) — have become a bit of an annual tradition on Wall Street. Last year's notched 8 million views across platforms, a spokesman told BI. We've got a full rundown and ranking of all seven videos here. Some people are laughing at Blackstone as opposed to with Blackstone, but that's kind of the point. In an industry full of super serious people doing super serious business for super serious clients, Blackstone's willing to make itself the butt of the joke. Ok, yes, there is a business case for the videos. Jay Gillespie, the head of Blackstone's video team and one of the brains behind the holiday extravaganza, spoke to BI's Alex Nicoll about the evolution of his role at the firm. Blackstone's not alone in its outside-the-box approach to marketing on the Street. More firms are getting a bit — to borrow a phrase from my British colleagues — cheeky in pitching themselves to the general public. Take BlackRock, which a few years ago took to social media to make clear it's not Blackstone. (The firms have a long history together and have sometimes lean into the confusion between the two. BlackRock CEO and cofounder Larry Fink made a cameo in Blackstone's holiday video this year: "Can you believe people confuse US for THEM?") Wall Street's marketing frenzy isn't foolproof. For an industry that prides itself on what kind of business you are bringing to a firm, marketing's impact isn't as direct as landing a massive deal or hitting the perfect trade. Wealthy musicians received millions of dollars from the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, a pandemic relief program intended for struggling independent venues and arts groups. However, stars like Lil Wayne and Chris Brown used the program as a piggy bank to keep the party going, exclusive reporting from BI shows. Thousands of pages of accounting documents reveal how artists directed millions in taxpayer funds toward their own bank accounts, luxury purchases, and entertainment expenses — often outweighing what they spent on touring crew members. How musicians spent the grant money. Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, a Spanish duchess, devoted much of her life to cataloging the Archive of Medina-Sidonia, a priceless collection that had been in her family for generations. Comprising of 6 million documents, the archive details the secrets of the kings, dukes, and explorers of medieval Spain. After Luisa Isabel died, she left her three children just 743,000 euros. However, the bulk of her estate — and control of the archives — went to the woman she'd married on her deathbed. What ensued after was a bitter legal battle that would shatter the family, captivate Spain, and throw the fate of the archives into doubt. Inside the palace showdown. There is perhaps no real-estate metric more loved — and loathed — than Zillow's automated home valuation tool. The Zestimate draws casual clickers to the site, whether it's to lurk on previous residences, friends' or colleagues' homes, or the value of your neighbor's property against yours. The problem is that the Zestimate is often misguided, and Americans' obsession with it can create crushing reality checks when homes actually hit the market. But that's not a problem for Zillow. Earlier this month, Citigroup welcomed 34 managing directors, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, however, the bank's promotion process can be political and pit employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told BI. The bank rates its employees on a forced curve, assessing them from best to worst. These rankings influence whether an employee might receive a promotion or lose their bonus. Managing directors break down how it works. This week's quote: "What we're having to speak of already sounds like we're lying — it already sounds like a movie because it's so horrible." — Adria English worked as a dancer at Sean "Diddy" Combs' famous white parties and filed a lawsuit in July accusing him of sex trafficking. Combs has vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault and sex trafficking.

Title: Pensacola Big Lots and Party City employees face sudden layoffs before holiday season

Time Published: 2024-12-21T14:00:29Z

Now 37 Mon 62 Tue 66 by Hannah James TOPICS: PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Nearly 50 employees of both the Big Lots and Party City Pensacola locations are scrambling to find new jobs ahead of the holidays. WEAR News spoke with one employee who says he was given virtually no notice. And now, he's left in limbo. Major retail companies Party City and Big Lots gave their employees less than 24 hours notice that their companies were going to be shutting down. That happened five days before Christmas. Party City is closing all of its stores after 40 years of operation. Nearly 20 employees at the Pensacola location were told Friday that it will be their last day of employment. Employees at Big Lots faced a similar text from their CEO. Notification also came Thursday. "Our CEO got in contact with us all, and e-mail," says Big Lots employee Brent Smith. "My boss also sent us all an e-mail. That's how we were notified." In September, Big Lots announced its plan to sell its assets to the private equity firm, Nexus Capital Management. Thursday, the same day, Smith received a notification. The company announced the sale is unlikely to go through. "There's not an official date on store closure," Smith says. "But we just started today on getting the signs and stuff out like that." Smith has been working full-time at this Big Lots for seven years now. He and the nearly 30 employees are left to plan for the future with Christmas on the horizon. "Yeah, it's a horrible time. It's like a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, kick in the butt," Smith says. "Yeah, no plans as of right now. Just looking around. Hopefully, we can find something here soon... My wife has been sick, so I've been trying to deal with that. So, it's been a crazy, crazy, year... A crazy couple of months." To the CEO of Big Lots, Smith shares the following message. "Good luck. Because we need the good luck as well," says Smith. "No hard feeling, but still kind of a kick in the butt for right around this time, because everybody is going to be hurting." Specifically for the Big Lots at Oak Village in Pensacola, they do not know the definitive closing date yet. Big Lots blamed several economic factors for its bankruptcy, including high inflation and interest rates, leading customers to change their purchasing behavior. Party City blames growing competition from online retailers, like Amazon and Walmart.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Sure That The Broad Demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Products Isn’t Going Anywhere

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI GPU darling whose products big tech can't get enough of. Yet, its GPUs, and particularly the latest Blackwell lineup, have also created doubts in investors' minds. Some quarters believe that as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are in high demand, tight supply, and pricey, big tech companies like Amazon will be forced to switch to either custom chips or products from Broadcom or Marvell. Cramer isn't buying any of this as he's sure that the broad demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products isn't going anywhere: "And I'm absolutely sure about that. Just the fact that Microsoft got their chips, immediately the wags, whoever the wags are said oh then there must be a demand problem if they got all their chips. That's completely untrue. I do not like, Carl, as you know, an up opening. The people who bought it yesterday at $127. It will be heat-seeking missiles blasting that $133. You need a crescendo sell-off and we did not. Haven't yet. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Party City to close all of its stores, report says

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Party City on Friday announced it will close all of its stores and has initiated corporate layoffs effective immediately, according to a CNN report. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to “commence a winddown process immediately,” and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. “That is without question the most difficult message that I’ve ever had to deliver,” Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company’s closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw “many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers,” according to a press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween’s continued rise within and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October that it would open 10 new “Spirit Christmas” stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City’s operation, even as the company began to offer items on Amazon in 2018. Representatives for Party City did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment on CNN’s report or potential story closures. Read the full CNN report here.

Title: The AI talent wars are just getting started
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24326135/ai-talent-wars-databricks-interview
Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:26:09Z

By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. For my last issue of the year, I’m focusing on the AI talent war, which is a theme I’ve been covering since this newsletter launched almost two years ago. And keep reading for the latest from inside Google and Meta this week. But first, I need your questions for a mailbag issue I’m planning for my first issue of 2025. You can submit questions via this form or leave them in the comments. This week, Databricks announced the largest known funding round for any private tech company in history. The AI enterprise firm is in the final stretch of raising $10 billion, almost all of which is going to go to buying back vested employee stock. How companies approach compensation is often undercovered in the tech industry, even though the strategies play a crucial role in determining which company gets ahead faster. Nowhere is this dynamic as intense as the war for AI talent, as I’ve covered before. To better understand what’s driving the state of play going into 2025, this week I spoke with Naveen Rao, VP of AI at Databricks. Rao is one of my favorite people to talk to about the AI industry. He’s deeply technical but also business-minded, having successfully sold multiple startups. His last company, MosaicML, sold to Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023. Now, he oversees the AI products for Databricks and is closely involved with its recruiting efforts for top talent. Our conversation below touches on the logic behind Databricks’s massive funding round, what specific AI talent remains scarce, why he thinks AGI is not imminent, and more. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: Why is this round mostly to help employees sell stock? Because $10 billion is a lot. You can do a lot with that. The company is a little over 11 years old. There have been employees that have been here for a long time. This is a way to get them liquidity. Most people don’t understand that this is not going into the balance sheet of Databricks. This is largely going to provide liquidity for past employees, [and] liquidity going forward for current and new employees. It ends up being neutral on dilution because they’re shares that already exist. They’ve been allocated to employees and this allows them to sell those to cover the tax associated with those shares. How much of the rapid increases in AI company valuations have to do with the talent war? It’s real. The key thing here is that it’s not just pure AI talent — people who come up with the next big thing, the next big paper. We are definitely trying to hire those people. There is an entire infrastructure of software and cloud that needs to be built to support those things. When you build a model and you want to scale it, that actually is not AI talent, per se. It’s infrastructure talent. The perceived bubble that we’re in around AI has created an environment where all of those talents are getting recruited heavily. We need to stay competitive. Who is being the most aggressive with setting market rates for AI talent? OpenAI is certainly there. Anthropic. Amazon. Google. Meta. xAI. Microsoft. We’re in constant competition with all of these companies. Would you put the number of researchers who can build a new frontier model under 1,000? Yeah. That’s why the talent war is so hot. The leverage that a researcher has in an organization is unprecedented. One researcher’s ideas can completely change the product. That’s kind of new. In semiconductors, people who came up with a new transistor architecture had that kind of leverage. That’s why these researchers are so sought after. Somebody who comes up with the next big idea and the next big unlock can have a massive influence on the ability of a company to win. Do you see that talent pool expanding in the near future or is it going to stay constrained? I see some aspects of the pool expanding. Being able to build the appropriate infrastructure and manage it, those roles are expanding. The top-tier researcher side is the hard part. It’s like looking for LeBron James. There are just not very many humans who are capable of that. I would say the Inflection-style acquisitions were largely driven by this kind of mentality. You have these concentrations of top-tier talent in these startups and it sounds ridiculous how much people pay. But it’s not ridiculous. I think that’s why you see Google hiring back Noam Shazeer. It’s very hard to find another Noam Shazeer. A guy we had at my previous company that I started, Nervana, is arguably the best GPU programmer in the world. He’s at OpenAI now. Every inference that happens on an OpenAI model is running through his code. You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, “Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.” “You start computing the downstream cost and it’s like, ‘Holy shit, this one guy saved us $4 billion.’” What’s the edge you have when you’re trying to hire a researcher to Databricks? You start to see some selection bias of different candidates. Some are AGI or bust, and that’s okay. It’s a great motivation for some of the smartest people out there. We think we’re going to get to AGI through building products. When people use technology, it gets better. That’s part of our pitch. AI is in a massive growth base but it’s also hit peak hype and is on the way down the Gartner hype curve. I think we’re on that downward slope right now, whereas Databricks has established a very strong business. That’s very attractive to some because I don’t think we’re so susceptible to the hype. Do the researchers you talk to really believe that AGI is right around the corner? Is there any consensus of when it’s coming? Honestly, there’s not a great consensus. I’ve been in this field for a very long time and I’ve been pretty vocal in saying that it’s not right around the corner. The large language model is a great piece of technology. It has massive amounts of economic uplift and efficiencies that can be gained by building great products around it. But it’s not the spirit of what we used to call AGI, which was human or even animal-like intelligence. These things are not creating magical intelligence. They’re able to slice up the space that we’re calling facts and patterns more easily. It’s not the same as building a causal learner. They don’t really understand how the world works. You may have seen Ilya Sutskever’s talk. We’re all kind of groping in the dark. Scaling was a big unlock. It was natural for a lot of people to feel enthusiastic about that. It turns out that we weren’t solving the right problem. Is the new idea that’s going to get to AGI the test-time compute or “reasoning” approach? No. I think it’s going to be an important thing for performance. We can improve the quality of answers, probably reduce the probability of hallucinations, and increase the probability of having responses that are grounded in fact. It’s definitely a positive for the field. But is it going to solve the fundamental problem of the spirit of AGI? I don’t believe so. I’m happy to be wrong, too. Do you agree with the sentiment that there’s a lot of room to build more good products with existing models, since they are so capable but still constrained by compute and access? Yeah. Meta started years later than OpenAI and Anthropic and they basically caught up, and xAI caught up extremely fast. I think it’s because the rate of improvement has essentially stopped. Nilay Patel compares the AI model race to early Bluetooth. Everyone keeps saying there’s a fancier Bluetooth but my phone still won’t connect. You see this with every product cycle. The first few versions of the iPhone were drastically better than the previous versions. Now, I can’t tell the difference between a three-year-old phone and a new phone. I think that’s what we see here. How we utilize these LLMs and the distribution that has been built into them to solve business problems is the next frontier.

CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees in a meeting viewed by CNN that Party City has to "commence a winddown process immediately," and that Friday would be their last day of work for the company. "That is without question the most difficult message that I've ever had to deliver," Litwin said at the meeting, according to the report. CNN reported the company's closure was due to ongoing financial challenges at the party supply retailer, which less than two years ago filed for bankruptcy protection over its inability to pay off $1.7 billion in debt. The New Jersey-based chain exited bankruptcy in September 2023 through a plan that included transitioning into a privately held company and canceling nearly $1 billion in debt. A majority of its 800 U.S. stores were able to stay open as it emerged from bankruptcy. Litwin was named CEO in August and said at the time he saw "many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers," according to a press release. Prior to his appointment, he was the CEO of Global Industrial Company, a distribution leader in industrial products. Competition in the party goods and costume space has grown in recent years, including Spirit Halloween's continued rise within and outside of the spooky season. The holiday costume chain announced in October that it would open 10 new "Spirit Christmas" stores, with some of the stores being converted from existing Spirit Halloween locations. Online retailers have also added pressure to Party City's operation, even as the company began to offer items on Amazon in 2018. Representatives for Party City did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on CNN's report or potential story closures. Read the full CNN report here. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: How Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lost its glow amid layoffs and pivots
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-layoffs-restructuring-pivots-struggling-celebrity-brand-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-20T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Gwyneth Paltrow took a measured tone earlier this year when she discussed Goop, her newsletter turned e-commerce company, onstage at a Forbes event. She didn't brag about the nine figures the brand had raised or its latest product release. Instead, she said she was proud Goop was still in business. "Some years we're down, then we're back up," she said. "I'm proud that we're still alive and kicking." That might seem surprising for a company that was valued at $433 million in 2020 and was a trailblazer for what a celebrity brand could be. But it's reflective of a company that — despite its name recognition and pop-culture footprint — has undergone several painful pivots in recent years. In September, Goop laid off nearly 20% of its staff, including its chief technology officer and its vice president of content. A few weeks later, it laid off about 6% of the remaining employees. Goop's recent cuts come as the company shifts focus to its beauty, fashion, and food businesses. It's the latest in a series of strategy changes over the past several years. Changes in focus are normal for a startup. Still, after 16 years of existence, the company isn't profitable and continues to struggle to build a firm foundation apart from Paltrow. The company's once buzzy supplement regimens generated $100,000 in sales on the day they launched in 2017. Now, only one of the four initial regimens is still offered online, and for a discount. A Goop spokesperson told Business Insider that any new supplements it launched would be part of its beauty business. Julia Hunter, a Goop board member and the former CEO of Jenni Kayne, addressed some of the company's struggles in an interview with Puck, published after BI sent Goop a series of questions for this story. "The company is doing very well from a revenue perspective, butoperating expenses have continued to grow," Hunter said. "I know that it's unpopular to let people go, but they hired a lot of people that they probably shouldn't have." On the content side, Goop has recently cut many editorial positions, including the vice president of content, the head beauty editor, and several other editors. A review of Goop's website shows few new articles, and its book imprint hasn't published a new release in over a year. The magazine ran two issues before folding, and while there were reports that Goop's Netflix series, "The Goop Lab," was renewed, it hasn't materialized. Paltrow's importance to the brand is evident in product launches, two former Goop employees told BI. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation; their identities are known to BI. When she's part of a launch campaign, Goop calls it an "A launch," and the performance of the advertising on social media "quadruples," one of the former employees said. Performance often drops off once she's no longer involved, this person added. Last month, a video featuring Paltrow that promoted Goop's newest release, a retinol serum, drew 1,100 likes on Instagram. The next day, a second post about the serum — which didn't include Paltrow — got fewer than 275 likes. "Brands need to find viable business models, rather than simply a celebrity face," Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital, said of A-list entrepreneurs. The celebrity brands that have grown to be the largest — like Kim Kardashian's Skims, Rihanna's Fenty, and Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty — have moved beyond their founder's image. Skims, which is valued at $4 billion, has made using models from popular culture a core part of its marketing strategy, for instance. Goop's founding story has become lore to a certain type of aspirant. In 2008, Paltrow was sitting in the kitchen of the London house she shared with her then-husband, Chris Martin, when she decided to write a newsletter for "family, friends, and friends of friends." The issue featured a recipe for banana muffins and photos shot on Paltrow's BlackBerry. "It was one of the first of its kind to leverage a curated lifestyle of a celebrity," Stacy Jones, the CEO of the branding agency Hollywood Branded, told BI. "It is aligned to her own personal brand in a very unique way that hadn't been done to that extent before." Before long, Paltrow was earning small checks from advertisers and began dreaming of a media empire. Paltrow hired media veterans from Meredith and Condé Nast to run the publication. There was a lifestyle website with travel guides and interviews on alternative medicine. Paltrow launched a publishing imprint, Goop Press, in 2015 and a magazine in partnership with Condé Nast in 2017. Conferences promised to be the next big thing for the brand when the In Goop Health Summit series kicked off in 2017, offering (mainly) women the promise of looking and feeling like Paltrow for the four-figure ticket price. In 2020, as streaming entered its golden age, she scored a deal with Netflix. But Goop suffered in recent years amid a broader digital media downturn. "Advertising business as a big part of revenue started to decline, and that was probably the biggest shift to revenue of the last several years," Hunter told Puck, adding that going forward, editorial would be "integrated with social media." Paltrow still posts regular episodes of the Goop podcast, and after a few years off because of the pandemic, the In Goop Health Summit returned last year. That said, Goop's media projects appear to have been largely shut down, as many of the staffers behind them were affected by the recent cuts. As Goop's media initiatives fell short, its e-commerce ambitions — or what the company dubbed "contextual commerce" — took center stage. The core of its e-commerce business has ebbed and flowed over the years. First, it pushed skincare, then fashion, then wellness. Now, it's back to beauty and fashion. "It's a lot of testing" of different verticals, the second former employee said. In May, Goop brought in outside consultants, led by Hunter, to help streamline the organization and reduce payroll. Then, in September, Goop announced its latest pivot, saying it would double down on fashion, beauty, and food. These aren't new initiatives for Goop, but the company has touted their recent growth. G. Label, the company's in-house clothing line, launched in 2016. The company told BI that the brand's sales were up 45% this year compared with the same period last year, but it declined to share the revenue numbers. The two former employees said they felt G. Label had historically underperformed partly because it was initially designed to fit Paltrow, who, at a slender 5-foot-9, has a much different figure from that of the average American woman. "We were just putting together whatever Gwyneth felt like wearing," the first former employee said. They added that the company revised the line in the past year using a new, standard-fit model, which they said had helped its sales. The Goop spokesperson said a new designer had been hired for G. Label in the past year and revamped the line. Goop's first foray into beauty was also in 2016. A few of the products have repeat customers — the neck peptide serum is a top seller — but there isn't a breakthrough hero product. Some recent efforts to expand the beauty offerings haven't taken off. Last year, the company launched Good Clean Goop, a moderately priced line, in Target and Amazon. Since then, the company has discounted a number of the brand's products, including the Daily Juice Cleanser and the Healthy Aging Serum. Puck reported in June that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target. The brand has not posted on social media in more than a month. The two former employees said Goop's contract with Target would end at the beginning of next year. Then there's Goop Kitchen, the "food" piece, which is not part of the core company. The Goop spokesperson said Goop Kitchen was set up as a joint venture and called it a "separate commercial entity." They declined to share what ownership stake Goop has, if any. Goop has publicly touted growth statistics — like a 25% sales increase for Goop Beauty and a 45% increase for G. Label. The former employees said these figures were driven in part by an influx of paid ad spend. The Goop spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company is profitable. Hunter told Puck it wasn't. Whether Goop's latest efforts to boost revenue and cut back on staff are enough to turn the company around remains to be seen. Paltrow, for her part, has hinted that she wants Goop to thrive without her. "I don't think I can have this job forever," she told The New York Times last year. "I think it would be nice to return my investors' money, and I really want to do that. That's important to me." Jump to

Title: Lawsuit Accuses Amazon Online Health Clinic of ‘Reckless and Negligent’ Care After 45-Year-Old Man Dies

According to Philip Tong’s family, Amazon’s One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent.” Tong died in an emergency room hours after a One Medical telehealth provider advised him to buy an inhaler to treat symptoms including shortness of breath and coughing up blood. Share Options A California family sued Amazon-owned telehealth provider One Medical and a local hospital and physician, alleging they were “reckless and negligent” in their care of a 45-year-old man who died after seeking help via an online appointment. According to the complaint, 45-year-old Philip Tong scheduled an online appointment with Amazon One Medical on Dec. 18, 2023. Tong complained of shortness of breath and said he was coughing up blood and that his feet had turned blue. One Medical advised him to purchase an inhaler. Hours later, Tong visited the emergency room at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, where he collapsed and died. Tong’s wife, Suzanne, and his two daughters filed suit Oct. 1 in Alameda County Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Amazon One Medical, Alta Bates Summit and Dr. Aurelia A. Cheng of medical malpractice and wrongful death. The plaintiffs allege One Medical lacked “adequately trained and qualified staff” and was “careless, reckless and negligent” in its treatment of Tong, by “failing to appropriately undertake to care for or recommend care, order testing and providing proper treatment for the plaintiff.” At the time of his appointment, Tong had been sick with flu-like symptoms for about a week and was suffering from “uncontrolled diabetes, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, infection and sepsis,” according to the lawsuit. The case remained under the media’s radar until The Washington Post reported the story Wednesday. According to the Post, this “appears to be the first wrongful-death suit to be brought against One Medical, which Amazon acquired in February 2023.” The Post cited Suzanne’s remarks from her husband’s Dec. 28, 2023, funeral: “No one expected a 45-year-old man who had the flu to suddenly be dead … And to have him taken so quickly, so unexpectedly — there are no words.” The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages to be determined at trial. A hearing in the case is scheduled for March 2025. Your support helps fund this work, and CHD’s related advocacy, education and scientific research. Donate Now Training of telehealth providers ‘in its infancy’ In a statement cited by the Post, Amazon One Medical spokesperson Samantha Kruse said the company is “prohibited by law from discussing patient records.” “We care deeply about every patient we serve, and the quality and safety of our care are our highest priorities,” Kruse said. “We’re proud of our extensive quality and safety measures, and of the health outcomes we help our patients achieve. We take concerns about our care extremely seriously, and we’re committed to continuous improvement.” Legal experts told The Defender the case will come down to what the evidence will demonstrate about causation. “The timing and delay will be a factual issue and will impact causation and harm,” California-based healthcare attorney Rick Jaffe told The Defender. “The medical records, including the recording of the intake call, could sink or save both facilities.” Jaffe added: “Once a patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath and recent splitting-up blood, and a diagnosis of sepsis, there’s no role for online medical care other than to say to go immediately to the ER, which is what the patient did apparently.” Pediatrician Dr. Michelle Perro told The Defender that while telehealth provides certain benefits to patients, it can’t replace physical examinations in cases like Tong’s. She said: “While clearly telehealth has many advantages in terms of increasing patient access to care, a foundational tenet of the practice of medicine is doing a thorough physical exam … Although practitioners may not be trained in telehealth, any provider should be able to realize the gravity of Mr. Tong’s reported symptoms. “Upon reviewing the health history of Mr. Tong and establishing the seriousness of his complaints, there should have been an immediate prompt to have him come in for an in-person assessment directly to an urgent care or emergency setting.” Noting the increased prevalence of telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense, told The Defender, “The ‘pandemic’ continues to degrade our quality of life.” Flores said he doesn’t oppose telehealth for routine issues. In California, physicians are still held to the same standard of care, he said. “But, in instances when, as alleged in the complaint, the deceased was simply told to take an inhaler even though he was coughing up blood, was short of breath and had blue feet, this practice of medicine becomes a travesty.” Jaffe, who suggested that telehealth is “all about triage and screening,” said there “have to be systems in place where even the telephone operators have to be trained to make quick and accurate screening of patients and moving them to an ER or urgent care center.” He said the discovery process for the lawsuit should focus on that training and those systems. “The recorded call will be very important, and perhaps the critical piece of evidence,” he said. Simon Rowland, a researcher with consumer health company Haleon and expert in telehealth and malpractice, told the Post that few telehealth providers receive special training in issuing remote diagnoses to patients. “Training in that area is in its infancy,” Rowland said. “It’s a clinical scenario that people need to understand better in terms of the risks and benefits.” For Patrick M. Wood, author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse Of Global Transformation,” telehealth’s reliance on standardized protocols will hurt patient care. “Standardized protocols and ‘best practices’ will always marginalize human judgment in those cases that fall outside their scope, often with devastating consequences,” Wood told The Defender. ‘Profit motive can lead to grave errors’ According to the Post, Amazon has pushed to expand its presence in telehealth since it finalized its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in 2023. This includes efforts to combine One Medical’s services with those offered by its own telehealth service, previously known as Amazon Clinic, the Daily Mail reported. Amazon also operates an online pharmacy, Amazon Pharmacy, which arose out of its acquisition of PillPack in 2018 for $750 million, according to the Daily Mail. At a recent Amazon media event, One Medical CEO Trent Green said the company plans to increase online primary care services, including making telehealth appointments available on nights, weekends and holidays, the Post reported. “By building, testing, and scaling new models of care delivery we can help reduce costs, improve outcomes, and fundamentally transform health care,” Green said. According to the Daily Mail, One Medical has more than 800,000 members and operates over 200 medical offices in more than 20 markets. Amazon’s foray into healthcare previously encountered obstacles. According to the Daily Mail, Haven — a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — aimed at lowering employee healthcare costs, was discontinued in 2021.

According to the Post, “As One Medical has grown under Amazon’s ownership, it has sometimes struggled to adequately care for its more vulnerable patients.” In February, Amazon One Medical announced layoffs, including of some of its clinical staff, and moved more of its patient care and communication online. The layoffs included clinical reception staff who were replaced by an Arizona-based call center. According to the Post, One Medical employees said this “put patients at risk.” In June, leaked documents revealed that Amazon One Medical staff repeatedly mishandled urgent calls from patients experiencing life-threatening symptoms. The Post reported that current and former employees have alleged “pressure to improve productivity” increased after Amazon’s purchase of One Medicine. “Virtual providers’ schedules were so tightly packed, one former employee said, that two different patients reported having telehealth visits with health-care providers who were clearly calling from their cars,” the Post reported. Jaffe said he expects “more of these cases to be filed against online companies as the telehealth model expands and more players come into the market.” Perro voiced concerns about the encroachment of non-medical organizations into healthcare. “The constant push for medical providers to see more patients and quickly make assessments driven by the profit motive can lead to grave errors.” Wood suggested that “so-called ‘evidence-based medicine’ paved the way for the technocratic takeover” of healthcare starting in the 1990s, forcing out human-based medicine. “Bad outcomes like this case are a marker of evidence-based medicine, which empowers technocrats to overuse technology at the expense of common sense.” Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D., based in Athens, Greece, is a senior reporter for The Defender and part of the rotation of hosts for CHD.TV's "Good Morning CHD."

Title: Good Morning, News: Georgia Prosecutor Kicked Off Trump Case, and Good News for Portland / Bad News for Murder Hornets

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! GOOD MORNING, PORTLAND! 👋 Expect a cloudy, but much drier (and warmer!) day today with a steamy high of 55 degrees—aaaaaand, while we're on the subject of "steamy," don't forget to take the Mercury's SEX SURVEY! It's anonymous, so you can answer all our very probing questions with complete honesty, and in January you can read all the steamy results in our upcoming "LOVE/SEX" print issue! But in the meantime? Here's some steamy NEWS. IN LOCAL NEWS: • Controversial oil transport and storage company, Zenith Energy—you know, the one that could cause a Portland environmental catastrophe that could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster—was previously given the green light by the city to continue their clearly dangerous operations. But now? The DEQ has slammed the brakes on that process and is requiring the company to get a new air quality permit to remain in compliance with local agencies. This could afford the new, incoming city council and mayor time to put in place a new, stricter plan for Zenith—but will they? Our Taylor Griggs has the story. • Portland State University is currently struggling with what they say is a $18 million budget deficit, which is why they say they made the decision to lay off 17 non-tenure track faculty members. And while this is far less severe than their previous plan to lay off 94 workers, PSU's professors union is pointing to a financial report from an outside expert that reportedly shows that the university is in much better financial shape than they're letting on. Kevin Foster digs into the details in this interesting report. With an $18 million budget gap, Portland State University is cutting 17 academic staffers. That's less than what was anticipated in October, but PSU's professors union says an independent financial review shows stable reserves, and no need for layoffs. PSU says it's bound by accounting guidelines.⁠[image or embed] • Good news: Multnomah County's successful plan to help homeless Black people by sheltering them in a Portland motel just got a little better. The county has leased an even bigger motel—one with 65 rooms, and with a 10-year lease—in North Portland to house people of color, which will be run by the Urban League of Portland. For those naysayers who love to bitch and moan about the county at every possibility, you may want to take note of this stat: "In a one-year period from July 2023 to 2024, 55% of people exiting the shelter moved into permanent housing. Others moved into drug addiction treatment, behavioral health services or other medical programs. Only 3% returned to the street, officials said." That's progress, buddy. • More good news: The Community Cycling Center—the long running nonprofit that fixes and resells bikes to the community for cheap as well as offering bike education for kids—has found the funding it needs to stay afloat after being in danger of shutting down. When the center said it needed $349,000 to continue operating, the community was like, "We'll do you one better," and raised a whopping $389,000—$40 grand more—which will keep the good work flowing for the foreseeable future.

The hornets, which are very large and are known for killing 42 people and seriously injuring 1,625 in China in 2013, had slowly been making their way across the US border—but were stopped thanks to the diligence of science and neighbors who put traps in their yards. That said, researchers are remaining vigilant to ensure the little stinging fuckers don't return. Looking for the perfect vinyl gifts for those music lovers and collectors in your life?

Musk tweeted over 100 times in a day in his attempt to sway congress (and their voters back home) to kill the deal, often spreading the type of bullshit misinformation that he and his fellow conspiracy theorists are so good at. Elon Musk’s congressional meddling had many Democrats referring to him as “President Musk” Wednesday—a jab sure to get under the notoriously spotlight-obsessed president-elect’s skin.[image or embed] • In another courtroom win for Trump, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis has been disqualified from the ex-and-future president's criminal racketeering case—which could stymie the state's chances for prosecution. Willis had been accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an attorney that was hired to lead the election interference case against Trump, and while one judge had initially allowed her to continue, that decision has been overturned. The only good news? Trump's indictment trial will continue despite the defense's best efforts to have the charges dismissed. • Union members at seven Amazon distribution centers across the US have walked off the job, after claiming that the company has refused to recognize their union and enter into bargaining. While the walkout is happening during the busy Christmas delivery season, Amazon officials contend deliveries will stay on time—though may be slowed a bit in major cities. • Luigi Mangione, the suspect/internet hero indicted in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is waiving extradition and will be traveling to New York City from Philadelphia where he will face murder and terrorism charges.

Title: Reality TV Producers Urge Buyers To Be Braver & Bolder With Bigger Budgets In 2025

By Peter White Executive Editor, Television It’s been a weird year for the unscripted television business. Networks and streamers have been greenlighting fewer shows and producers are struggling, with numerous mid-size companies closing and layoffs across the sector and global outsourcing and budget issues becoming major talking points with the reality industry. Travis Kelce became a game show host, Alec Baldwin started filming a TLC reality series and Colin Jost is hosting a Jeopardy! spinoff. Blake Shelton and Taylor Sheridan have a new singing competition at CBS, which also is developing a new cooking show with Padma Lakshmi. Hulu breathed new life into reality with Mormon wives, Netflix is going full Willy Wonka, American Gladiators is returning, shows like The Traitors and The Floor are being renewed at quite the clip, and Meghan Markle still is getting attention at Netflix. Watch on Deadline RELATED: Renewed TV Series 2024: A Photo Gallery There were some interesting business models being explored including NBC’s international push with Destination X, Fox taking second windows for Amazon game shows and The CW making low-cost board game adaptations. But there were plenty of shows coming to an end including a swath of Nat Geo titles including Wicked Tuna, Hulu’s The D’Amelio Show and ABC’s Lucky 13. Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules is looking for an entirely new cast. RELATED: 2024 TV Series Cancellations & Renewals There were also a lot of layoffs affecting unscripted execs at Netflix, Lionsgate, The CW, Lifetime, A&E, ABC and Amazon as well as high-profile departures at American Idol and America’s Got Talent, the exit of CBS’ Jack Sussman and the retirement of Warner Bros. Discovery’s Kathleen Finch. On a more positive note, Jeff Gaspin took over reality programming at Netflix. On a corporate level, Amazon looked to sell its unscripted production companies, Fulwell 73 is merging with Lebron James’ Springhill, All3Media completed its takeover by RedBird IMI but closed Maverick TV USA, Asylum Entertainment started investing in companies like Done+Dusted after receiving cash from Endeavor, Wheelhouse scored money from Jeff Bewkes and Kevin Tsujihara and Chick-Fil-A started a streaming service with reality ambitions. RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs So Far In 2024: From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN All well and good, but what’s next year going to look like? Deadline spoke with to close to 50 unscripted producers about their hopes and dreams for 2025. INVESTMENT IN LIVE PROGRAMMING More live event programming. This year we saw so many watercooler moments with The Roast of Tom Brady, Dancing with the Stars going viral with the TikTok generation and the Tyson-Paul fight. That nostalgic feeling of bringing everyone together for a shared cultural experience is important no matter what format or platform people are watching.Rob Mills, EVP Unscripted and Alternative Entertainment, Walt Disney Television (Hulu’s It’s All Country) RELATED: 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming It’s clear platforms and networks know the value of live programming, but we’d love to see more investment in live content across genres, outside the worlds of sports and comedy. We’ve seen how great live shows can revive event programming, and more innovation in this space from producers and more backing from buyers could be a boon for unscripted.Lucilla D’Agostino, Head, Big Fish Entertainment & Evolution Media (Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules) INTRODUCE UNSCRIPTED TAX INCENTIVES IN CALIFORNIA We hope to see a renewed focus on innovation within the unscripted television industry in 2025, driven by three key changes. First, adopting fresh approaches to bring more original commissions to life, especially bold new American formats that push the boundaries. Second, meaningful subsidies in New York and Los Angeles — the two most important production hubs in the U.S. — are essential to ensuring the longevity of these cities, which are losing productions to cost-cutting pressures. Finally, a stronger commitment to sharing upside will inspire top talent across all disciplines of production to give their best, knowing their efforts are meaningfully rewarded in success.Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman, Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Television – Nonfiction (ABC’s Shark Tank) I think we are all eagerly hoping for a substantial California Film and Television Tax Credit to be approved in 2025. The unscripted industry could greatly benefit from a portion of that funding to incentivize companies to shoot in L.A. We have an abundance of exceptional above- and below-the-line talent right here, but many are being forced to leave their homes and families for extended periods to earn a living in other states or countries. Let’s keep our industry thriving locally. Come on, Gavin — make it happen! And … ad-funded content has enormous untapped potential to address some of the industry’s toughest challenges for both producers and networks. While there seems to be a growing appetite for it, there hasn’t been much to show for it yet. There are more conversations happening in this space than ever, and I’m hopeful we’ll see more of it come to fruition in 2025. Fewer episodes per season have also become a real challenge — especially for shows with tighter budgets — and small episode orders make it hard for production companies to stay profitable and limit opportunities to tell great stories. Larger episode orders would not only stabilize businesses but also unlock better economies of scale. More episodes equals better stories plus healthier businesses. DEI feels like it’s slipping away, but letting it die is bad business. We’ve got a deep pool of talent, behind the camera and on-screen, that deserves a fair shot. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion isn’t just about doing good; it’s good for the bottom line. Don’t pull the plug in 2025.Jennifer O’Connell and Rebecca Quinn, Co-CEOs, Velvet Hammer Media (The CW’s The Big Bakeover) If Gavin Newsom were to give tax incentives to at least unscripted union series, it would be a significant step toward bringing production back to Hollywood. Without such incentives, achieving a lower price point for these shows becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible.Jenny Daly, President, Critical Content (Netflix’s Sly) We strongly encourage tax incentives for filming unscripted content in Los Angeles. These shows are only as good as the individuals who produce them, and while B17 has tapped into an incredibly talented Canadian community of late, we would also love to utilize the brilliant minds here in L.A. who have contributed to our success over the past decade but currently face limited opportunities.Rhett Bachner and Brien Meagher, Founders, B17 Entertainment (Netflix’s History of Swear Words) TAKE BIGGER RISKS, BUY BOLDER IDEAS It would be wonderful if buyers were more willing to invest in unscripted ideas that have never been done before. At ESNA, we’re fortunate to have access to a wealth of fabulous IP across Banijay, and we thrive on innovating and reimagining concepts to find the “why now.” But when we look at the most daring scripted hits, they are almost always true original ideas. As we move into 2025, my hope for unscripted content is that when a truly great idea excites a buyer, they get to place a bet on it and make something that has never been done before.Sharon Levy, CEO, Endemol Shine North America (Fox’s MasterChef) In 2025, we’d like to see the unscripted community champion more bold and original concepts. While spinoffs and reboots have a valuable place, we’d like to experience a renewed focus on fresh ideas driven by creative risk-taking. By aiming to deliver content that feels genuinely new and exciting, we can meaningfully push the unscripted space forward for audiences and our creative partners. Bridgette Theriault and Dan Sacks, SVP Development Warner Horizon/Telepictures (ABC’s The Bachelor) We are optimistic about 2025 because there seems to be a real appetite in the global market for big ideas and a growing willingness to partner and collaborate on creating and launching them. We are excited about the new opportunities ahead with the new business models emerging.Allison Wallach, Head of Unscripted Entertainment, Fox Entertainment Studios (Fox’s The Masked Singer) I’m optimistic that 2025 will be the year of risk: buyers taking risks to commission the big, loud ideas they say they want; producers leaving their comfort zones to pull them off; and the industry at large taking a risk on figuring out a way to utilize the incredible talent pool in our country.Karrie Wolfe, Co-Head of Development, North Road’s Kinetic Content (Netflix’s Love Is Blind) The recognition that all our creative futures thrive with a little bit of risk. Great content and breakout formats don’t always get born from deep within a corporate machine that houses 130 labels with footprints in 26 countries. Some of the world’s greatest unscripted formats were created with a spark by a wipe board, pitched with an in-person run-through and then sold to executives and commissioners that were given the freedom and motivation themselves to take the occasional risk. Robin Ashbrook, Founder, theoldschool (Netflix’s Next in Fashion) The single best thing that could happen would be a huge hit show that was sold off paper, without tape, existing IP or big star names and unaltered by data or focus groups. A show that a network just flat-out believed in and took a punt on. Taking risks has never been harder, but it’s the only way to create something special. To get the industry’s courage back, we all need someone to trust their instincts on a totally fresh idea and, critically, turn out to be absolutely right.Glenn Hugill, Chief Content Officer, Wheelhouse (Netflix’s Buying Beverly Hills) I’d love to see the unscripted TV community take braver risks in 2025. Reviving classics will always have its place, but the real future is in creating fresh ideas that connect with audiences now and could become the iconic formats of tomorrow. At Eureka, we’re focused on pushing boundaries with new concepts, and if we all lean into more creativity and bold thinking, 2025 could be truly transformational for the industry.Chris Culvenor, Co-CEO, Eureka Productions (Netflix’s The Mole) For 2025’s unscripted genie, I have three wishes. Firstly, for networks, cablers and streamers to re-allocate budget for unscripted. Secondly, a commitment to developing brand-new and original competition, dating and social experiment formats; we need to keep unscripted audiences engaged. Finally, more! More budget, more commissions, more work for talented unscripted execs, creators, producers, crew and post staff.Julie Pizzi, CEO, Bunim/Murray Productions (MTV’s The Challenge) The unscripted industry was born from creative mavericks who challenged conventions and redefined what television could be. In 2025, I’d like to see us all lean further into that legacy — embracing bold, untested ideas and reigniting the magic that sparked this industry.Matt Sharp, CEO, Sharp Entertainment (TLC’s 90 Day Fiancé) I’d love to lose the word “unscripted” completely and tighten the community here in L.A. In many ways, producers who have been labeled as “unscripted” get the worst of all worlds, quickly relegated to either what’s considered perishable reality volume or precious documentary with a message. But the truth is we are creators, writers, directors, DPs, editors and the nimble problem solvers who work with every storytelling tool imaginable. What I mean is, we are the adaptable ones, the survival of the fittest. We are the ones who can do a lot with a little and we are the ones who should be leading the charge into the great unknown regardless of genre, bucket or past (habitual) Hollywood stigma. We will roll up our sleeves and get it done, so let’s embrace that and redraw the boundaries where creatives can retake control by doing and risk taking. Isn’t that how this business was built?Ari Mark, Co-Founder, Ample Entertainment (Netflix’s This is The Zodiac Speaking) Everyone knows the past few years have been challenging for everyone in the unscripted business — on both sides of the buyer/seller line. My greatest wish for 2025 is for decision-makers to take more strategic chances on new content. Embrace original ideas from creative thinkers who understand how to deliver a big content bang for smart bucks. We all understand that pre-existing IP can be a good choice, and it often works, but the biggest breakthroughs that boosted the bottom line for brands across the past decade have been fresh, risky, exciting new swings. Even in times of significant uncertainty, intelligent risks can be transformative.Gena McCarthy, Unconventional Entertainment (Hallmark+’s Celebrations with Lacey Chabert) One thing I hope will change in 2025 is the downward pressure on budgets, especially as viewership and cultural significance of unscripted projects are at an all-time high on many platforms.Ross Dinerstein, CEO, Campfire Studios (Netflix’s The Menendez Brothers) The game and competition format has been one of the strongest genres ever since it helped launch television in its infancy. Recently, we’ve seen our industry embrace this time-tested formula on both broadcast and streaming platforms. We’re excited for this genre to be revitalized. Gabriel Marano, Head of Television, Hasbro Entertainment (The CW’s Scrabble) Next year I’d love to see unscripted television fully embrace interactive content, such as choose-your-own-adventure formats and augmented reality experiences. These innovations would empower audiences to engage with shows in exciting new ways, creating a more immersive and personal connection. Additionally, I hope to see the continued expansion of successful franchise formats globally, as they provide a unique opportunity to bring diverse stories and perspectives to screens worldwide.Lashan Browning, Founder and CEO, Antoinette Media (MTV’s Love & Hip Hop) In 2025, I’d love to see the unscripted television community fully embrace bold storytelling, artistry and revelatory work that challenges long-held narratives. By championing untold stories from underrepresented voices and speaking truth to power, we have an unparalleled opportunity to engage audiences, spark essential conversations and inspire cultural change. Our industry thrives when we take creative risks, and I hope 2025 is the year we lean into this potential more than ever.Mary Robertson, Maxine Productions (ID’s Quiet On Set) I would like to see more buyers trusting their instincts to greenlight series and renewals. Instead, decisions rest in the hands of giant committees spanning a dozen departments and focus groups largely comprised of people paid $50 for the day to determine the fate of our industry. Leaders like Nancy Dubuc and Eileen O’Neill considered all of that but ultimately relied on their own instincts. They championed series that became hits by stepping outside the safety net of “research.” I miss those days because many hits were born from that decision-making process. The industry is filled with talented high-level executives – let’s empower them to say yes instead of scaring them into saying no.Steve Michaels, CEO, Asylum Entertainment Group (Discovery+’s Hillsong) With networks and platforms prioritizing those “undeniable’ shows” – the slam-dunks – it would be great to see more space for three-pointers: big, fun ideas that might be a bit riskier and more surprising but also offer more upside.Steven Weinstock and Glenda Hersh, Co-CEOs, Truly Original (Bravo’s Summer House) We’d like to see the industry take bigger risks (again) and embrace bolder, more original creative. We want to surprise audiences when they show up, regardless of platform. Fearlessness in finding and lighting up universes and talent defined unscripted for a long time and getting back to that would be a win for the business in every way.Matt Ostrom, Co-Founder, Magilla Entertainment (Discovery’s Moonshiners) The healthiest thing about the unscripted business right now is its embrace of big stories. Making sure that we all also look out for the smaller, lesser-known stories that can have just as big an impact on audiences will keep all of our work fresh, exciting and, best of all, unexpected.Aaron Cohen, Chief Creative Officer, Words + Pictures (HBO’s Murder in Boston) In our current market, some buyers have been more reliant on existing formats and older established IP. While we do benefit from some of this ourselves and understand its value and importance, I would love to see more of a willingness from networks/streamers to make more room for new riskier concepts, as it’s the only way to launch and discover new hits. Sandy Varo Jarrell, CEO, Bright Spot Content (Discovery’s Puppy Bowl) As storytellers, we’ll always bet on ourselves. But at some point, you just can’t do more with less money. Perhaps it’s time for networks to reimagine the traditional commission structure and embrace working with producers and talent to invent unique ways to fund and create content. And let’s take some risks! What we have been doing is not working, so why not be bold and try a new approach? Our greatest successes this year have been when our partners let us take some rights, shared revenue streams and allowed us to be more creatively nimble. Patrick Weiland, President, Intuitive Content (PBS’ Hope in the Water) We hope that in 2025, there is an even bigger and broader appetite across all networks and streamers for unscripted content, because nothing compares to compelling and authentic storytelling through real-life experiences.Eric and Shannon Evangelista, Co-Founders, Hot Snakes Media (ID’s The Curious Case of Natalia Grace) I’d like to see the business shift away from inflated development requests and instead put more trust in proven producers to deliver on great creative ideas. A more direct and efficient approach to proving a concept, on both sides — producer and buyer — could yield such tremendous results for the production community and bring about more opportunities for partnerships to flourish.Jessica Sebastian-Dayeh, President, Maven (Roku’s The Marriage Pact) Return to creativity. I would urge buyers to trust their most creative executives and lean away from relying so heavily on research during the greenlight process. Data and research provide insights into the past, they cannot predict the future. A talented producer with a creative mind will find your next big hit. Fourteen years ago, when I sold Dance Moms — a franchise soon to reach 300 episodes and counting — it wasn’t on anyone’s needs list. No one was looking for that kind of show. It took a network executive with gut instinct and a willingness to take a risk to roll the dice. Today, many of the most talked-about series come from abroad, where risk-taking and creativity are more prominent. We have some of the most talented producers in the history of unscripted television walking among us. There’s never been a better time to let them shine.Jeff Collins, Resilient Content In 2025, I’d like to see less fear in the marketplace and a return to buyers taking bold risks instead of betting solely on sure things. Many of the beloved franchises we enjoy today were born from networks taking unexpected swings, and our industry needs to embrace that spirit again to foster innovation and create a new generation of hit shows. This also means giving shows the time and space to grow — believing in the potential of talent or ideas to develop over time. We need to move away from the mindset that a show’s success is determined by its first outing. In today’s world of fragmented audiences, building loyalty and viewership over time is more critical than ever.Nick Rigg, Brass Monkeys Media PARTNERSHIPS, RIGHTS & COMMUNITY I like to think of the unscripted industry as a team sport. There are a lot of players who have key roles in creating a show, all with the same goal. In 2025, I’d like to see the industry and all its players working together and winning together as a community. By breaking the mold and finding new and creative ways to collaborate, we’ll not only survive until ’25, we’ll thrive.Toby Gorman, President, Universal Television Alternative Studio (NBC’s That’s My Jam) The recent shift in the market I believe has brought many in the unscripted community closer together than ever. Both network buyers and producers are feeling the effects, which I hope sparks a deeper sense of partnership and solidarity between both sides on every collaboration.Jimmy Fox, EVP Unscripted Development and Sales, Fremantle (ABC’s American Idol) I think what we all want is to see everyone back to work. Any innovative business models, partnerships or incentives that help keep productions Stateside would bring a significant lift to the industry.Adam Sher, President, ITV America (Peacock’s Love Island) This is not the first time co-productions have been on the table for networks in the U.S. – quite the contrary. Once upon a time, each U.S. linear network had dedicated executives with the word “co-production” in their title. They would go out to market and find a distributor willing to come in to help close financing. I don’t know how much of that is happening, but the producers need the networks to be more willing to open this back up in a real way. For their own survival, U.S. linear networks should build relationships with networks internationally to be able to make quick calls to trust partners and say, “Hey, do you want it? We love this but need $50,000 an ep to close financing.” I know that U.S. network-to-international network conversations are happening on a very small level, but they need to expand those conversations. The networks are relying on the producers and distributors to go out and find the money, but all options need to be on the table in the market — all hands on deck. JC Mills, President and Head of Content, Cineflix (History’s American Pickers) We as nonfiction professionals have always been a resourceful and resilient group, and I’m hoping 2025 is when we can put that mindset even more into action. I think the sooner we accept that the market is the market, the sooner we can see the opportunities that exist for us to thrive in this new landscape. The opportunities may not be in the places we’ve experienced them in the past, but there are opportunities in new places, genres and strategies that can position our industry for continued success. In the early 2000s, unscripted was thought of by many in the scripted world as cheap, filler programming. We turned that around then, and we can do that again as we work with our distribution partners to build a new nonfiction marketplace. But it’s up to us to open our creative aperture and find those new genres and platforms to keep our audiences engaged in nonfiction storytelling.Jeff Hasler, President, Original Productions (Discovery’s Deadliest Catch) More buyers who recognize the extraordinary opportunity and value offered by nonfiction programming. Drive the culture. Be a part of the conversation. Win big awards. Make your subscribers even happier. Nonfiction offers it all.R.J. Cutler, Founder, This Machine (Netflix’s Martha) The heart of unscripted will always be the people. In 2025, I would love to come back to that guiding light and see all of us in the community, networks and producers taking more chances to let the casts and stories develop organically. Our industry will thrive as long as we continue to support these bold personalities who we all love.Carlos King, CEO, Kingdom Reign Entertainment (OWN’s Belle Collective) 2024 was truly a rough year for our industry, both scripted and unscripted. There were fewer pickups, more layoffs, tight budgets, high expectations and a general sense of dread that consumed what had been a thriving community of entertainment creatives. As we look toward 2025, we should do so with hope, as well as a realistic sense of expectations. My dream for 2025 is to lock arms with our network partners to create fresh, innovative content that will reinvigorate their audience’s decades-long passion for unscripted storytelling.Rob Eric, Chief Content Officer, Scout Productions (Netflix’s Queer Eye) Treat production companies as partners, not vendors, and the relationship will thrive. The industry has been weighed down by hesitation and fear, with too much posturing born from anxiety. It’s time to take bold risks and move faster. That’s what will inject new life into the business. Accelerate renewals, reduce development limbo and stand out in a crowded marketplace. Let’s prioritize real action and restore a higher standard of professionalism and ethical business practices. The industry cannot move forward by standing still. It’s time to take decisive steps and create real momentum.David Brady, CEO, Cream Productions (Netflix’s Age of Samurai) We’d love to see the industry embrace a more fluid rights universe and have more open and serious conversations about substantial U.S. licensing deals that allow producers to pursue international and other future sales. This could be an incredibly effective solution to the challenges that both buyers and sellers are facing, and while we’ve already begun to see the pendulum swing in this direction, it would be great to see those discussions and deals become more widespread in 2025.Greg Henry and Kim Woodard, Co-Presidents, Lucky 8 (Netflix’s Unlocked) Let’s have some fun in 2025 and appreciate how fortunate are we to get paid to entertain folks. So let’s stop obsessing about staying alive to ‘25 and focus instead on the creative opportunities that change generates. Because we at Plimsoll love TV, we categorically refuse to spend the next 12 months feeling downcast about the state of the industry.

The New York Times: Trump, Egged On By Musk, Condemns Spending Deal, Raising Fears Of Government Shutdown A bipartisan spending deal to avert a shutdown was on life support on Wednesday after President-elect Donald J. Trump condemned it, leaving lawmakers without a strategy to fund the government past a Friday night deadline. Mr. Trump issued a scathing statement ordering Republicans not to support the sprawling bill, piling on to a barrage of criticism from Elon Musk, who spent Wednesday trashing the measure on social media and threatening any Republican who supported it with political ruin.

The back-up option Johnson is examining is a “clean” continuing resolution, two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill. That would entail dropping the additional provisions that were included in the initial 1,500-page spending package negotiated by congressional leaders, including disaster aid and economic assistance for farmers. (Schnell, 12/18) The New York Times: What’s Inside The Spending Bill To Avoid A Government Shutdown? The stopgap spending bill congressional leaders agreed on this week began as a simple funding measure to keep government funds flowing past a Friday night deadline and into early next year, long after House Republicans elect a speaker and President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in. But by the time it was rolled out to lawmakers on Tuesday night, it had transformed into a true Christmas tree of a bill, adorned with all manner of unrelated policy measures in the kind of year-end catchall that Republicans have long derided. It is a 1,547-page behemoth of a package with provisions including foreign investment restrictions, new health care policies and a stadium site for the Washington Commanders.

Though several Senate Democrats protested Johnson’s 11th-hour maneuver, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was approved 85-14 — a comfortable margin that belied the depth of frustration among lawmakers who said the legislation, as written, discriminates against thousands of military families and their right to health care. The bill heads next to the president, who is expected to sign it into law. Several senior Democratic senators said that while they shared their colleagues’ frustration with the transgender-care provision, the NDAA was too important to fail.

Title: Amazon delays return to office for thousands of workers due to lack of space

Seattle – Amazon.com will not have enough space for thousands of employees when they start returning to the office five days a week in January. The company recently told some staff working in at least seven cities – including Austin, Dallas and Phoenix – that their return dates will be pushed back as much as four months, according to people familiar with the situation. The delay is the latest twist in a return-to-office (RTO) saga that has roiled Amazon’s normally heads-down workforce. Some employees say they are unhappy about being asked to come in full-time when many of their tech industry peers have more flexible work arrangements. Amazon employs more than 350,000 corporate employees worldwide – mostly in the US – and it is not clear precisely how many people are affected by the RTO delays. A company spokesperson said the vast majority of employees will have desks starting on Jan 2. Employees in Dallas were recently told there would not be sufficient space for them all to work five days a week in the office until March or April, one of the sources said. Some workers in the company’s Midtown Manhattan office in the Lord & Taylor building might not have space for full-time work until May, another source said. Amazon also notified employees in Atlanta, Nashville and Houston that it did not have sufficient space for them all to return in January, Business Insider reported on Dec 16. When chief executive Andy Jassy announced the aggressive return-to-work mandate in September, he and other executives said it was necessary to nurture an eroding company culture. But some employees suspect the mandate is an effort to thin the ranks and avoid layoffs and severance payments. Amazon denies this. Employees say they have proved in recent years that teams can be effective while working remotely. Some of those affected by the RTO delay reacted with relief – evidence that the five-day office mandate is widely unpopular. For more than a year, most Amazon employees have been asked to badge in three days a week, though there are exceptions for teams and fully remote positions. Amazon did not have enough seats ready for that initial RTO plan, including in Bellevue, Washington, where the company has focused much of its headquarters growth after building out its Seattle campus. Some workers say the company is still struggling to host employees three days a week. In recent interviews, employees complained of working from shared desks, crowded corporate canteens and a lack of conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. The company has added a feature to its room-reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work. It is not an ideal moment to be seeking new office space. While vacancies soared as remote work surged during the pandemic, there is now a shortage of the high-quality space typically leased by tech companies. Amazon has been leasing temporary space from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley in recent weeks, a WeWork spokesperson confirmed. Coming out of the pandemic, Amazon froze hiring and tapped the brakes on its own real estate development, pausing high-profile office projects in Bellevue, Nashville, and at the company’s second headquarters campus in Arlington, Virginia. Some of those projects have since resumed and could eventually ease the strain. A spokesperson said that in most cases, the RTO delays are the result of reconfigurations of buildings that had been laid out to accommodate part-time remote workers, rather than a lack of available office space.

Title: The word business leaders use to hedge when staff ask if they're planning a return to 5 days in the office

Executives at major companies are referencing a specific term to hedge when asked by employees if they plan to follow in Amazon's footsteps and implement a return to 5 days a week in the office. That word? Productivity. While Amazon has been the most high-profile example this year of a full return to office policy, set to go into effect in January, telecom giant AT&T has also elected to double down on in-person work with a similar 5-day policy, Business Insider first reported. In the wake of Amazon's announcement, executives at both Google and Microsoft, which require employees to be in the office at least 3 days a week, have fielded questions from staff wondering if the days of hybrid work are numbered. Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and AI, Scott Guthrie, said the company wouldn't change the hybrid work policy unless it noticed a drop in productivity, BI reported in September. In October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company had no plans to order employees back to the office, so long as employees remain productive during their at-home work days, BI previously reported. Over at Meta, Mark Zuckerberg said last year that "early analysis of performance data," indicated productivity increases for early-career engineers in the office at least 3 days a week. A few months later, the company announced it was requiring employees to return to the office 3 days a week. Executives at Dell called the company's sales team back to the office 5 days a week starting at the end of September, writing in a memo, "Our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite." Though Amazon did not explicitly name productivity as a reason for its full return to the office, CEO Andy Jassy emphasized a similar term: effectiveness. Being back in person 5 days a week makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another," he wrote at the time. For those committing to a full return to office, preparing campuses for the influx of employees in the new year is its own challenge. Amazon has since delayed the announced January 2 effective date of the new mandate for some employees because it doesn't have enough office space in some locations, BI reported earlier this month. As CEOs and company leaders keep an eye on how employees in remote or hybrid setups perform, various studies since the onset of the pandemic have attempted to measure and compare the productivity of employees who work at home and in-office. Research studies have produced conflicting results, further complicated by the matter of how best to define or measure productivity. Goldman Sachs, which has a 5-day-in-office policy, reviewed several analyses that used different ways of evaluating changes in work-from-home productivity, from call-center workers who were randomly chosen to work from home to comparing the productivity of randomly assigned remote workers with their in-office peers. In short, it's hard to say for sure, and executives are deciding what their long-term setup will be after a year in which some of the world's biggest companies put a renewed focus on being "lean" and "efficient." Meanwhile, some employees have returned to commuting in (sometimes "coffee-badging" in and returning home), others have relocated to comply with a policy change, and some have resigned to pursue a hybrid or fully remote opportunity. As companies tighten their belts and conduct layoffs, other workers have taken to workplace forums to wonder if some of the RTO mandates have been a possible "quiet layoffs" tactic. As more major global companies revisit their policies and make changes, CEOs are likely to face more questions on the topic going into the new year. For some, the answer is simple: Stay productive and we'll stay flexible. Jump to

Title: AT&T, Sweetgreen Follow Amazon’s Lead With New Return-to-Office Mandates

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Telecom giant at&t and salad chain Sweetgreen are the latest companies to follow in Amazon’s footsteps when it comes to return-to-office mandates for 2025. AT&T will require all corporate staffers to go into the office five days per week starting in January, while Sweetgreen’s non-frontline employees will be expected in the office four days per week in the new year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. The specific policies for each company will vary by organization and location, Bloomberg reported. Both companies switched from their current policy requiring workers in the office roughly three days a week to the new mandates after Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy announced in September that all of the tech giant’s office workers must return to their desks five days per week in 2025. “That was the big turning point where everyone’s like, ‘Oh, they’re doing it, now we can do it,’” Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman told Bloomberg. A spokesperson for Sweetgreen did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. AT&T’s employees, meanwhile, have largely already been working in the office five days a week, even during the pandemic, a spokesperson for the company told Commercial Observer. “We always adapt our workforce model to drive collaboration and innovation to deliver the best support for our customers,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “As we continue to evolve our model, we are enhancing our facilities and workspaces, adapting our benefits programs, and incorporating best practices to ensure our employees are best equipped to serve our customers.” AT&T is tightening its return-to-office policy after CEO John Stankey said in 2023 that more than 60,000 managers would have to relocate amid an office consolidation, with some suggesting the move was a cover-up for mass layoffs, Bloomberg reported. Ever since Amazon’s announcement in September, more and more companies have formed their own return-to-office mandates. That includes Starbucks, which told its corporate staff in October they must work in the office three days per week starting next year, or else they could be fired, CO reported.

Title: Amazon Delays Return-to-Office Mandate in Several Cities for Lack of Office Space
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-delays-return-to-office-mandate-in-several-cities-for-lack-of-office-space-2000540406

Full Content:
Amazon will delay a requirement that all employees work from the office in at least seven major cities, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The reason? The online retail giant just doesn’t have enough office space for their employees to work. Amazon first announced in September that corporate employees would soon need to work from the office five days a week, something that has roiled workers who have found many companies offering more flexible work-from-home arrangements since the start of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The start of this new return-to-office mandate was supposed to be the start of the new year. But workers in at least seven cities have been told they won’t need to come into the office that frequently until more office space is found, according to Bloomberg. The cities include Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, New York, and Phoenix, and it’s not clear how many of Amazon’s 350,000 corporate employees globally will be impacted, though Amazon told Bloomberg the “vast majority” of workers will return to the office on Jan. 2. Why does Amazon want workers to return to the office? When Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced the move in a blog post on Sept. 16, he tossed out a slew of buzzwords that don’t actually mean anything and were incredibly confusing. One sentence that sticks out was filled with so many commas and semicolons you’d be hard-pressed to find any succinct meaning in it at all: I’ve previously explained these benefits (February 2023 post), but in summary, we’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another. Okay. What’s the real reason Amazon would be doing this? There are two dominant theories. The first is that commercial real estate has suffered since the onset of the covid pandemic and artificially propping up real estate values helps the ruling class. It’s funny, of course, that Amazon is struggling to find enough office space in this scenario. The second theory is that Amazon wants to do layoffs but instead is opting to make things harder for employees as a way to get workers to quit on their own. When you lay corporate workers off it’s often necessary to provide severance, but if someone quits on their own, the company doesn’t need to deal with those extra costs. This strategy isn’t new but does seem to encourage the most sought-after employees to leave since they can find work at competing companies. In fact, a recent study found that companies that had the most strict return-to-office mandates had higher turnover rates and were losing their most senior and skilled employees. Female employees had a turnover rate three times higher than men, likely as a result of women bearing a higher burden for childcare and domestic responsibilities in the U.S. When Amazon finally finds enough office space to house all its employees, workers will still be confronted with the fact that modern office design is garbage. American businesses have built communal working spaces where people work individually and enclosed rooms that can be rented for big meetings that would be ideal for individuals. That creates unnecessary conflict in the office. From Bloomberg: Some workers say the company is still struggling to host people three days a week. In recent interviews, employees complained of working from shared desks, crowded corporate canteens and a lack of conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. The company has added a feature to its room reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work. But what are you going to do? Work from home and actually get some work done? That’s not going to keep those commercial real estate prices up, is it?

Title: Swiss fintech startup tiun raises $2.5 million to modernise media monetision

tiun, a fintech helping media providers to attract, engage and convert younger audiences, is today announcing a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful. The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. 0 18 December 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure.The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users, and increase customer spending and engagement.Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.”tiun enters the market at a time the news media industry is in financial freefall. A lack of revenue is causing significant layoffs throughout the industry. Estimates by the Press Gazette suggest that 2,500 media jobs have been cut in the US and UK this year alone. Big-name takeovers in the US haven’t yet solved the problem, either. Over the past decade, Jeff Bezos, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, and Marc Benioff bought The Washington Post, LA Times, and Time Magazine, respectively. Despite their backing, those three publications alone lost an estimated $150 million in 2023. tiun builds the infrastructure that allows younger audiences to connect their wallet with an online service in a few clicks to access and pay for media, allowing them to pay for the time they consume. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, "The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure.The tiun infrastructure can track activity and end the session if there is no movement after a given time, preventing users from overspending. To incentivize uptake, tiun limits the amount media providers can charge users to a maximum of 20% of what a monthly subscription would cost. Once those limits are reached, the remainder of the month is free. The data and insights gathered by the platform can be used to inform media strategies to ensure media is as engaging as possible. Bertie Highmore, Head of Investments at Blue Wire Capital says, “The tiun team have extensive experience in - and demonstrated ability for - building, launching and scaling digital platforms. Strong appetite has already been shown for their product, which solves one of the biggest emerging issues in online media. We’re excited to be on board, and are looking forward to what will be a huge next twelve months for them.”The tiun team is delighted to raise its initial funding round to develop a first-of-its-kind solution to modernize the way online media providers charge for their services. The team will share a series of exciting updates in the coming year.

Title: The Game Awards' first Game Changers recipient responds to "hateful" and "disturbing" comments accusing him of fraud

"This is the 'reward' for two years of service." Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife. Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host Geoff Keighley's way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way". Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent. "Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a LinkedIn post. "People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement." Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote. However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate. "I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments." He has also never laid employees off. "They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said. "I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know." He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service." Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service". Astro Bot won multiple awards on the night, including Game of the Year, as did Balatro and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji posted a long comment on his disappointment at the game not winning the top prize, despite taking home Best Action Game and the Players' Voice award.

Title: Citi's annual review process is kicking off. Here's an inside look at its unpopular method.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/citibank-annual-employee-review-process-rankings-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:13:01Z

Citigroup welcomed 344 new managing directors earlier this month, marking its biggest class in years. Behind the scenes, the promotion process can be political and fraught, pitting employees against each other, four current and former managing directors told Business Insider. Citi evaluates employees on a forced curve, requiring managers to rank them from best to worst using a four-level scale with a certain percentage in each bucket. This system means there's a finite number of top ratings, so employees could exceed all the requirements of their role and still receive a middling grade, said the employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We are a company filled with hardworking, achievement-oriented colleagues and we embrace meritocracy," a Citi spokesperson told BI in a written statement. "Our process aims to ensure that colleagues across Citi are held to consistent standards and are assessed by those who have the most direct knowledge of their contributions." Over the years, the percentage ranges for each bracket have shifted slightly. A managing director said this year each business line could assign top ratings of 1 ("exemplary") and 2 ("exceeds expectations") to 5% to 10% and 15% to 30% of staff, respectively. The lion's share of employees — 50% to 65% — are labeled as "valued contributors." The remaining 3% to 7% who receive a 4 rating ("needs improvement") may face consequences such as being put on a performance improvement plan or losing bonus eligibility. "It creates an air of distrust inside of cultures and a lot of anxiety for employees that are high performers but may not be recognized for the work they do," John Frehse, a senior managing director at the management consultancy Ankura, said about the ranking practice. The same morning the new class of managing directors was announced, Citi held a virtual town hall for employees. During the Q&A session, human resources addressed an employee's written question that noted the forced distribution system could be unfair to small, high-performing teams. Sara Wechter, Citi's head of human resources, replied that there was no forced bell curve. A senior Citi executive familiar with the process told BI that Citi's curve is not forced as it uses brackets rather than fixed percentages. "We have guidelines associated with ratings, which is different from a forced curve," he said. That reasoning is of little comfort to employees BI spoke to who assign those ratings. "They are playing with words," said a managing director in the wealth division. "We were mandated to strictly follow the prescribed curve." This season's annual reviews, which began last week, play a key role in bonus allocations and promotions, including to managing director. They come at a tense time for Citi's workforce. As part of CEO Jane Fraser's mission to turn around the bank, Citi has laid off 7,000 employees and divested from several businesses. The overhaul isn't over, with the bank planning to cut 20,000 jobs from its workforce of more than 200,000 employees by 2026. Amid these changes, the managing director said there's more anxiety about the review process and uncertainty about bonuses. Grading on a forced curve is not unique to Citi. The practice, otherwise known as stack ranking, was popularized in the 1980s when General Electric's former CEO Jack Welch used it to cut bottom performers. However, this "rank and yank" tactic has fallen out of fashion with many major companies such as Microsoft and Amazon. Most banks engage in some form of stack ranking but the details differ, such as how strictly they adhere to a curve or the grading criteria they use. Morgan Stanley uses a five-point scale. Goldman Sachs has changed its system several times and, beginning in 2020, it's used a three-level system. "Good companies try to distinguish between the higher and lower performers and do that in terms of how people get raises, what their total compensation would be," said Anthony Nyberg, a professor of management at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina. Citi employees receive two main ratings with each one graded on a curve, two ex-managing directors said. The two criteria are the "what," which measures an employee's results, such as revenue metrics, and the "how," which evaluates their approach and leadership abilities. This means employees get a combination score such as 1-2. While it is not a hard and fast rule, Citi employees are usually expected to earn top ratings for two to three consecutive years to receive a promotion, so the review process puts aspiring directors and managing directors under enormous pressure, three of the managing directors told BI. Direct managers submit their ratings for review before having a so-called "calibration" meeting with their fellow managers, the top manager of their business unit, and an HR representative, the two former executives said. At these meetings, direct managers review an employee's scores and make a case for why the employee deserves a coveted 1 or 2. After these calibration meetings, the top manager makes the final call on rankings. The outcome often disappoints managers and their reports, who may have never worked directly with the decision-maker, the managing directors said. The senior executive said that small teams of three or four employees can secure exemptions to the curve. As for large teams with high performers, he said there might be exceptions on a year-to-year basis but he wasn't aware of any ever happening. The evaluation process was described as contentious and stressful by the current and former managing directors, all of whom were responsible for rating employees. The calibration meetings were especially heated, with managers butting heads over which employees received the limited high ratings. Given the number of top rankings is fixed, managers were typically unwilling to budge on the 1s and 2s they were allotted, even if another manager argued they had more high performers. "No one was like, 'You can take mine,'" said one of the ex-managing directors, who left Citi this year. "We fought." The managers took issue with other aspects of the grading process. By implementing a curve on the team level, employees were sometimes compared to others with vastly disparate roles or responsibilities. Two of the ex-managing directors described some of the grading criteria as nebulous. For instance, they said, for employees with non-revenue-generating roles, the "what" score is effectively up to the manager's discretion. Frehse told BI that the biggest flaw with stacked ranking is that performance reviews are inherently subjective. "Stack ranking is inaccurate from the start," he said. "You're either only looking at the quantitative side, forgetting about the other side, or you're looking at both. And we know that the qualitative side is flawed and subjective." Frehse said that leaves room for employees to believe favoritism is at work. Three of the managing directors told BI that they believed internal politics played a role in how employees were ranked and which managers received top ratings for their direct reports. "When you use such a system, it tells you you can't trust different managers to be good managers," said one of the former managing directors. The senior executive said that the many calibration meetings he attended were productive. "It's just a way to get together, get out of the silos, and make sure that there's fairness and perspective that goes beyond your own team," he said. While he maintained that he had not seen hostile calibration meetings, he said that some conversations could get heated. "This is a very human thing when you have finite anything, and obviously we have finite compensation," he said. "Of course, people are aware of that, but I don't think it's a flaw in the design. I think that's just part of being human." At its best, stacked ranking should reduce anxiety among employees, Nyberg said. "People get very upset when things appear to be arbitrary, and the ranking system should actually reduce some of that as long as people can believe that you're doing those rankings in some sort of objective way," he said. However, it's hard for employees to trust the system if they lose trust in their employers, which often happens after layoffs, Nyberg said. "It's that contract between the organization and the employees starts to feel really violated that way, and then that permeates everything about it," he said, "then you wouldn't believe anything they say."

The first Game Changers award winner says "disturbing" comments about him and his family have followed his acceptance speech. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amir Satvat, the recipient of the first "Game Changers" award at this year's Game Awards, says he's received "countless hateful messages" as well as "disturbing comments" following his acceptance of the award last week, including antisemitic remarks about his wife. "I am continuing to do my best to tune this out but it is quite extreme," Satvat said in a LinkedIn post. During the event, Geoff Keighley admitted that he's "struggled" to know how best to address the unprecedented rash of games industry layoffs we've seen over the past few years. It was the first time the host and producer directly addressed layoffs at the awards, and the solution he came up with was to honor Satvat, a figure well-known in the games business for his efforts to help laid-off developers find new work. A brief video segment described how Satvat's project has helped "place nearly 3,000 people in jobs," and Satvat accepted the award with a tearful speech in which he challenged the crowd to make the industry better. Many viewers responded positively to the segment, including viewers in the industry, but some have criticized it as a cynical attempt to keep up the appearance of caring while celebrating the very people responsible for the poor state of the business—the executives in the audience whose companies ultimately fund The Game Awards. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who oversaw Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the subsequent layoffs, is on the show's advisory board, for example. Some critics went well beyond denouncing the awards, however: After the ceremony, Satvat himself came under attack for his job at Tencent, where he's been a business development director for about a year and a half. The suggestion going around social media is that Satvat was presented as a kind of folk hero, but is actually part of the problem—or even a sinister "industry plant" whose heartwarming story was entirely manufactured. Satvat says that his job wasn't mentioned during the show because it's irrelevant. He began providing games industry job hunting resources before he started work at Tencent last year, and says that he doesn't deal with mergers there, didn't at his previous job at Amazon, and has never laid anyone off. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. "I've never signed a contract or personally been part of a deal that led to job losses in my career," wrote Satvat. "In fact, in some instances, like at [Amazon Web Services], I put great effort into making sure hundreds of peoples' jobs were saved during moments of restructuring. "I've also been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into,' usually by people who spent all of 8 seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across 5 different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know." I was aware of Satvat prior to the awards because, in the course of covering the industry's layoffs over the past couple years, his name has repeatedly come up in the aftermath of job cuts as the person out-of-work developers should seek out. I've understood him to be a well-liked figure whose efforts are genuinely appreciated by game developers who've lost their jobs over the past two years. That impression is reflected in the many positive comments posted about Satvat following his acceptance speech, such as in the replies to this post on BlueSky. "Amir got me a union job in Game Dev in 2024," reads one. "He deserves the world." The criticism, insults, and accusations Satvat is otherwise receiving don't appear to come from any one perspective—good faith criticism of The Game Awards is mixed in with shouting about China, antisemitism, and other staples of internet discourse most associated today with X. "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry—this is the 'reward' for two years of service," Satvat wrote. "...I did not want to say anything but there have been too many comments about my family, about my wife, about her religious background, and other things that are way over the line for me not to say anything." Satvat says that the post will be his last word on the negative comments, and that he will continue to pursue "positive, public service." Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call "boomer shooters" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

Atlassian Take the annual Work Life survey – your insights really help. Adapting to Change: How Key Trends in Data, AI, and Design-Led Innovation Will Shape the Future of Products Head of Design, Growth In today’s fast-paced tech landscape, adaptability is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Globally, we are witnessing a profound transformation in how technology and design come together to address real human problems in powerful ways. As designers, we have both the opportunity and responsibility to shape this next decade of evolution—not just responding to change, but actively leaning into it. Two decades ago, product design was often an afterthought—a cosmetic touch-up to existing ideas. This was the “Lipstick-on-the-Pig” era when designers were brought in at the end to “make it pretty,” focusing solely on typography, color, and layout without considering the deeper problems. Design was disconnected from business/product strategy, and the most exciting work was typically found in agencies, leaving in-house design a distant second. Everything changed in 2007 with the iPhone. It wasn’t just another product; it was a seismic shift that redefined the importance of intuitive user experience and sophisticated design. Apple’s meticulous focus on the end-to-end journey—from unboxing to the seamless integration of hardware and software set a new benchmark. The App Store revolutionized how we accessed consumer products, establishing a new standard that required a structured approach with Apple’s human interface guidelines as the foundation for consistency. This era proved that good design is indeed good business, transforming the roles of designers, engineers, product managers, and marketers in ways we couldn’t have imagined. The iPhone didn’t just revolutionize mobile devices—it democratized access to information, opening the door for an entirely new generation of digital products. The 2010s were a transformative decade for design as we saw the rise of iconic platforms like Airbnb, Instagram, and Uber, which quickly became essential parts of our daily lives. These disruptors proved that innovative product experience, driven by user-centric thinking, could reshape entire industries. Meanwhile, companies that failed to adapt—like Blockbuster, Kodak, and Borders were left behind, overtaken by nimble upstarts like Netflix, Instagram, and Amazon – who leveraged technology and design to deliver superior experiences and enduring value. Another key milestone in the evolution of craft-focused, small-“d” “design” was the mainstream adoption of Design Thinking, championed by institutions like IDEO and Stanford’s d.school. This inclusive approach expanded the role of strategy-driven, capital-”D” “Design” beyond aesthetics, involving non-designers in crafting user experiences. Enterprise companies began to realize the transformative power of Design, reimagining their clunky enterprise software into consumer-grade experiences that became a competitive advantage. I was fortunate to be part of this movement at SAP, co-founding the AppHaus (a think-take innovation center) that transformed enterprise products. SAP, along with companies like IBM, Cisco, and Google, reimagined the design of enterprise products and elevated it from second-class citizen to a critical driver of business success. This decade was a remarkable period for Design innovation, with breakthroughs like responsive and mobile-first Design redefining user interaction across devices. The emergence of Design systems streamlined experiences, allowing for scalable, unified interfaces. And the rise of minimalism and flat Design made me, for one, particularly glad to bid farewell to skeuomorphic Design. Wearable technology began to integrate into our daily routines, and voice UI marked the beginning of hands-free, natural language interactions. While technology and engineering often steal the spotlight in discussions around these types of innovation, it’s essential to recognize that Design has been in the driver’s—or at least co-driver’s—seat in generating these disruptive transformations that have reset expectations for acceptable product experiences. As Designers, we’ve broadened and elevated our skillsets beyond our core design craft to encompass Systems Thinking, Design Thinking, User Research, Content Design and overlapping aspects of cross-functional collaboration (roadmapping, QA testing, etc.). As a result, we cemented our roles as integral partners alongside Engineering and Product teams. This shift established the expectation that Designers now influence and contribute throughout the entire product lifecycle. Fast forward to the 2020s, and it’s clear that Design has firmly established itself as a core competency in product development. We’ve reached a point where shipping a product without embedded Design would be unthinkable. The EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) triad is now industry standard, not because it’s a trend, but because we have tangible proof that it works. The real litmus test? Design literacy among roles like product managers, engineers, data scientists, and researchers has significantly increased, thanks to the collective effort we’ve made to demonstrate Design’s impact. In short, Product Design is here to stay. Looking back on the past two decades, I see incredible progress, but that doesn’t mean we can rest on our achievements. Like waves in the ocean, there’s always another one coming—a set of new challenges and opportunities that will require us to continue evolving and pushing the boundaries. Key trends shaping the future of Product Design are like waves—building momentum and power as they approach. We need to be ready to catch and ride them. Before diving in, let me offer a few disclaimers: this is not an exhaustive list, but these are the trends that stand out to me as being particularly impactful for the future of Design. I didn’t invent these ideas; many brilliant minds in tech are constantly looking around the corner, and I’ve synthesized a lot of that thinking here. These trends may seem obvious, but the value lies in how we position ourselves to harness their potential. The first trend shaping the future of Product Design is what I think of as The Data Tsunami in the age of affordable quantum computing. This isn’t just a wave—it’s a tidal force, with data being generated at unprecedented levels from every interaction, both active and passive, across all aspects of life. As quantum computing becomes more accessible, the instrumentation of everything we touch becomes the norm, flooding us with deep, complex data. The challenge for us as designers is to navigate this flood of information with intentionality. It’s no longer about simply collecting data; we must blend analytical understanding with creative intuition, ensuring our decisions are data-informed rather than blindly data-driven. As Adam Grant recently said, “The hallmark of expertise is no longer how much you know. It’s how well you synthesize.” In an age of information overload, the ability to recognize patterns and connect the dots is far more critical than just accumulating facts. The future of design will demand this deeper understanding—knowing how to ask the right questions, combine qualitative insights with quantitative data, and refine our instincts to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape. The next wave shaping product Design is The AI Effect. This one is no rogue wave; we’ve seen it building with increasing force. And it’s here for good. AI, combined with the explosion of data, is unlocking groundbreaking creative possibilities that were unimaginable just a few years ago. AI-driven tools are also revolutionizing productivity by cutting production time from months to minutes, significantly accelerating workflows and transforming how knowledge workers manage day-to-day tasks. The impact on productivity is unprecedented. AI is also democratizing product creation—people without Design or engineering backgrounds are now able to build 0-to-1 products with ease. This will necessitate as designers to be better taste makers by differentiate through experience, brand, and storytelling. But here’s the key: AI is just another tool—one that enhances, rather than replaces, our creative capabilities. As designers, we MUST embrace AI for the acceleration it offers, using it to craft the next generation of products that stand out in a crowded marketplace. How do you get started? Though it may seem daunting, it’s actually quite simple: Go play! There’s a tool for every interest! Dive into an AI powered tool in a space that you are passionate about, and explore how capabilities are evolving. Start crafting experiences whether at work or for your personal creativity. By embracing these tools and integrating them into your toolkit and your daily workflow, you’ll unlock productivity and new ways to innovate and push the boundaries of design. The next trend builds on the power of data and AI: The Interconnectedness of Products. As tools continue to proliferate, there will be a growing need for a layer that makes sense of and connects these products—a layer of true interconnectedness. This is where AI assistants or agents come in, seamlessly integrating and managing information across all the products we interact with, creating a unified experience for our personal, professional, and family lives. These AI-driven systems are set to become indispensable, enhancing productivity and embedding themselves into our everyday routines in ways that once seemed like science fiction. However, this shift also brings challenges: privacy concerns, ethical dilemmas, and the risk of over-reliance on AI could impact our cognitive abilities and social dynamics, manifesting as critical user experience problems to be solved. Despite these challenges, the adoption of AI assistants is a trend that cannot be overlooked. The global market for AI assistants is projected to reach $71.42 billion by 2031, growing at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.18%​. This growth underscores the urgency for designers and technologists to harness AI’s potential while addressing its complexities, shaping it into a tool that empowers rather than overwhelms. In today’s fast-paced world, design is no longer just about aesthetics—it’s the driving force behind innovation and survival. Countless technological trends are set to shape the future of product design, each redefining user experiences. Immersive technologies like AR/VR and mixed reality will transform how we engage with digital spaces. Universal digital currencies will enable seamless, borderless transactions, while advancements like 3D bioprinting and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will revolutionize healthcare, shifting the focus from treating illness to enhancing wellness. Smart city solutions and green technology integration are set to improve urban living and drive sustainability. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. At the core of next generation innovations lies one crucial factor – the user experience solving real human problems or opportunities that will ultimately determine the adoption and impact of these technologies. The reality we must face is that tech layoffs and the displacement of some roles by AI are indeed happening. But even as we navigate these challenges, we can’t lose sight of the opportunities ahead. For designers, Creativity remains our most valuable asset. This moment presents an incredible chance to play to our strengths to craft the next generation of experiences. One of the most exciting trends shaping the future of product Design is The Designpreneur Boom—a wave of designers redefining entrepreneurship by founding successful startups. We’ve already seen industry giants like Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia (Airbnb), Evan Sharp (Pinterest) and Char Hurley (co-founder of Youtube) demonstrate the incredible potential of Design-led companies. These founders didn’t just focus on design craft; they broadened their skills to include marketing, engineering, research, and business acumen. Some of these designpreneurs co-founded with others who had these important complementary skills. Take Dylan Field, for example. He gathered hands-on knowledge across disciplines (product design, engineering, marketing, data analytics, research etc.) that gave him a powerful holistic understanding and toolkit to build Figma into a billion-dollar company. This is super inspiring! This trend highlights a key takeaway—designers who expand their skill sets beyond traditional craft are uniquely positioned for entrepreneurial success. If we want to see more Design-founded startups, our educational institutions need to evolve, integrating interdisciplinary learning that includes technology, business, and leadership training. But don’t wait for formal education to catch up—self-education and hands-on experiences are just as critical. As the future unfolds, I hope we’ll see even more designpreneurs shaping the next generation of innovation. Let’s turn mockups into unicorns. The future of product design is filled with both exciting opportunities and inevitable challenges. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, it’s clear that some jobs will be replaced or redefined. As designers, we can approach these changes from an empowered place. Instead of fearing the shifts, we can embrace them knowing that we have exciting possibilities to influence and drive the next generation of product experience. The need for thoughtful, impactful design will only grow, and those of us willing to adapt will be at the forefront of this transformation.
