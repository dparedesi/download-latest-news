Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In the first 11 months of the year, the industry has recorded nearly 92,000 job cuts, with over 3,200 in November alone, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas. While announced job cuts in the retail industry grew from October, across all industries job cuts were down more than 50% from last month. “Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008.” Some of retail’s biggest companies have announced significant layoffs in recent months. Target announced in October it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles, representing about 8% of the retailer’s global headquarters workforce. That same month, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 roles in an effort to stay “nimble.” Yankee Candle this month said it would lay off 900 people, about 10% of its global professional and clerical staff. The sector’s early holiday performance, however, may make way for additional hires before the year is over, Challenger said. “The increased spending over the Black Friday and the Thanksgiving weekend may give rise to hires in December right before the holiday,” Challenger said. “It’s unclear, however, if those positions will last into the New Year.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts High-priced athleisure isn’t dead, but boring athleisure might be.

More middle-age and older Americans are becoming entrepreneurs and seizing control of their careers. The leap can be stressful but ultimately rewarding—just listen to the people who’ve already done it. If the rise of artificial intelligence has you feeling anxious about your professional future, you’re not alone. It seems that every day there’s another article painting a doomsday scenario for the white-collar, professional worker, whose job will be transformed or eliminated in this career apocalypse. A recent Wall Street Journal story made this loud and clear with the headline “Walmart CEO Issues Wake-Up Call: AI Is Going to Change Literally Every Job.” The story’s message: AI will wipe out some jobs and reshape the company’s workforce. The article included a quote from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who said the firm is “exiting” employees who can’t be retrained for the AI age. Meanwhile, Accenture will continue to hire people who are fluent in generative AI and retrain existing workers to serve clients in consulting and other divisions. It strikes me that the veiled reference to exiting employees meant those over the age of 50. It gave me déjà vu of when business leaders said the same thing at the dawn of the digital age. It’s ironic that many of the C-suite leaders making such proclamations are themselves older than 50 and have no real tangible experience with AI. During the digital shift, the rush to hire “digiterati” 20-somethings kicked in at full gear. Ultimately, businesses learned younger employees weren’t the cure-all for their digital strategies, as more seasoned employees with years of experience figured out how to evolve business models into the digital age. As a publishing executive who had to navigate the print-to-digital transformation, I was easily “retrained” in my 50s, as were many of my colleagues. As for the companies hiring people who are supposedly fluent in AI, it’s too early in the artificial-intelligence game. No one of any age has accumulated enough knowledge or experience to be true AI natives. But I’m putting my money on older employees who helped navigate the digital age and ultimately became experts. For people in their 50s, corporate careers can be treacherous waters, complete with “downsizing” and “rightsizing,” reorganizations, budget cuts, divisional closures, mergers and acquisitions, the cost of senior talent, and the antiquated idea of mandatory retirement that still exists in certain professions. Now add the glaring headlines that companies like Target, Amazon, Salesforce, IBM, and others are announcing layoffs, many due to the integration of AI into their businesses, resulting in what they say is the need for fewer employees. In other words, the corporate waters seem more treacherous than ever—but there is a proven way to take control of your career before someone else does it for you. If you are in mid-career, now may be the time to rethink your future. It might also be the moment to embrace your inner entrepreneur. According to a 2019 study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, nearly 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were between 55 and 64, almost double from 20 years prior. A 2018 research report from Pierre Azoulay, Ph.D., a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, found that the average age of a successful start-up founder is 45 and that a 50-year-old founder is 1.8 times as likely to have a hit company as people in other age groups. It makes sense. By 50, you’ve likely amassed expertise, industry knowledge, meaningful contacts, and either your own financial resources or access to investment dollars based on your background. There’s not only a growing body of research on midlife entrepreneurialism but also books and real-life examples to serve as a road map. Kerry Hannon, for instance, is an entrepreneur focused on career and retirement strategies; she’s also a speaker and author of several books for those at midlife thinking of making a change. Her book Never Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life is a meaningful playbook, as is Lynne Beverly Strang’s Late-Blooming Entrepreneurs: Eight Principles for Starting a Business After Age 40. A key lesson from these experts is to have a well-thought-out idea that may be an extension of what you’ve done for a living, a new dimension to your background, or an entirely fresh entrepreneurial idea. Matthew Grzybowski, a Polish-born American with a master’s degree in international business who spent nearly two decades in consulting and working for a wealthy European family office, is a prime example of the midlife entrepreneur spirit. When his wife, Veronica, took a sabbatical from her job as a Polish-Korean translator and discovered her love of dog training, it sparked an idea for both of them. As residents of Southampton, New York, they saw a need for a holistic approach to dog care that included daycare, boarding, training, and the requisite spa with bath, blow-dry, brush, and haircut. All their guests get individual walks and playtime, as they relax in the 17 cabanas for the pups. After two years of planning and the decision to self-fund, Southampton Dog opened in late 2024. The business is already profitable, according to the owners. “It’s a place where dogs learn and people connect,” explained Grzybowski, who's pictured at the top of this story. “We have local firefighters and front-page celebrities who are our clients, and we all bond over the dogs.” The cheery 10,000-square-foot facility is the first of what Matthew and Veronica hope will expand to at least three more locations in the next few years. My friend Steve is another excellent example of an entrepreneur in the making. After earning his M.B.A. at UCLA, he worked in entertainment, media, and data-analytics companies. At the age of 51, he was laid off when his company went through yet another reorganization. Ironically, his last assignment was building an AI-strategy road map for his division. At 52, Steve decided he was done with the corporate world, but he still had years of work ahead of him and decided to take the entrepreneurial path. He signed up for the eight-week MIT online course “Leadership in the AI Age: Driving digital transformation for competitive advantage.” His goal is to lean into his years of business experience, adding his new AI knowledge into a practice that advises C-suite executives on ways to adopt AI into their companies, including retraining all their employees, regardless of their age. These stories help to animate a major trend in America, where 21 percent of the population is over 55. According to SCORE, a resource partner of the Small Business Administration, 50.9 percent of small businesses are owned by this group. John Melia, the founder and executive director of the Wounded Warrior Project, who also had a long career in both the nonprofit and for-profit space, became an entrepreneur in his late 50s, launching Contender Equipment Rentals, a veteran-owned construction-equipment-rental company in Texas. “I felt called to build something new from the ground up,” he said. “The idea came from my time in the oil and gas company, where I worked in telematics and sold to rental companies. I realized I had the mindset, the drive, and the operational understanding to start a company of my own.” His advice to anyone over 50 thinking of launching a business is to do it—but do it wisely. Life experience, emotional intelligence, and a strong filter for what matters are important ingredients for success, according to Melia. As life expectancies grow, the idea of retiring at 65 is becoming an outdated concept. If you are that age and healthy, you may live another 30 years. It’s the perfect time to realize that entrepreneurialism has no real age limitations. Luciano Bernardini de Pace had a long career selling advertising in Milan (including for this magazine). In his late 60s, he returned to his hometown in the Puglia region of Italy. There he started an Italian pasta company called Luciano.Market, tapping his media background to spread the word digitally, including videos on YouTube and TikTok. He also restored a palazzo in Bagnolo del Salento, renamed Palazzo Bernardini de Pace, a luxury mansion that he has turned into a boutique hotel. According to Bernardini de Pace, he never really thought about his age. He had an idea that he was passionate about and took the risk. For David Harrison, it was his age that led him to entrepreneurism. As a United Airlines international first officer pilot on the 787 Dreamliner, he is required to retire at 65. His entrepreneurial leap has been to go back to school to earn a master’s degree in wealth management at Columbia University’s School for Professional Studies. It’s a 16-month asynchronous program with two residencies, ideal for his globe-trotting schedule. His pivot will be to support his community, family, and friends as a wealth advisor. “I want to be able to help people achieve their life goals, not just their financial goals,” he said. According to the Wall Street Journal story “The New Age of Entrepreneurship: 70 to 79,” the entrepreneurial urge doesn’t necessarily diminish with age. The article included a profile of 71-year-old Judson Vaughn, who partnered with a 77-year-old to create online courses to teach lawyers how to be entertaining as well as effective. Alan Patricof is perhaps the ultimate role model for a late-in-life renaissance. A seasoned Wall Street executive and investor philanthropist, he has been a serial entrepreneur his whole adult life. In his early 80s, he founded Primetime Partners with Abby Levy. In his mid-80s, he became a first-time author, writing No Red Light about his career in venture capital and more. At 88, he was the oldest participant in the New York City Marathon in 2022. A year later, he got remarried. Becoming an entrepreneur at midlife can be both exhilarating and challenging, but for most who have taken the leap, they often ask, “What took me so long?” If the AI revolution is coming after your job, now might be the time to get ahead of it with your own entrepreneurial idea. And yes, you may have to integrate AI into your own business, but there is a big distinction. At least you’ll own your company and never have to worry about that meeting with your boss when you enter the room and the human-resources person is sitting there too.

Title: I was an ambitious Amazon exec who solved my burnout without skipping a beat at work. Here's how.

Time Published: 2025-12-08T10:11:15Z
Full Content:
It was Friday afternoon, and I'd just hit send on my weekly report to Amazon's Retail vice presidents, detailing what the Global Merchandising team I'd created had accomplished that week. I was 38, and the role — which oversaw standards, best practices, and technology for Amazon's 200+ site merchandisers — was the biggest of my life by far, one I'd been thrust into just three months after my arrival in Seattle and at Amazon. I was thrilled (and a bit terrified) by the size of the opportunity, and threw myself into it. Two years in, my team had 18 sizable projects underway. We accomplished so much that documenting our progress in that weekly email took me hours — and yet in two years, I'd rarely received so much as a "thx" in return. "At Amazon, silence from the top means you're doing a good job," a colleague reminded me, with rueful humor. She was right. But the feedback vacuum made it increasingly difficult to know if I was fulfilling my mandate. Was I moving fast enough? Still aligned with their priorities? Anxiety filled the void. I pushed myself and my team harder and took on even more. This is the first installment of Business Insider's five-part series, The Burnout Cure, which examines how people recognize burnout, confront it, and rebuild their lives on the other side. I'd once been someone with passions — yoga, reading, arthouse movies — but all of that had faded. When I did find time for something I enjoyed, I was distracted, worried that I'd miss an urgent email. It felt easier to stay vigilant at all times. As I stared at my email that day, I thought, None of this actually matters — followed by the sense that I had to keep pushing forward anyway. That if I slowed down even a little, my career would collapse. Later in the parking garage, I stared numbly at the car in front of me when it hit me: Is this what burnout feels like? It was. I just hadn't realized it could happen to me. I was a naturally driven person who liked being busy; I thought burnout was for the weak. And at work, it was hard to distinguish between burning out and just keeping up. In school and at other jobs, I'd often wished that other people would think bigger and move faster; now I was surrounded by smart, fun, driven coworkers on that same wavelength. I rarely had a moment of boredom at Amazon, and I loved that. But there was a dark side. Add in scarce resources, time pressure, and our inability to say no — to our bosses, to each other, and to ourselves — it was a recipe for exhaustion. I'd been raised to believe I could do anything if I only tried hard enough. That worked out pretty well when it was roller skating or long division, but it started to work against me by high school. When I earned my first Cs, I saw it as a failure of willpower, not a sign that I had strengths and weaknesses like any other human. I carried that harsh self-judgment through college and grad school and into the working world. My version of self-care was drinking white wine and shopping, which often drained me further. When it dawned on me that I was burned out, I was finally able to face it. And over the next months, without ever saying a word about burnout to my boss or co-workers, I slowly pulled myself back to health. Here's what I did to get there. Shopping is fun, but what I really needed were things like sleep and food. I started reading novels before bed instead of emails. I made a point of eating lunch every day, even if it was at my desk. Occasionally, I snuck out for a short walk around the block. The views and movement left me calmer. I waited for my gentler lifestyle to blow up in my face — all that time working at a frantic pace had convinced me that slowing down would backfire terribly. But nothing happened. It didn't seem like anyone at work even noticed, though my husband and dog did, and I even passed the occasional coworker on a walk outside the building. The stories I'd told myself about being "found out" hadn't been based in reality. I couldn't change Amazon's culture of overwork, but I could dial back some of the work I volunteered for to be helpful and prove my worth. I was someone who'd rarely turned down ad hoc committees or mentorship requests, especially when it could help elevate women. But those "after-school" assignments did little to advance my career. At performance review time, all that really mattered was what I'd done to grow the business. I decided that unless an opportunity offered a clear benefit not just to Amazon but to me —or unless it was important to my boss, whom I trusted — I'd turn it down. I felt like a selfish jerk at first, but once again, the sky didn't fall. People simply moved to the next candidate on the list. When I did say yes, I was more engaged and effective, sitting in hiring loops for teams I was curious about and joining occasional projects to work alongside former colleagues. Fun counts as a benefit, and pleasure helps cure burnout. A day where I laughed a lot, did work that fascinated me, or simply learned something new was a day where I got something instead of just giving. A fear of embarrassment or failure at work meant I was always ready with a fast response to any executive's question, but it also kept me from challenging myself in new ways. To keep stakes low, I began looking for modest challenges outside work that I could squeeze into small pockets of time, like learning to solve British-style crosswords or making a soufflé. Later, I added Italian lessons, trained for a half-marathon, and joined the board of a local nonprofit serving prison inmates. My "electives," as I thought of them, became a safe place to make and learn from rookie errors, reminding me that being a beginner is exhilarating — and that I was more than just my job. I found a therapist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy who showed me how to distinguish between passing thoughts and objective reality. When I thought, "If I say no to this project, someone will think I'm lazy," I learned to ask questions: Did I have evidence of that happening in the past? How about evidence of saying no and still being respected? If someone did think I was lazy, how might I cope? What would I say to a friend with the same worry? I still experienced panicky feelings, but I stopped mistaking them for facts. My comeback from burnout was imperfect and sometimes halting. At times, it scared me to feel calm and well, so I'd dive back into frantic overwork — only to learn all over again that I wasn't more effective that way, just busier. I never worked up the courage to talk to my managers or peers about burnout, even though signs of it were everywhere. In a culture where exhaustion and overwork were worn as badges of honor, I feared that even broaching the topic would mark me as lazy or weak. As a leader, I wish I'd had the courage to push for a broader dialogue about burnout, but I also understand why it didn't feel safe. In an era of mass layoffs, I hear from tech workers who feel pushed to work harder and longer than ever before to avoid losing their jobs. They know they need to pull back, but they're afraid. I have two pieces of advice for people in that situation. The first is to recognize that pushing through burnout won't make you better at your job. The numb, frightened, sleepless version of you can't fire on all cylinders, which could put your job at risk. Prioritizing your own basic needs can be scary, but it's critical. Second, understand that small steps matter. Maybe you're not in a position to turn down extra assignments; maybe the thought of adding an Italian class or half-marathon to your life makes you laugh hysterically to keep from crying. But you can make sure to eat lunch. You can carve out a three-minute breathing space to calm your nervous system. (No one can find you in a restroom stall.) You can run modest experiments, like closing your email after a certain time in the evening, just to see how it goes. Pick something to try, and once it becomes a habit, add something else. The benefits will slowly accumulate, and you'll begin to recognize yourself again. Amazon did not provide a comment for this story. Kristi Coulter spent 12 years at Amazon and left in 2018. She's the author of "Exit Interview: The Life and Death of My Ambitious Career" and "Nothing Good Can Come From This." Jump to

Title: Sony PS5 beats Nintendo Switch 2 to become the best-selling gaming console during Black Friday 2025

Black Friday 2025, while marred by unfortunate events like crazy RAM prices, brought us a ton of great tech deals. Gaming laptops, GPUs, smartphones, wireless earbuds, and virtually every other consumer tech category enjoyed some great discounts. This also includes home gaming consoles, where Sony dropped prices of all PlayStation 5 models for Black Friday. It appears that Sony’s strategy of reducing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles worked quite well, as the PS5 was reportedly the best-selling gaming console in the US during Black Friday 2025. According to data collected by Circana, the Sony PS5 accounted for 47% of the total gaming console volume moved during Black Friday 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2 was the second-best-selling console at 24%. What’s more interesting is that the third place was occupied by the Nex Playground. For the uninitiated, the Nex Playground is a motion-controlled, $249.99 gaming console meant for the entire family. The game library of Nex Playground is catered towards all age groups. So, the console primarily appeals to parents who want to buy a kid-safe console without spending a ton of cash. Another interesting, or worrying, observation here is that neither the Xbox Series X nor the cheaper Xbox Series S appears in the top three best-selling consoles on Black Friday. It is becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft doesn’t really care about the Xbox hardware, as the Xbox console business is in a pretty sad state. We’ve seen repeated price bumps, the closing down of studios like The Initiative, cancellation of in-development games, and mass layoffs. While the company has confirmed that there will be next-gen AMD-powered Xbox consoles, the current state of Xbox doesn’t inspire much confidence in the brand’s future.

Title: Todd Howard says AI is only a ‘tool,’ emphasizes human creativity as Bethesda avoids AI-generated game content

The creative force behind Bethesda Game Studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, Todd Howard, delved into the questionable role of artificial intelligence in game development. The studio director framed it as an invaluable tool while also emphasizing the need for human creativity. Todd Howard discussed this at a promotional event for the second season of Amazon’s Fallout adaptation, which is scheduled to premiere later this month. Howard spoke to Eurogamer’s social producer Mat Jones about the show's expansion into new settings and references to New Vegas. During the conversation, the interview pivoted to AI. Todd Howard said: I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.” He clarified in the interview that Bethesda isn’t using AI as a means for content generation but to streamline internal workflows. Todd looked back and drew a parallel between Photoshop and AI. He said, “I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn’t want to go back to that version of Photoshop.” He believes that AI allows developers to improve efficiency in development processes without compromising on creativity. He further elaborated: But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. Howard’s comments about AI come at a turning point in the gaming industry, where many developers have sought to use AI to boost profitability, but this has led to widespread layoffs. To put things into perspective, a Google Cloud survey conducted in August 2025 found that 90% of game developers are already using AI in their workflows to automate repetitive tasks and cut costs. 95% of developers using AI stated that AI reduces the monotony of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of video games. A staggering 94% expect AI to reduce the overall cost of developing games in the long run. Howard concluded the interview, stating, “That’s our view on it. We want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.” Buy the Fallout: Season One Amazon Exclusive Steelbook bundle on Amazon Eurogamer

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Overheard at DPMS — How agencies grapple with AI in programmatic

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 12. This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It can sometimes be a fine line between a promise and a threat — but that’s where generative AI stands in its application to the media agency world today. At least that’s the biggest takeaway from a Town Hall discussion at last week’s Programmatic Marketing Summit, held in New Orleans as the last of Digiday’s events for the year 2025. Held under Chatham House rules, which provide anonymity and the freedom to speak freely for the media agency people attending, the Town Hall conversation highlighted the confusion and complexity surrounding the intersection of programmatic advertising and agentic AI. There were differing opinions over to what extent AI and agentic technologies are already part of programmatic workflows (and there seemed to be no consensus definition for what qualifies as agentic). What the agency executives did seem to agree on, though, was that AI agents are best kept away from the actual point of transaction between media buyers and sellers. Instead they should be relegated to pre- and post-transaction tasks, like helping to plan campaign parameters and to organize post-campaign performance data. But even that level of AI involvement will require enhanced training of agency employees not just on AI tools (and their limitations) but also on the fundamentals of programmatic advertising workflows for the human employees to better supervise their AI counterparts. The following has been edited for space and clarity. Setting the stage “I think we all know that machine learning AI … from a buying standpoint is already very integrated. But I think what is new is the gen AI, right? And that’s what’s exciting. The agent idea, and this idea of ideation creating autonomy is where it’s evolving. But I don’t think we all know what we’re talking about, just because it is already integrated within buying across Meta, Google, etc. But from a gen AI aspect, I think that’s what’s really exciting. Where we’ve seen efficiencies in terms of our AI that we’re using is helping with media mix models planning. That really helps with efficiencies, as well as automation in general, in terms of administrative tasks, analytics, and aggregating data.” AI used as a smoke screen “Every agency has some level of machine learning being used in their algorithms and optimizations. We’re not afraid of that, but it isn’t very transparent by nature. One of the challenges we face in this industry is now we’re being fed AI as a cover for more opaqueness in pricing, more opaqueness in performance optimizations. Whether it’s [The Trade Desk’s] Kokai’s new algorithms all trying to do stuff for you and saying ‘Just trust us.’ That, I think scares us, because we know it’s not LLMs, but we also know they’re using it as a smoke screen, and we’re not all equipped to poke holes in their theories and push back. I think that might be where a lot of the fear is, because we just see more opaqueness and us having less and less control.” “We have not gotten there yet, but one of the things that we’re working on on our agency is, how do we use the agentic AI to help us explain what AI is doing in our campaigns? But how do we get it to explain stuff? Because if a person makes an optimization, you can say, Why did you make that optimization? What do you think it was going to do? And what did it do? AI doesn’t do that — it just makes the optimization and has a result or doesn’t have a result.” Careful with that agent, Eugene “Agents are built for fetching and gathering. That’s what they do good. They don’t think. You just asked why — they don’t do that. They’re all probabilistic anyway. Technically agents are [Las] Vegas on all the things you’re looking to track, and it tries to get to a better result based on what it’s seen in the past. So if you’re doing something new right now with the agent, don’t do that. They’re not really good at that yet, because they’re working on odds. I feel like we’re probably three or four years away from trusting any of these things.” “AI can be really good for things with defined parameters. But as an industry, we’re kind of lumping in a lot of AI together. For, say, a programmatic media plan, it’s going to potentially hallucinate because things like outdated information aren’t being taken down from the web, and it’s taking that into consideration. If you just let it to its own devices, you’re not going to get best results. But if you use a very clean data set to find parameters of how things should be evaluated, I think it can be very beneficial.” What’s to come? “From the strategist side, some of the programmatic partners actually have tools that will build your whole media plan, right? But what I haven’t seen is the integration being there. I think their dream of it is, click the one button that builds the plan for you and optimizes the plan. I don’t think that’s upon us yet, but I think that’s what may be coming for us.” “All of us are being told that’s what people want — let’s do that. But then you have legal compliance, and your finance team. All it takes is for the AI to hallucinate one zero, and you’re in big trouble. And that’s one mistake that’s going to cost you potentially a client, or could cost you your job. Because LLMs will never NOT hallucinate — their underlying architecture design has that flaw. I don’t know how many trillions of dollars have been invested in this, but they haven’t fixed this problem. They’re like a very smart intern — we’re going to give it information. It’s going to be able to do a lot of tasks that are menial and take a lot of time, and do it fast. But before we do action, we’re going to put it through some of the older models, or sometimes trust the older models to do the actual heavy lifting, because they have experience. We know they work, and we know they can work and they can do it better.” “You were saying smart intern — it’s a six year old. Think of it as your six year old child who will give you an answer whether it’s right or not, because they want to prove to you that they think what you said is important. That’s AI right now. It’ll be different later, but right now, it’s a six year old.” “We’re using AI in pre- and in post-production. Your whole planning team is pre-production. Your analytics team is post production, giving reports back. That is a lot of the day to day job, so that can save us a ton of time. The actual production part is actually a small percentage of our time. We set up the campaign, we run it, the optimizations come from post analytics, and then we go and make the changes. A lot of the lead up is a lot of time that AI can save us.” Accountability “Accountability comes with management not allowing people to use, ‘Well, that’s what the AI gave me’ as an excuse. They have to be accountable to their work no matter how it’s been generated. And I think that’s how we have to move forward. Because if we allow everyone to use that as an excuse, that we’re going tons of errors.” “My concern is on [the 25-year-old media planner’s] over-reliance on AI for doing a lot of these things. Is that going to impact overall foundational knowledge that allows them to make these strategic decisions creatively and out of the box? Because they’ve been brought up [thinking] ‘Well, I can just do all of these things by throwing it in here.’ They don’t understand the why behind it, and then it snowballs 20 years from now.” How to train your AI “How would you train the AI better? The best way I can describe it is, it’s like good barbecue — low and slow. Use older data that’s very specific. It probably comes in slower than what you’re getting from signal-based data, or real-time data and all the rest of that. Not necessarily because it’s better, but because it has less garbage in it.” Does the need to market as aggressively as possible during the holidays offer an opportunity for retail media networks and challenger social platforms to capture more holiday and 2026 ad dollars? The answer is yes — if they can close the measurement and trust gap, according to new research from Kantar. Some supporting stats: “This merger is a reminder that scale doesn’t fix fragmentation. AI only works when the underlying customer data is unified, governed, and understood. The organizations that win in the next phase of marketing won’t be the ones with the most tools — they’ll be the ones with the clearest picture of their customers.” The DSP/SSP company wants to make it easier for buyers to funnel budgets from smaller brands into live sports TV ad avails. Hallucination and latency are two main reasons against incorporating AI agents in programmatic ad buying, though there’s still a place for AI agents in programmatic workflows. Zefr plans to make viewability free to advertisers in the industry’s walled gardens amid growing calls for more thorough verification.

Title: Why Digital IDs, CBDCs, and UBI Will Be Eagerly Welcome

Time Published: 2025-12-06T23:00:00Z

Most people don’t understand why Digital IDs and CBDCs will soon be welcomed by the masses. Here’s the story so far… Recently, there has been a lot of talk about poverty. Mostly because during the government shutdown, the federal government food program, SNAP, ran out of funding. Out of some 330+ Million Americans, 42 million rely on SNAP to supplement their grocery purchases every month. In New York State alone, $770 million is spent by the federal government every month, and California, over $1 Billion. It’s a big deal. As a result, there was a world’s share of celebrity lip-wagging and open wallets. Pop Star, Billie Eilish reportedly donated 25% of her wealth to those solving hunger in the United States. She also did as much as she could to call out billionaires like Elon Musk. Billie Eilish had a message for billionaires at the WSJ Innovator Awards: “Give your money away, shorties."Eilish was one of eight who was honored for her work. At the event, Stephen Colbert announced Eilish is donating $11.5 million of the proceeds from her most recent tour to… pic.twitter.com/K555kWDTZj Musk’s response, he’s going to solve poverty the same way every other technocrat envisions: Poverty can and will be eliminated, but envy is eternal https://t.co/WHn0l2CruD On top of the affordability crisis, there is the more important matter of continual job losses, which are in continual decline across the United States. Tech firms are downsizing while increasing their use of AI. Retail stores are shuttering their doors. Even in Las Vegas, tourism is slowing down. It’s well known as America’s discretionary spending capital. And when spending slows down for the world’s oldest profession, you know you’re in trouble. All of that sounds a bit alarmist, but here’s what I want to highlight. Because AI is reducing the amount of jobs available, AI is also becoming the answer. Although, AI job losses have not yet created a good crisis the government can use to implement Universal Basic Income(UBI). It has not stopped them from promoting it as THE solution. In fact, it is almost becoming universally accepted (even among the contrarians) that UBI WILL be the solution. Bert Dohmen at Dohmen Capital Research writes: The Problems of AI Are Now Being Exposed “The tremendous gains in “productivity” due to AI, which we forecasted, are already emerging now. Even the president’s economic advisor Hassett talked about rising productivity and the many benefits that AI will have on the economy earlier this month. Productivity will continue to soar with AI, which means that each worker that still has a job will be able to produce much more. However, millions of other workers will lose their jobs. The loss of jobs is a negative, so UBI, Universal Basic Income, will surface and send unemployed people a weekly check. The big tech firms are already having huge layoffs such as 30,000 from Amazon and 15,000 from Microsoft. And they are not just low level, but high income middle level people. That income will be missing in the economy.” Here’s what Musk means by solving poverty: Elon Musk, speaking at the World Government Summit: "I think ultimately we will have to have some kind of universal basic income… I think it's going to be necessary.""There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better… The much harder challenge is, how do… pic.twitter.com/mM3wRmJDrL What Most People Think About UBI Most people are still arguing about the top 3 most widely believed problems with UBI: In the world of the technocrats, those are just kinks to be worked out. When in reality, all the talk about digital slavery and the Total State controlling every aspect of your life will only make a lesser version more readily acceptable. Many financial commentators and marketers, radicalize the idea that the government is out to control you. That way, you need to buy their product. Of course this is the way, because we are always either moving toward something, or away from something. In the case of a potential, all-controlling fascist entity, we want to move away. However, it will be a lesser, lighter version of slavery that we’ll want to move toward. It will make the implementation of UBI more acceptable. Open AI’s Sam Altman has already sponsored study after study confirming the positive effects of UBI. Now it is only a matter of seeing what the masses are willing to exchange for the service. How UBI Will Become Eagerly Accepted To understand how Universal Basic Income, along with Digital IDs and CBDCs, will become popular, not imposed, you have to step outside the usual arguments. The debates about UBI being “too expensive,” “inflationary,” or a “work deterrent” are smokescreens. They frame UBI as a policy proposal still undergoing cost-benefit analysis. But by the time UBI is rolled out, it won’t be presented as a proposal. It will be presented as a lifeline. And people do not scrutinize lifelines—they grab them. The bigger picture is this: When fear of a totalizing, dystopian system reaches saturation, a softer version of the same thing begins to look reasonable, even humane. This is exactly how the acceptance arc works. The public is conditioned to imagine the worst so that the “lite” version feels like a compromise. It becomes salvation, not domination. This dynamic mirrors an older system: not slavery, but serfdom. Slavery is absolute. A slave can be bought, sold, denied marriage, stripped of rights, and worked without recourse. Serfdom, by contrast, is a condition of dependency wrapped in the appearance of rights. In Medieval Europe, Serfs—even the unfree ministeriales—still had legal protections. They had defined obligations, not arbitrary ones. They could marry, own personal property, and in many cases were compensated. They were not owned as bodies; they were attached—legally and economically—to an estate. In other words, the serf was not free, but the serf was not a slave. And that distinction made the system endure for centuries. UBI will follow this model almost perfectly. It won’t look like the “digital slavery” people fear. It will look like a benevolent exchange: voluntary, fair, and stabilizing. You will not be “owned.” You will just be economically tied to the State’s infrastructure. You will retain your civil rights, but only as expressed through a Digital ID. You will still transact, but only via CBDC rails that can monitor, guide, and shape behavior quietly through incentives. Most importantly: your dependency on the State will be framed as empowerment. The line between guarantee and control will be invisible because it will feel optional. It will feel earned. It will feel safe. UBI will not be sold as domination. It will be marketed as a right—like healthcare, like education, like electricity. And after enough AI-driven job displacement, enough economic stress, and enough moralizing from technocrats and celebrities alike, the public will ask for it. They’ll demand relief, not autonomy. Sam Altman’s ongoing UBI trials and studies have been like every other entrepreneurial innovation. They have been a slow onboarding designed to show that the exchange can work, that the public will trade data, identity, and behavioral transparency for income security. In short, here’s the defining difference: slavery requires force. Serfdom requires consent. The future itself won’t be built on chains. It will be built on subscriptions. UBI will be eagerly accepted because it will appear to offer stability without tyranny, rights without risk, and security without sacrifice—so long as you don’t look too closely at the fine print beneath the freedom. Medieval peasants didn’t think they were slaves. Neither will the masses.

Posted in: Amazon MGM Studios, Movies, Netflix, Warner Bros | Tagged: Amazon MGM Studios, netflix, Warner Bros Amazon MGM Studios begins its theatrical commitment in 2026, and Netflix should keep an eye on it as a possible path forward for Warner Bros. Yesterday, it became official; one of the oldest movie studios, Warner Bros., has officially been acquired by the first streaming service, Netflix. In many ways, people were not surprised. Warner Bros. has changed hands so many times in the last decade that if each leadership change didn't come with layoffs, it would be funny. There are a lot of big feelings from every part of the industry right now, but getting an idea of what Netflix could do in the future might be as easy as looking to 2026. When Amazon acquired MGM in 2022, the conversation surrounding that move was very similar to the one we had yesterday. Everyone was sure that a studio approaching its centennial had just been bought by the company that symbolized everything wrong in the world. People were sure this was the end for the studio, and we had seen the last of any MGM film in theaters. Then things began to move in what is now known as Amazon MGM Studios. It wasn't immediate, because things rarely are, but in May 2025, Amazon MGM Studios took to the stage at South by Southwest and confirmed their commitment to the theatrical model. The number they gave was 12-14 movies a year, but obviously, that isn't something we were going to see in 2025, so the first year of Amazon MGM's commitment begins in 2026, and they are doing so with some big films. They kicked down the doors at CinemaCon last year with a massive late-night presentation that no one was expecting, with a ton of footage and projects announced and confirmed. If Netflix is looking for a model that could emulate Warner Bros., something the industry should keep an eye on is how Amazon MGM does at the box office in 2026. If it works, there is a good chance they have found the sweet spot that confirms theatrical releases for a nice chunk of films while also acknowledging that not every movie can make it to the theaters. No one has ever said there weren't movies that were better off on streaming; it's dismissing the theatrical experience entirely. CinemaCon is in April, and whether or not Netflix and Warner Bros. show up is going to be a really telling sign for the studios' relationship with exhibition. Meanwhile, we'll also see if the Amazon MGM Studios commitment works out and not so subtly point out to Ted that you can acquire a decades-old studio and remain mostly true to its original intent.

Title: When Positivity Turns Toxic: How Cultures That Silence Dissent Lose Their Edge

Time Published: 2025-12-05T20:15:19Z

In his book Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More, historian Alexei Yurchak introduced the concept of “hypernormalization.” This describes a phenomenon in which an entire population accepts an officially sanctioned version of truth that fundamentally contradicts their lived reality. This emerged during the post-Stalin, pre-Perestroika Soviet era and was, in effect, gaslighting at a societal scale. A similar dynamic has taken hold inside many contemporary organizations, from Uber to Theranos, BrewDog to Careem, where the unrelenting, top-down insistence on happiness and positivity bears little resemblance to employees’ actual experiences in the workplace. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. A series of scandals, whistleblowing cases and public testimonies by employees at these companies illustrate what can go wrong when bosses oversell the good times and their positivity turns toxic. At Uber, for example, a sexual harassment case highlighted the stark discrepancy between the company’s espoused values and the behavior of senior leadership. At BrewDog, an open letter from former employees shed light on a stressful and fear-driven workplace culture that contradicted the utopian vision of the company and its operations promoted by its founders on social media. The core issue with organizations that demand positivity, either as a core tenet of their internal culture or as an essential mode of interacting with their customers, is that it creates a false illusion. Whatever its origins, over time, the enforced positivity becomes misguided, brittle and artificial. Employees are required to see, hear and speak no evil, while their emotional labor is translated into inauthentic performance. Doubts, frustrations and legitimate concerns are suppressed because they fail to align with the preferred narrative of how things are “supposed” to feel. Which is not to say such traits disappear. Instead, they become part of what psychologist Carl Jung called “the Shadow,” the accumulated, disowned aspects of self and system waiting for an outlet, often surfacing in ways that are corrosive and destabilizing. Far from building resilience and cohesion, then, forced optimism erodes any sense of psychological safety, leaving employees fatigued, cynical and disengaged. Performing and projecting positivity that bears no resemblance to reality is both draining and demoralizing. Amazon has long marketed itself as an upbeat company, the bringer of joy, with its ubiquitous smile logo. What its administrative personnel have witnessed in recent years, though, tells a very different story. For all the wellness programs, Mental Health America awards, and counseling opportunities made available to employees and their households, there has been a groundswell of discontent as people have adapted to post-pandemic realities. The company’s mandate requiring employees to return to the office three days per week was far from popular. Many employees had adapted well to working from home, appreciating the flexibility and work-life balance remote work afforded them. They remained unconvinced by leadership’s arguments about the benefits of physical proximity and face-to-face interaction with colleagues. Tensions escalated when rumors circulated that Amazon was preparing to extend the policy to a required five in-office days by 2025. Insights from TeamBlind’s poll of 2,585 verified Amazon employees illustrate the disconnect: 91 percent reported dissatisfaction with the return-to-office mandate, and 73 percent said they were considering leaving the company because of the change. A far from positive reaction saw some employees taking to the streets in protest, echoing earlier walkouts during the 2023 mass layoffs. More cuts followed, as Amazon pursued both bureaucratic efficiency and its rollout of generative A.I. Yet even in the Amazon case, employees felt able, if only partially, to voice their frustrations publicly. As Megan Reitz and John Higgins highlight in Speak Out, Listen Up, leaders are often unaware of how their own status and the workplace cultures they create discourage dissent, closing down discussion. Where negativity is stigmatized, there is little opportunity for challenge, debate, risk escalation or alternative thinking. Many find that when they do speak up—and certainly when they whistle blow—they are subsequently ostracized not only by senior leaders but by colleagues they were once close to as well. This pattern has repeatedly surfaced in scandals involving Uber, Theranos and Boeing. None of this is to suggest that constant criticism or unfettered negativity produces healthy cultures, and can be as toxic as forced positivity. For all the advocacy of psychological safety in recent years, there is a need for nuance and balance—it does not mean an absence of discomfort. As Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues in Don’t Be Yourself, performance pressure, friction and critical feedback all have their place and can be adapted to suit interactions with different employees. Effective leaders know when to deploy positivity as motivation and when to lean into constructive tension. After all, creative friction has fueled some of the world’s most significant breakthroughs. Without it, many transformative ideas would have never survived. The challenge—and the opportunity—is finding a middle ground between toxic positivity and unchecked venting. Healthy cultures make room for candor, dissent and complexity. They treat discomfort as information, not insubordination. They recognize that negativity, when expressed constructively, is not a threat but a necessary catalyst for progress.

In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg recast Facebook as Meta and declared the metaverse—a digital realm where people would work, socialize, and spend much of their lives—the company’s next great frontier. He framed it as the “successor to the mobile internet” and said Meta would be “metaverse-first.”The hype wasn’t all him. Grayscale, the investment firm specializing in crypto, called the metaverse a “trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.” Barbados even opened up an embassy in Decentraland, one of the worlds in the metaverse. Almost five years later, that bet has become one of the most expensive misadventures in tech. Meta’s Reality Labs division has racked up more than $70 billion in losses since 2021, according to Bloomberg, burning through cash on blocky virtual environments, glitchy avatars, expensive headsets, and a user base of approximately 38 people as of 2022. For many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; the metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their phone or laptop. Despite years of investment, VR remains burdened by serious structural limitations, and for most users there’s simply not enough compelling content beyond niche gaming. Zuckerberg is now preparing to slash Reality Labs’ budget by as much as 30%, Bloomberg said. The cuts—which could translate to $4 billion to $6 billion in reduced spend—would hit everything from the Horizon Worlds virtual platform to the Quest hardware unit. Layoffs could come as early as January, though final decisions haven’t been made, according to Bloomberg. The move follows a strategy meeting last month at Zuckerberg’s Hawaii compound, where he reviewed Meta’s 2026 budget and asked executives to find 10% cuts across the board, the report said. Reality Labs was told to go deeper. Competition in the broader VR market simply never took off the way Meta expected, one person said. The result: a division long viewed as a money sink is finally being reined in. Wall Street cheered. Meta’s stock jumped more than 4% Thursday on the news, adding roughly $69 billion in market value. “Smart move, just late,” Craig Huber of Huber Research told Reuters. Investors have been complaining for years that the metaverse effort was an expensive distraction, one that drained resources without producing meaningful revenue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’srequest for comment, but it insists it isn’t killing the metaverse outright. A spokesperson told the South China Morning Post that the company is “shifting some investment from metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables,” point­ing to momentum behind its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg says have tripled in sales over the past year. But there’s no avoiding the reality: AI is the new obsession, and the new money pit. Meta expects to spend around $72 billion on AI this year, nearly matching everything it has lost on the metaverse since 2021. That includes massive outlays for data centers, model development, and new hardware. Investors are much more excited about AI burn than metaverse burn, but even they want clarity on how much Meta will ultimately be spending—and for how long. Across tech, companies are evaluating anything that isn’t directly tied to AI. Apple is revamping its leadership structure, partially around AI concerns. Microsoft is rethinking the “economics of AI.” Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are pouring billions into cloud infrastructure to keep up with demand. Signs point to money-losing initiatives without a clear AI angle being on the chopping block, with Meta as a dramatic example. On the company’s most recent earnings call, executives didn’t use the word “metaverse” once.

Title: Stocks Have Rebounded Ahead of the Fed Meeting—But the Market's Leaders Are Changing

The stock market may not be roaring into the most wonderful time of the year, but it is chugging along. Its next big test, however, is right around the corner. Investors' attention has for days largely been fixed on Wednesday's rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Rising optimism that the Fed will cut at its last meeting of 2025—based on futures market data, it's viewed as a near-certainty—has helped the major indexes recover most of the ground they lost during the volatile first three weeks of November; the major U.S. indexes are within a few percentage points of fresh records as this week draws to a close. A lot changed below the surface last month. The Magnificent Seven group of tech heavyweights— Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—nearly entered a technical correction as investors debated whether big tech was spending too much on artificial intelligence. On Nov. 20, a blowout earnings report from Nvidia failed to put AI bubble fears to rest, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) closed the day 9% below its record high. It's not that long ago that there was serious doubt among investors about whether the Fed would cut rates at its December meeting, the last of the year. Now it's seen as a virtual certainty. That might increase investor appetite for risk assets, but in the runup to the meeting a broader slice of stocks has been climbing. This year’s least-loved sectors, meanwhile, including healthcare and energy, became leaders. More than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index last month, compared with just 33% since the start of the year, suggesting “a change of leadership heading into 2026,” according to Bank of America analysts. Eight of the S&P 500's 11 sectors outperformed the broader index, they wrote, while tech lagged. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, an index that tracks the stocks of companies that move goods and people around the country, rose for a tenth consecutive day on Friday. According to Dow Theory, that's a bullish sign for stocks if observed alongside a rising Dow Jones Industrial Average. (The Dow Industrials rose on Friday, and is up nearly 5% over the past two weeks.) Fed officials are divided on how to proceed. Some policymakers fear that cutting rates too aggressively will stoke inflation, which has run above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years and reaccelerated in recent months. Others fear that leaving rates unchanged will harm the weakening job market, potentially tipping the U.S. economy into recession. The government shutdown delayed the release of several vital economic reports, leaving officials no choice but to fly partially blind next week. The most recent official labor market data that policymakers have sent mixed signals, but data from private sources suggest the job market has continued to soften. The private sector shed 32,000 jobs in November, according to payroll provider ADP. Employers announced more than 150,000 layoffs in October, the highest number for that month since 2003. Wall Street generally expects the Fed will prioritize employment over inflation next week, moving to bring rates lower. Investors see an 87% chance the Fed cuts interest rates, according to federal funds futures trading data. Just two weeks ago, that figure was 30%. Update—December 5, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect the end of trading on Friday.

Title: Meta Confirms "Shifting Some" Funding "From Metaverse Toward AI Glasses"

Meta has officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", following reports of an up to 30% budget cut for parts of Reality Labs. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. Yesterday, Bloomberg first reported that the division is facing up to 30% budget cuts that would primarily target VR and Horizon Worlds. Following Bloomberg's report, other mainstream news outlets including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider have published their own reports corroborating the general claim, with slightly differing details, and the NYT and BI even received an official prepared statement from Meta, which the company confirmed to UploadVR. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," the statement reads. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." Business Insider's report suggests that the cuts will primarily hit Horizon Worlds, and that employees are facing "uncertainty" about whether this will involve layoffs. One likely cut BI's report mentions is the funding for third-party studios to build Horizon Worlds content. The New York Times report, on the other hand, seems more definitive in stating that these cuts will come via layoffs. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses comes just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Next year, our sources suggest that Meta has prioritized shipping an ultralight Horizon OS headset with a tethered compute puck instead of a traditional form factor Quest 4, and the company will be closely tracking how it performs in comparison to Quest 3 and Quest 3S through 2027. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. But this doesn't seem to have gained much traction. Meta is set to roll out its Horizon Studio world creation toolset, powered by the Horizon Engine it built to replace Unity in Horizon Worlds, and the company will be closely tracking whether this meaningfully improves engagement. This relative stagnation in its Quest and Horizon Worlds efforts comes as the company is seeing skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. Back in February, in its Q4 2024 earnings call, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses had sold 2 million units, and in its Q2 2025 call in July said that sales had more than tripled since last year, performing "exceptionally well". In its Q2 2025 call in July, the company said that the glasses were performing "exceptionally well" in the market, with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. During the February call, the company also announced that its annual production capacity for smart glasses would be increased to 10 million by the end of 2026. And in its Q3 2025 sales call in October, it said that it was accelerating this target to reach the 10 million annual production rate sooner, as smart glasses drove more than a third of its quarterly growth. This combination of significant success in the smart glasses space and relative failure in growing its VR headset and metaverse platform business is likely the driver of the company's decision to shift some funding to the former, hoping to further establish itself as the leader in the space before rival products from Apple and Google arrive.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like a helicopter too heavy for lift off, tech companies are ditching anything they don't view as essential to get their AI plans off the ground. Meta is planning to cut its metaverse division's budget by as much as 30% and considering job cuts as part of the move, writes BI's Jyoti Mann and Pranav Dixit. The decision comes as tech companies look to pare back anything not directly focused on giving them an edge in the AI wars. Investors loved the move, with the stock finishing the day up almost 3.5%. For Meta, ditching the metaverse has been a long time coming. (We actually declared it dead back in checks notes May 2023.) During Meta's most recent earnings call, the word "metaverse" wasn't even used once. It's quite the reversal from when the metaverse was the literal inspiration for the entire company's rebrand from Facebook. But it's tough to keep making the case for funding something that burns billions of dollars and doesn't directly generate a ton of revenue. Especially when you need to make room for AI plans that are burning billions of dollars and have yet to directly generate a ton of revenue. Meta is unlikely to be the last company to cut non-AI-related fat. AI projects are really expensive. From hardware to talent to power, there doesn't appear to be a "cheap" way to do it. The space is also incredibly competitive, and even the first movers are feeling the heat. That's forcing companies to rethink their allocation of resources, particularly when it comes to projects that don't get them to their AI goals. Even those focused solely on AI are recalibrating their approach. OpenAI is sidelining ancillary projects to solely focus on beefing up ChatGPT. Tech companies with business lines already benefiting from the AI boom hold an advantage. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud businesses are experiencing an uptick from AI investments. Those players aren't standing still, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tapped a new advisor to "rethink the new economics of AI." Next month could be a good indication of how much tech companies are willing to throw overboard to keep their AI dreams afloat. Several companies conducted layoffs at the start of the year as part of their annual culling. Where companies draw the line will be interesting to watch. Money-losing endeavors not tied to AI will be obvious targets, but what about the stuff that is bringing in money but doesn't fit a company's future AI vision? How much will companies cut from what already is to support what could be? Jump to

Title: AI Update, December 5, 2025: AI News and Views From the Past Two Weeks
URL: https://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2025/54083/ai-update-december-5-2025-ai-news-and-views-from-the-past-two-weeks
Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past two weeks or so: OpenAI declares 'code red' as rivals close in on ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly declared a "code red," telling staff to urgently improve ChatGPT as competitors like Google and Anthropic catch up. The company is pausing new initiatives such as ads, shopping and health agents, and the Pulse personal assistant to focus on speed, reliability, personalization, and broader question coverage. Daily coordination calls and temporary team transfers will support the push. The move underscores intensifying competition and the challenge of funding massive AI investments while still figuring out profitability. Importance for marketers: ChatGPT's road map is shifting toward core quality rather than new surfaces. Expect rapid, sometimes disruptive, UX changes that affect integrations, content workflows, and any planning based on future ad or commerce features. Google tests merging AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. Google is testing a unified experience that connects AI Overviews with conversational AI Mode directly from the main search results page on mobile. Users who see an AI Overview at the top of results will be able to tap through and continue asking follow-up questions in an integrated chat with Gemini. Previously, people had to decide whether to start in classic search or switch into AI Mode. The experiment rolls out globally on mobile and aligns with Google's vision of frictionless, conversational information seeking. Importance for marketers: This further blurs the line between search and chat. Winning visibility means optimizing content so AI Overviews and conversational follow-ups surface your brand, not just ranking in traditional blue links. ChatGPT adds shopping research to power product discovery. OpenAI launched a shopping research feature in ChatGPT that turns product discovery into a multistep conversation. Users describe what they need, answer follow-up questions about preferences and budget, and receive a customized buyer's guide. The system pulls price, availability, specs, reviews, and images from across the web, and users can refine results by marking items as "Not interested" or "More like this." The feature, powered by a shopping-specialized GPT-5 mini variant, currently performs best in consumer categories such as electronics, beauty, home, and sports. Importance for marketers: Early-stage product comparison can now happen entirely inside ChatGPT. Retailers and brands must ensure their product data, structured content, and site visibility align with how OpenAI's shopping system discovers, evaluates, and ranks items. Retailers race to be seen by AI as holiday shopping goes agentic. Big US retailers are adapting to an AI-shaped shopping landscape, where tools like ChatGPT and Gemini recommend products alongside traditional search and ads. With most of the projected $253 billion in online holiday sales still coming through classic web journeys, AI referrals are small but growing and show higher purchase intent. Brands are experimenting with AI-only websites hidden from human shoppers, ramping up blog and Reddit content, and seeking coverage in editorial "best of" lists that scrapers ingest. Early data shows AI-driven traffic rising sharply year over year. Importance for marketers: Generative engine optimization is becoming operational reality. Teams need content, technical SEO, and reputation tactics designed explicitly to feed AI scrapers and agentic recommendation systems, not just human readers. Ads appear headed to ChatGPT's free app experience. Code discovered in a beta version of the ChatGPT Android app suggests OpenAI is preparing an ads feature, with references to "bazaar content," "search ad," and a "search ads carousel." That implies the free ChatGPT app may soon include advertising alongside or within responses. OpenAI has so far relied on subscriptions and API usage for revenue, but IT remains unprofitable and reportedly faces large funding needs to sustain its growth. CEO Sam Altman has previously said he is not opposed to ads if they are implemented carefully. Importance for marketers: If search-style ads arrive in ChatGPT, it effectively becomes a new paid media channel. Marketers should expect auction dynamics, creative formats, and measurement questions similar to search—only now embedded inside conversational experiences. DeepSeek releases open-source models that challenge GPT-5. Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled two large models, DeepSeek-V3.2 and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, claiming performance on par with or better than GPT-5 and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro on elite math, coding, and reasoning benchmarks. A sparse attention architecture dramatically cuts inference costs and supports long context windows, enabling cheaper processing of large documents. Both models, with hundreds of billions of parameters, are released under an MIT open-source license, including full weights and tooling. Regulators in Europe and the US are already scrutinizing DeepSeek over data and national security concerns. Importance for marketers: Frontier-level capabilities are moving into free, open models. This could reduce dependence on a few US providers, but also raises questions about data governance, compliance, and where sensitive customer or campaign data is processed. AI helps drive record $11.8 billion in Black Friday online sales. US Black Friday online spending hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to Adobe Analytics. AI-powered shopping tools played a major role, helping consumers navigate inflation worries, tariffs, and flat discount levels. AI-driven traffic to retail sites rose more than 800% compared with last year, aided by tools such as Walmart's Sparky and Amazon's Rufus. Globally, Salesforce estimates AI and agents influenced $14.2 billion in Black Friday online sales. Higher prices and stronger luxury demand offset fewer units per order. Importance for marketers: AI assistants now materially shape holiday commerce, from price discovery to basket composition. Brands should instrument journeys to understand AI-assisted paths to purchase and adjust promotion tactics, messaging, and merchandising accordingly. EU plans to delay high-risk AI rules until 2027 after industry pushback. The European Commission proposed delaying enforcement of stricter AI Act rules on high-risk use cases from August 2026 to December 2027. The changes, part of a broader "Digital Omnibus," aim to streamline digital regulations, cut administrative burdens, and respond to criticism from Big Tech and other businesses. Affected areas include biometric identification, hiring and exams, utilities, road traffic, health services, creditworthiness, and law enforcement. Proposed GDPR tweaks would also allow large tech firms to use Europeans' personal data to train AI models under certain conditions. Importance for marketers: The delay gives organizations extra time to align their AI-driven hiring, customer scoring, and service workflows with EU rules. However, eventual compliance is inevitable, especially for profiling, risk scoring, and use of personal data for model training. Study finds AI companies' safety practices lag global standards. A new edition of the Future of Life Institute's AI safety index concludes that major AI firms, including Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, and Meta, fall far short of emerging global safety standards. An expert panel found none had robust plans to control advanced, potentially superintelligent systems, despite rising public concern about harms such as self-harm, psychosis, and AI-enabled hacking. The report criticizes both limited regulation and aggressive lobbying against binding rules, even as companies invest hundreds of billions in new AI infrastructure. Importance for marketers: As safety narratives intensify, brands deploying AI for customer engagement, personalization, or support must show credible guardrails. Clear policies, human escalation paths, and transparent messaging about AI limitations will increasingly factor into brand trust and corporate reputation. White House pauses order that would preempt state AI laws. The Trump administration has paused a draft executive order that would have empowered the Justice Department to challenge state AI laws and threaten broadband funding to states that impose their own AI regulations. The draft envisioned an "AI Litigation Task Force" to argue that such state rules unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. Lawmakers from both parties opposed the plan, calling it an attack on state efforts to address fraud, deepfakes, and child abuse imagery. Critics said it would prioritize AI industry concerns over consumer protections. Importance for marketers: The pause preserves a patchwork of state-level AI rules for now. Brands using AI in advertising, personalization, and content generation still need to track state regulations and avoid assuming a single federal standard will override local restrictions. EU edges toward banning social media and AI chatbots for those under 16 who don't have consent. The European Parliament adopted a nonbinding resolution calling for a ban on social media for teens under 16 without parental consent, extending to AI chatbots due to mental health concerns. The move aligns Europe with Australia's stricter youth protections and follows French President Emmanuel Macron's criticism of addictive algorithms and "Wild West" platforms. Implementation details remain unclear, but the plan may rely on a digital identity wallet for age verification, requiring teens to re-verify regularly. Critics warn of a pervasive "digital checkpoint" infrastructure. Importance for marketers: Youth-focused campaigns in Europe could face dramatic access and targeting changes. Age-gating, consent workflows, and channel strategies for teen audiences will need to adapt to stricter verification regimes and possibly reduced reach. EU opens antitrust probe into Meta's AI plans for WhatsApp. The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Meta over policies that may restrict rival AI assistants on WhatsApp, giving an advantage to Meta's own Meta AI. Complaints from smaller companies alleged that changes to access rules could block competing chatbots from reaching users on the platform. EU officials are considering interim measures and note that the case is separate from, but complementary to, digital gatekeeper rules under the Digital Markets Act. Italy's antitrust authority is running a parallel investigation. Importance for marketers: If WhatsApp becomes more locked down around Meta's AI, access to users through third-party assistants could narrow. Brands betting on independent AI agents for messaging campaigns and customer service must track how platform owners control AI distribution and integrations. Anthropic launches Claude Opus 4.5 for enterprise-grade coding and analysis. Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.5, its newest flagship model, tailored for professional developers and knowledge workers such as analysts and consultants. Opus 4.5 follows recent releases of Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 and is positioned as state-of-the-art for agentic coding tasks, outperforming rivals like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.1 on SWE-bench Verified. Anthropic says the model excels at working with spreadsheets, slide decks, and deep research, and will serve as the default for its Pro, Max, and Enterprise offerings. Importance for marketers: Stronger coding and analysis capabilities make it easier to automate campaign reporting, dashboard building, and data exploration. Enterprise teams can offload more operational work to AI and redirect human effort toward brand, creative, and strategy. Anthropic introduces Claude for Nonprofits with steep discounts and connectors. Anthropic, in partnership with GivingTuesday, launched Claude for Nonprofits to help resource-constrained organizations adopt AI. Eligible nonprofits can receive up to 75% off Team and Enterprise plans, with access to Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.5 on request. The program includes open-source connectors to Benevity, Blackbaud, and Candid, plus a free AI Fluency for Nonprofits course via Anthropic Academy. Partners such as Bridgespan and Vera Solutions will support strategy and implementation. Importance for marketers: Nonprofit marketing and development teams gain access to enterprise-grade AI at lower cost. That can raise expectations for content quality, grant output, donor personalization, and reporting even in smaller organizations, reshaping benchmarks for nonprofit communications and fundraising. Mistral debuts new large and small models to stay in the AI race. French AI startup Mistral released a new suite of models, including Mistral 3, which it calls the world's best open-weight multimodal, multilingual large model, and a compact Ministral 3 model for devices, robots, and drones. The company, recently valued at 11.7 billion euros after a funding round led by ASML and Nvidia, positions the models for agents, retrieval-augmented systems, and complex enterprise workflows. Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, lowering costs and supporting on-device use without network access. Importance for marketers: Mistral's open-weight models expand options beyond US giants, especially in Europe. Flexible deployment on devices and lower-cost infrastructure could enable more localized, privacy-conscious AI experiences in campaigns and customer touchpoints. Nvidia takes $2 billion stake in Synopsys to deepen AI design tools. Nvidia has invested $2 billion in chip design software maker Synopsys, acquiring about 4.8 million shares in a private placement and becoming one of its largest shareholders. The expanded tie-up will see Synopsys use Nvidia's developer tools and libraries to build AI-powered applications for chip design, verification, and other electronic design automation tasks. The deal follows a string of major AI investments by Nvidia, including stakes in OpenAI and Intel. Synopsys shares rose on the news while Nvidia's dipped slightly. Importance for marketers: Nvidia's growing influence across the AI hardware and software stack could reinforce its position as the default infrastructure layer. Over time, this may affect model availability, pricing, and performance for SaaS tools and marketing platforms your teams depend on. ByteDance launches Doubao-powered AI voice assistant on ZTE phones. ByteDance is introducing an AI voice control tool, powered by its Doubao large language model, that will debut on ZTE's Nubia M153 smartphone before rolling out to other manufacturers. Users will be able to find content and book tickets via voice, competing with AI features from Huawei and Xiaomi. Apple's Apple Intelligence is not yet available in China, though Alibaba has announced collaboration plans. ByteDance stresses it will not build its own phones and is partnering across the ecosystem. Importance for marketers: In China, voice AI entry points are diversifying beyond a single platform. For brands targeting Chinese consumers, discoverability strategies must consider device-level assistants and super-app ecosystems, not just search or social. Wikipedia seeks more AI licensing deals to cover scraping costs. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales says the nonprofit is negotiating additional licensing agreements with AI companies, similar to its existing deal with Google, to offset infrastructure costs from heavy AI crawling. High-volume automated access forces Wikipedia to pay for more servers and memory, even though its content remains free to individuals. Wales argues donors did not intend to subsidize multibillion-dollar AI products, and suggests technical tools like Cloudflare's AI Crawl Control may limit bots if companies do not pay. Importance for marketers: As key knowledge sources demand compensation or restrict access, training data and content availability may shift. Brands that rely on reference-style content, UGC, or wikis should anticipate changing terms for how AI systems can use and quote that material. Amazon workers warn about an all-costs-justified AI strategy. More than 1,000 Amazon employees have anonymously signed an open letter criticizing the company's "all-costs-justified" AI push. Organized by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, the petition warns that AI investments risk fueling layoffs, environmental damage from energy-hungry data centers, and abuse in surveillance and deportation contexts. Workers say executives overstate AI benefits while downplaying internal dissatisfaction and climate impact. Signers include senior engineers, product leaders, marketers, and warehouse staff, many of whom fear retaliation in a more restrictive internal climate. Importance for marketers: Internal resistance to AI rollouts can affect brand reputation, recruiting, and customer trust. Marketers must factor employee sentiment and social responsibility into how they communicate AI initiatives, both externally and in employer branding. Amazon pulls AI anime dubs after fan and creator backlash. Amazon's Prime Video quietly rolled back a beta program that used AI to generate English and Spanish dubs for several anime titles; the move came after fierce criticism from fans and voice actors. The AI dubs, seen as undermining human performers and delivering poor quality, triggered online outrage, including high-profile critiques from well-known dub actors. Some English AI dubs have been removed, though certain Spanish versions remain. The episode follows broader industry hesitation around visible generative AI use in films and television. Importance for marketers: Audiences can strongly reject AI-generated creative work if it feels like cost-cutting at the expense of quality or livelihoods. For brand content, transparency, creative standards, and collaboration with human talent are essential to avoid reputational blowback. OpenAI to acquire Neptune for deeper training analytics. OpenAI has agreed to acquire Neptune, a startup that builds monitoring and debugging tools for AI model training workflows. The two companies already collaborated on a metrics dashboard for foundation-model teams. Neptune will wind down its external services, and terms of the deal were not disclosed. OpenAI plans to integrate Neptune's fast, precise analysis system into its training stack to expand visibility into how models learn. The acquisition joins a string of OpenAI deals aimed at strengthening internal tooling and capabilities. Importance for marketers: Better training analytics can translate into more reliable, capable models powering the tools marketers use daily. Over time, that may mean fewer unexplained failures, more consistent output quality, and faster iteration on new features in marketing and creative platforms. Russian tech leader compares AI power to a new nuclear club. Alexander Vedyakhin, first deputy CEO of Russia's Sberbank, argues that AI will create a "nuclear club" of nations with their own large language models, conferring influence comparable to nuclear technology. He says Russia must maintain at least two or three homegrown models for sensitive domains and cannot rely on foreign systems. Vedyakhin claims Sberbank's GigaChat models rival top Western systems but warns that energy and infrastructure demands make AI investment risky and potentially unprofitable, especially amid sanctions and limited hardware access. Importance for marketers: Geopolitical competition around AI may drive national preferences and restrictions on which models can be used in certain markets. Global brands should anticipate localization requirements, data residency rules, and political sensitivities around AI vendor choice. Trump's Genesis Mission aims to use AI for scientific and energy breakthroughs. President Trump signed an executive order launching the "Genesis Mission," billed as the largest mobilization of US scientific resources since Apollo. The Department of Energy will build an AI-enabled platform to support research in areas such as energy, national security, and drug discovery. Officials say AI will automate experiments, speed simulations, and generate predictive models to cut energy costs and accelerate breakthroughs. The initiative has no public cost estimate but promises new partnerships with companies, including Nvidia and Dell. Importance for marketers: Large government-backed AI programs can accelerate innovation in energy, healthcare, and infrastructure, indirectly creating new markets and narratives. Marketers in B2B and public sector contexts should watch where funding flows, as it will shape future demand, partnership opportunities, and policy direction.

Title: Dragon Age Day Comes And Goes In Complete Silence Just One Year After Veilguard
URL: https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-day-bioware-layoffs-december-4-2000650888
Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:55:18Z
Full Content:
Dragon Age: The Veilguard December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWareâs fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. Dragon Age: The Veilguard was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare released the gameâs incredible character creator for free and broke down early player choices on social media. This year? There wasnât a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won âBest Gameâ at the Game Awards. If you look at BioWareâs Dragon Age social accounts, the last time the studio used the gameâs X account was to repost an ad for The Veilguard on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developerâs official blogâs last post was on November 7, celebrating Mass Effectâs equivalent âholiday,â N7 Day, which had a small update on the upcoming fifth game and the Amazon television series. Youâll find no such post about Dragon Age. BioWare has admitted itâs become a one-game studio after massive layoffs back in January, so there is no fifth Dragon Age game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG seriesâ past.Â If youâre only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel itâs actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on Dragon Age, itâs another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development. In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and Dragon Age: The Veilguard was thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the Dragon Age team felt like it wasnât treated fairly by the broader company. The Veilguardâs messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.Â After the game didnât reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on Mass Effect, and implied that The Veilguard may have reached a broader audience if it had stayed a live service game no one asked for. So perhaps itâs for the best that BioWare didnât acknowledge Dragon Age this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.Â At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens.

Title: A Meta Success; From Paradise To Ad Placements
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/friday-05122025/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T05:05:58Z
Full Content:
Next Verse Remember when it seemed like the metaverse was going to be the next big thing in immersive technology and internet marketing? Yeah, about that. Four years after rebranding itself for this seemingly inevitable future, Meta has announced plans to significantly cut back on metaverse spending within its Reality Labs division. Bloomberg reports that Reality Labs, which includes the Quest VR device and “Meta Horizon Worlds” product, could see potential budget cuts as high as 30% and layoffs as early as January. Instead, that money will likely be redirected to Meta’s other potentially groundbreaking, definitely-not-just-hype-powered projects, like its AI initiatives and wearable smart glasses. “It’s not that marketers were necessarily wrong to be fascinated by Meta’s metaverse vision – just that the ending was obvious from the start, if we’re being honest with ourselves. To paraphrase “Folding Ideas” creator Dan Olson, the modern internet already handles most of the functions envisioned within the original sci-fi concept of the metaverse, so the idea that people are going to wander around in what is essentially a badly rendered, purposeless MMO game was never going to be sustainable. In other words, you’re probably better off putting your ad dollars in Roblox instead. Apple’s Road Map For Road Maps They say you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone, and that might be truest of all when talking about ads. They paved paradise and put up … search ads. Back in October, Apple started hinting that Apple Maps – a heretofore ad-free platform – will introduce search ads next year, much to the chagrin of many users. It’s a fitting metaphor, really – because there’s only so much real estate left online. No wonder marketers are getting desperate. As search traffic continues to plummet, their online advertising budgets “[have] to go somewhere,” Raj Lala, VP of US sales and development at Vistar Media, tells Emarketer. Navigation platforms are likely to be one of those places, he observed. But on a brighter note for consumers, most people find location-based ads less invasive than those that track browser history. Plus, Apple is good at “ensuring that the brands that are surfacing in these environments are going to be highly vetted, filtered and relevant,” said Lala. That’s something. At least when you see a dozen sponsored results for “restaurants near me” next time you open Apple Maps, the restaurants really will be near you. Go With The Stream Advertisers will never successfully end the fragmentation of streaming media for one simple reason: Roku, Paramount, Netflix, Comcast et al. will never agree to expose their data to cross-channel buyers. The more realistic option is not that they share data, but that the biggest players keep buying up smaller services until only a manageable handful of platforms remain. This has already been happening for some time, albeit slowly. Disney consolidated Fox and Hulu, while Amazon Prime Video bought MGM Studios. And now there’s another big prize on the table in the form of Warner Bros. Discovery. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast are bidding for a chance to fold HBO Max and the WBD studio archive into their own libraries. For CTV advertisers who only want quality supply, the entity that ends up acquiring a service like HBO matters a lot, including their approach to ad load, the types of ad formats they offer and their ad-supported subscriber counts. On the other hand, Paramount CEO David Ellison just sent a letter denouncing WBD’s deal process, The Wall Street Journal reports, calling it “tilted and unfair.” The unspoken wild card here, though, is party politics. The Ellisons are allies of President Trump and Paramount boasts of having the cleanest, easiest path to an approved deal. Netflix has the highest bid for WBD, but Reid Hoffman, the company’s co-founder and former CEO, is a Democratic donor. Maybe the future of streaming media comes down less to CPMs and more to campaign contributions. But Wait! There’s More Cyber Monday takes the cake for the biggest online shopping day of the year.

Title: Employers have cut 1.1 million jobs this year. Here's why.

Watch CBS News Updated on: December 4, 2025 / 3:55 PM EST / CBS News Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020, when companies laid off 2.2 million workers as the pandemic was slamming the U.S. economy, according to a new report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million. Here's what is driving the increase in 2025 layoffs, according to Challenger. The technology sector is leading this year's job cuts, laying off 153,536 workers through November, according to Challenger. That's a 17% jump from the 130,701 layoffs tech firms announced by the same point in 2024. Amazon is among the tech firms that have announced substantial workforce reductions. In October, the company said it would cut 14,000 jobs as it leans on AI tools to boost efficiency. The retail sector reduced its workforce by 91,954 jobs through November, as consumers grapple with higher prices and pull back on spending on discretionary goods. While retailers typically ramp up hiring toward year-end to accommodate holiday shoppers, 2025 is shaping up to be the weakest in 15 years for seasonal work. Retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers this year, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization. These are the other sectors with the largest number of job cuts: Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year. DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding. Market and economic conditions were cited as the cause behind an additional 245,086 layoffs. More than 178,500 workers lost jobs because a company store, unit or department closed. Companies cited restructuring as the reason for another 128,255 layoffs. Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor. Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New data from payroll firm ADP shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The next Tomb Raider game could benefit from a major change

If the next Tomb Raider game remains very mysterious, it could undergo major changes. Indeed, while some rumors suggest that it will be an open world, new information seems to announce a major turning point for the franchise, which could please or displease fans around the world. The last few months have been quite difficult for Crystal Dynamics. Many layoffs took place, which made fear the worst for the future of the franchise. But a series is still in development at Amazon Prime, and while this may seem insignificant, it could have repercussions for this game. Indeed, Story Kitchen recently revealed some information about these two projects, and the least we can say is that they will be connected. That's not all, because from a narrative point of view, the stories could be similar, and it's also possible to imagine that the series and the next Tomb Raider game will follow each other in some way. And if we remain in this hypothesis, the characters could resemble each other, which suggests that Sophie Turner could also embody the famous Lara Croft in the game. However, it is necessary to remain cautious, because these are just simple rumors. Moreover, Crystal Dynamics remains very discreet about this new project, even if we know that it will run on Unreal Engine 5. Therefore, we will have to wait for official information from the studio, which could be announced during The Game Awards 2025. Story Kitchen

Title: Dream11 pivots to sports entertainment, targets watch party experiences

Hit by the real-money gaming ban, Dream11 has changed its strategy to become a sports entertainment platform. The company, with more than 250 million registered users on its platform, expects to capture a significant portion of the ‘watch party’ experience, or people watching streaming content, which India is likely to see explode in the sports segment, the founders told the media at an event. “We feel there is huge potential to build a ‘Twitch’ kind of global platform out of India in the sports segment,” Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), Dream11 and Dream Sports, said. In 2014, Twitch, a streaming platform, was picked up by Amazon for $970 million in an all-cash deal. According to Jain, the total addressable market (TAM), a metric used by startups to understand the growth potential of a segment, is estimated to be $10 billion in terms of revenue. Globally, there are more than a billion sports enthusiasts that can be targeted, he said. Calling it a proven playbook, Jain said the company is spreading its bets and trying to bring something that adds value to the ecosystem. The app will allow users over the age of 18 to watch and interact with their favourite influencers during a live match. While the usage of the platform is free for all, Dream11 plans to monetise the experience through in-built ads, paid shoutouts, interaction with influencers, and an ad-free version, Jain said. According to him, the platform has been built with the aim of creating richer and more immersive sports experiences to complement live sports broadcasts. It will initially target smaller sums, such as ₹3-10 per user per shout-out or engagement. A large portion of this revenue will be allocated to the influencers, while the company will retain a small platform fee, Jain explained. The 2025 ban on real-money online gaming had a severe impact on Dream11's business, resulting in a nearly 95% loss in revenue overnight and forcing the company to shut down its paid contests. In response, Dream11 said it would focus on a free-to-play, ad-supported model. The company has also since entered the fintech business with Dream Money, which will offer a wealth management service targeting a new generation of investors. Mint reported the company’s intent to enter the broking business on 28 October. The company, backed by marquee investors such as Tencent, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global, TPG, ChrysCapital, TCV, and Alpha Wave Global, among others, was last valued at $8 billion. The company, which generated around ₹6,384 crore in revenues and ₹188 crore in profits as on 31 March 2023, has suffered a significant decline in revenues following the ban. “We have repurposed our employee base of 1,000 people to some of the emerging businesses we have under the group. While Dream Sports will have 200 people, the remaining 800 have been reallocated to other businesses,” Jain added. The parent has businesses such as Dream Sports AI, Dream Set Go, Dream Cricket, Dream Money, and Dream Sports Foundation, among others. “A business is built on retention and not just adoption. Both retention of users and employees is equally important,” Jain said. The company stated that it is allowing employees to walk out without penalty for breaching their contracts and has assured that there will be no layoffs in the engineering team. “We will cut costs on operating expenses, such as shifting to a cheaper office, but we do not plan to reduce the engineering team,” Jain added. Founded by Jain and Bhavit Seth, Dream Sports is not looking to raise any follow-on capital and will fund this pivot from internal accruals. As for the other businesses under the group, they will have their own independent growth trajectories and explore fund raises as needed, Jain said. “We want each business to run independently, and hence if there is a need to externalise them and raise capital, it will be done,” he added.

Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years last week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 29 fell to 191,000 from the previous week’s 218,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s the lowest level since September 24, 2022, when claims came in at 189,000. Analysts surveyed by the data provider FactSet had forecast initial claims of 221,000. READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here’s what experts say they mean Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job. On Wednesday, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report may be discouraging for people looking for jobs, but it bolstered expectations that the Fed will cut its main interest rate next week. It’s not clear how much weight this week’s layoff figures will carry with the Fed as the numbers can be volatile and prone to revisions. Complicating the Fed’s upcoming decision is inflation, which remains above the central bank’s 2% target. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation will be released in a government report on Friday and will also be factored into its rate call. Two weeks ago, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. That mixed report, which also showed employers had shed jobs in August, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, as more Americans returned to the labor market in search of work though they did not all immediately find jobs. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until later this month, after the Fed’s meeting, also due to the government shutdown. The government also recently reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. Consumer confidence has plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which has boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its meeting next week. If the Fed does reduce its benchmark rate next week, it would be the third cut of the year as it attempts to support a job market that has been slowing for months. Thursday’s report from Labor also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 9,500 to 214,750. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 22 dipped by 4,000 to 1.94 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than three years during Thanksgiving week, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates. The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 29 fell to 191,000 from the previous week’s 218,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s the lowest level since September 24, 2022, when claims came in at 189,000. Analysts surveyed by the data provider FactSet had forecast initial claims of 221,000. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said that unemployment benefit filings are often distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday, which can cause some people who may have lost jobs to delay filing claims. Still, the low claims figure also suggests that overall layoffs remain muted, despite the high-profile announcements. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. “The labor market is kind of frozen,” Bostjancic said. “Companies are in wait-and-see mode.” Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data.
