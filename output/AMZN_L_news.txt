Title: The Phony Comforts of AI Optimism

A few months ago, Casey Newton of Platformer ran a piece called "The phony comforts of AI skepticism," framing those who would criticize generative AI as "having fun," damning them as "hyper-fixated on the things [AI] can't do." I am not going to focus too hard on this blog, in part because because Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so, and in part because I believe that there are much larger problems at work here. Newton is, along with his Hard Fork co-host Kevin Roose, actively engaged in a cynical marketing campaign, a repetition of the last two hype cycles where Casey Newton blindly hyped the metaverse and Roose pumped the bags of a penguin-themed NFT project. The cycle continues with Roose running an empty-headed screed about what he "believes" about the near-term trajectory of artificial intelligence — that AGI will be here in the next two years, that we are not ready, but also that he cannot define it or say what it does — to Newton claiming that OpenAI’s Deep Research is "the first good agent" despite the fact his own examples show exactly how mediocre it is. You see, optimism is easy. All you have to do is say "I trust these people to do the thing they'll do" and choose to take a "cautiously optimistic" (to use Roose's terminology) view on whatever it is that's put in front of you. Optimism allows you to think exactly as hard as you'd like to, using that big, fancy brain of yours to make up superficially intellectually-backed rationalizations about why something is the future, and because you're writing at a big media outlet, you can just say whatever and people will believe you because you're ostensibly someone who knows what they're talking about. As a result, Roose, in a piece in the New York Times seven months before the collapse of FTX, was able to print that he'd "...come to accept that [crypto] isn't all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built," all without ever really proving anything. Roose's "Latecomer's Guide To Cryptocurrency" never really makes any argument about anything, other than explaining, in a "cautiously optimistic" way, the "features" of blockchain technology, all without really having to make any judgment but "guess we'll wait and see!" While it might seem difficult to write 14,000 words about anything — skill issue, by the way — Roose's work is a paper thin, stapled-together FAQs about a technology that still, to this day, lacks any real use cases. Three years later, we’re still waiting for those “things of actual substance,” or, for that matter, any demonstration that it isn’t a “cynical money-grab.” Roose's AGI piece is somehow worse. Roose spends thousands of words creating flimsy intellectual rationalizations, writing that "the people closest to the technology — the employees and executives of the leading A.I. labs — tend to be the most worried about how fast it’s improving," and that "the people with the best information about A.I. progress — the people building powerful A.I., who have access to more-advanced systems than the general public sees — are telling us that big change is near." In other words, the people most likely to benefit from the idea (and not necessarily the reality) that AI is continually improving and becoming more powerful are those who insist that AGI — an AI that surpasses human ability, and can tackle pretty much any task presented to it — is looming on the horizon. The following quote is most illuminating: Roose's argument, and I am being completely serious, is that he has talked to some people — some of them actively investing in the thing he's talking about who are incentivized to promote an agenda where he tells everybody they're building AGI — and these people have told him that a non-specific thing is happening at some point, and that it will be bigger than people understand. Insiders are "alarmed." Companies are "preparing" (writing blogs) for AGI. It's all very scary. But, to quote Roose, "...even if you ignore everyone who works at A.I. companies, or has a vested stake in the outcome, there are still enough credible independent voices with short A.G.I. timelines that we should take them seriously." Roose's entire argument can be boiled down to "AI models are much better," and when he says "much better" he means "they are able to get high scores on benchmarks," at which point he does not mention which ones, or question the fact that they (despite him saying these exact words) have had to "create new, harder tests to measure their capabilities," which can be read as "make up new tests to say why these models are good." He mentions, in passing, that hallucinations still happen, but "they're rarer on newer models," a statement he does not back up with evidence. He mentions that "...in A.I., bigger models, trained using more data and processing power, tend to produce better results, and today’s leading models are significantly bigger than their predecessors." He does not explain what those results are, what results they produce, and what said results lead to as products, largely because they haven't. He talks about "...if you really want to grasp how much better A.I. has gotten recently, talk to a programmer," then fails to quote a single programmer. I won't go on, because the article is boring, thinly-sourced and speciously-founded. But it's also an example of how comfortable optimism is. Roose doesn't have to make actual arguments – he makes statements, finds one example of something that confirms his biases, and then moves on. By choosing the cautiously-optimistic template, Roose can present "intelligent people that are telling him things" as proof that confirms what he wants to believe, which is that Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, who he just interviewed on Hard Fork, is correct when he says that AGI is mere years away. Roose is framing his optimism as a warning – all without ever having to engage with what AGI is and the actual ramifications of its imminence. If he did, he would have to discuss concepts like personage. Is a conscious AI system alive? Does it have rights? And, for that matter, what even is consciousness? That’s no discussion of the massive, world-changing consequences of a (again, totally theoretical, no proof this exists) artificial intelligence that's as smart and capable (again, how is it capable?) as a human being. Being an AI optimist is extremely comfortable, because Roose doesn't even have to do any real analysis — he has other people to do it for him, such as the people that stand to profit from generative AI's proliferation. Roose doesn't have to engage with the economics, or the actual capabilities of these models, or even really understand how they work. He just needs enough to be able to say "wow, that's so powerful!" Cautious optimism allows Roose to learn as little as necessary to write his column, knowing that the market wants AI to work, even as facts scream that it doesn't. Cautious optimism is extremely comfortable, because — as Roose knows from boosting cryptocurrency — that there are few repercussions for being too optimistic. I, personally, believe that there should be.Here's a thing I wrote three years ago — the last time Roose decided to boost an entire movement based on vibes and his own personal biases. I hate that I've spent nearly two thousand words kvetching over Roose's work, but it's necessary, because I want to be abundantly clear: cautious optimism is cowardice. Criticism — skepticism — takes a certain degree of bravery, or at least it does so when you make fully-formed arguments. Both Roose and Newton, participating in their third straight hype-cycle boost, frame skepticism as lazy, ignorant and childish. To quote Casey: Newton doesn't actually prove that anyone has raised a ceiling, and in fact said: This is not meaningful analysis, and it's deeply cowardly on a number of levels. Newton does not prove his point in any way — he makes up a person that combines several ideas about generative AI, says that open source will “catch up,” and that also there will be some sort of indeterminate harm. It doesn't engage with a single critic’s argument. It is, much like a lot of Newton’s work, the intellectual equivalent of saying “nuh uh!” Newton delights in his phony comforts. He proves his points in the flimsiest ways, knowing that the only criticisms he'll get are from the people he's steadfastly othered, people that he will never actually meaningfully engage with. He knows that his audience trusts him, and thus he will never have to meaningfully engage with the material. In fact, Newton isn't really proving anything — he is stating his own assumptions, giving the thinnest possible rationale, and then singling out Gary Marcus because he perceives him as an easy target. This is, to repeat myself, extremely comfortable. Newton, like Roose, simply has to follow whatever the money is doing at any given time, learn enough about it to ask some questions in a podcast, and then get on with his day. There is nothing more comfortable than sitting on the podcast of a broadsheet newspaper and writing a newsletter for 150,000 people with no expectation that you'd ever have to push back on anything. And I cannot be clear enough how uncomfortable it is being a skeptic or a cynic during these cycles, even before people like Casey Newton started trying to publicly humiliate critics like Gary Marcus. My core theses — The Rot Economy (that the tech industry has become dominated by growth), The Rot-Com Bubble (that the tech industry has run out of hyper-growth ideas), and that generative AI has created a kind of capitalist death cult where nobody wants to admit that they're not making any money — are far from comfortable. The ramifications of a tech industry that has become captured by growth are that true innovation is being smothered by people that neither experience nor know how (or want) to fix real problems, and that the products we use every day are being made worse for a profit. These incentives have destroyed value-creation in venture capital and Silicon Valley at large, lionizing those who are able to show great growth metrics rather than creating meaningful products that help human beings. The ramifications of the end of hyper-growth mean a massive reckoning for the valuations of tech companies, which will lead to tens of thousands of layoffs and a prolonged depression in Silicon Valley, the likes of which we've never seen. The ramifications of the collapse of generative AI are much, much worse. On top of the fact that the largest tech companies have burned hundreds of billions of dollars to propagate software that doesn't really do anything that resembles what we think artificial intelligence looks like, we're now seeing that every major tech company (and an alarming amount of non-tech companies!) is willing to follow whatever it is that the market agrees is popular, even if the idea itself is flawed. Generative AI has laid bare exactly how little the markets think about ideas, and how willing the powerful are to try and shove something unprofitable, unsustainable and questionably-useful down people's throats as a means of promoting growth. It's also been an alarming demonstration of how captured some members of the media have become, and how willing people like Roose and Newton are to defend other people's ideas rather than coming up with their own. In short, reality can fucking suck, but a true skeptic learns to live in it. It's also hard work. Proving that something is wrong — really proving it — requires you to push against the grain, and battering your own arguments repeatedly. Case in point: my last article about CoreWeave was the product of nearly two weeks of work, where, alongside my editor, we poured over the company’s financial statements trying to separate reality from hype. Whenever we found something damning, we didn’t immediately conclude it validated our original thesis — that the company is utterly rotten. We tried to find other explanations that were equally or more plausible to our own hypothesis — “steelmanning” our opponent because being skeptical demands a level of discomfort. Hard work, sure, but when your hypotheses are vindicated by later reporting by the likes of Semafor and the Financial Times, it all becomes worthwhile. I’ll talk about CoreWeave in greater depth later in this post, because it’s illustrative of the reality-distorting effects of AI optimism, and how optimism can make people ignore truths that are, quite literally, written in black ink and published for all the world to see. An optimist doesn't have to prove that things will go well — a skeptic must, in knowing that they are in the minority, be willing to do the hard work of pulling together distinct pieces of information in something called an "analysis." A skeptic cannot simply say "I talked to some people," because skeptics are "haters," and thus must be held to some higher standard for whatever reason. The result of a lack of true skepticism and criticism is that the tech industry has become captured by people that are able to create their own phony and comfortable realities, such as OpenAI, a company that burned $5 billion in 2024 and is currently raising $40 billion, the majority of it from SoftBank, which will have to raise $16 billion or more to fund it. Engaging with this kind of thinking is far from comfortable, because what I am describing is one of the largest abdications of responsibility by financial institutions and members of the media in history. OpenAI and Anthropic are abominations of capitalism, bleeding wounds that burn billions of dollars with no end in sight for measly returns on selling software that lacks any real mass market use case. Their existence is proof that Silicon Valley is capable of creating its own illogical realities and selling them to corporate investors that have lost any meaningful way to evaluate businesses, drunk off of vibes and success stories from 15 or more years ago. What we are witnessing is a systemic failure, not the beginnings of a revolution. Large Language Models have never been a mass market product — other than ChatGPT, generative AI products are barely a blip on the radar — and outside of NVIDIA (and consultancy Turing), there doesn't appear to be one profitable enterprise in the industry, nor is there any sign any of these companies will ever stop burning money. The leaders behind the funding, functionality, and media coverage of the tech industry have abdicated their authority so severely that the consensus is that it's fine that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year, and it's also fine that OpenAI, or Anthropic, or really any other generative AI company has no path to profitability. Furthermore, it's fine that these companies are destroying our power grid and our planet, and it's also fine that they stole from millions of creatives while simultaneously undercutting those creatives in an already-precarious job market. The moment it came out that OpenAI was burning so much money should've begun an era of renewed criticism and cynicism about these companies. Instead, I received private messages that I was "making too big a deal" out of it. These are objectively horrifying things — blinking red warning signs that our markets and our media have reached an illogical point where they believe that destruction isn't just acceptable, but necessary to make sure that "smart tech people" are able to build the future, even if they haven't built anything truly important in quite some time, or even if there’s no evidence they can build their proposed future. I am not writing this with any comfort or satisfaction. I am fucking horrified. Our core products — Facebook, Google Search, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and even basic laptops — are so much worse than they've ever been, and explaining these things unsettles and upsets me. Digging into the fabric of why these companies act in this way, seeing how brazen and even proud they are of their pursuit of growth, it fills me full of disgust, and I'm not sure how people like Roose and Newton don't feel the same way. And now I want to show you how distinctly uncomfortable all of this is. Last week, I covered the shaky state of AI data center provider CoreWeave — an unprofitable company riddled by onerous debt, with 77% of its $1.9 billion of 2024 revenue coming from Microsoft and NVIDIA. CoreWeave lost $863 million in revenue in 2024, and when I published this analysis, some people suggested that its "growth would fix things," and that OpenAI's deal to buy $11.9 billion of compute over five years was a sign that everything would be okay. Since then, some things have come out: To summarize (and repeat one part from my previous article): I'm afraid I'm not done explaining why I'm uncomfortable. Let me make this much simpler. Okay, simpler. CoreWeave's continued existence is contingent on its ability to borrow money, pay its debts, and expand its business, which is contingent on OpenAI's ability to raise money and expand its business, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to give it money, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to borrow money. OpenAI is CoreWeave. CoreWeave is OpenAI. SoftBank is now both CoreWeave and OpenAI, and if SoftBank buckles, both CoreWeave and OpenAI are dead. For this situation to work even for the next year, these companies will have to raise tens of billions of dollars just to maintain the status quo. There is nothing comfortable about my skepticism, and in fact I'd argue it's a huge pain in the ass. Being one of the few people that is willing to write down the numbers in stark, objective detail is a frustrating exercise — and it's isolating too, especially when I catch strays from Casey Newton claiming he's taking "detailed notes" about my work as a punishment for the sin of "doing basic mathematics and asking why nobody else seems to want to." It isn't comfortable to continually have to explain to people who are all saying "AI is the future" that the majority of what they are discussing is fictional, because it reveals how many people believe things based entirely on someone they trust saying it's real, or being presented a flimsy argument that confirms their biases or affirms their own status quo. In Newton and Roose's case, this means that they continue being the guys that people trust will bring them the truth about the future. This position is extremely comfortable, as it doesn't require them to be correct, only convincing and earnest. I don't fear that we're "not taking AGI seriously." I fear that we've built our economy on top of NVIDIA, which is dependent on the continued investment in GPUs from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, one of which has materially pulled back from data center expansion. Outside of NVIDIA, nobody is making any profit off of generative AI, and once that narrative fully takes hold, I fear a cascade of events that gores a hole in the side of the stock market and leads to tens of thousands of people losing their jobs. Framing skepticism as comfortable is morally bankrupt, nakedly irresponsible, and calls into question the ability of those saying it to comprehend reality, as well as their allegiances. It's far more comfortable to align with the consensus, to boost the powerful in the hopes that they will win and that their victories will elevate you even further, even if your position is currently at the very top of your industry. While it's possible to take a kinder view of those who peddle this kind of optimism — that they may truly believe these things and can dismiss the problems as surmountable — I do not see at this time in history how one can logically or rationally choose to do so. To choose to believe that this will "all just work out" at this point is willful ignorance and actively refusing to engage with reality. I cannot speak to the rationale or incentives behind the decision to do so, but to do so with a huge platform, to me, is morally reprehensible. Be optimistic if you'd like, but engage with the truth when you do so.

Title: 2025: The Year Of The Layoffs?

ByWinnie Sun ByWinnie Sun , Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 9: White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk walks to the White House after ... More landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on March 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was returning to the White House after spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) It’s only the first quarter of the year but already layoffs are making financial headlines. Tens of thousands — and more each day — of traditionally secure government employees are finding themselves with a pending layoff. As someone who has worked with employees of varying businesses and entities for over two decades, here are my valuable tips on what to do if you’re facing a job loss. Meet DOGE: Department of Governmental Efficiency? Or Dismissals, Outsourcing, and General Exits? According to a recent Forbes article and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Office of Personnel Management, government job cuts reported across multiple federal agencies number more than 35,000. They include more than 5,000 from the Department of Education, 4,000 from the Department of Energy, 3,500 from the Department of Transportation, more than 5,000 from the IRS, tens of thousands more expected from the Department of Defense. More than 15,000 federal contractors also have been cut. Taken together, they represent a federal workforce decline of 2.5% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. The cuts stem from efforts to streamline government operations and a spending cap agreement passed by Congress. Know that private-sector layoffs are happening, too: According to BLS, Layoffs.fyi, Bloomberg and various company reports, there are plenty of job cuts in the private sector. Some examples: Google (Alphabet Inc) shed 12,000 positions; Amazon, 18,000; Citigroup, 6,500; Walmart, 7,000; Disney, 5,500; Ford, 4,200; Warner Bros. Discovery, 2,000-plus; Paramount Global, 1,800. Job cuts across all industries in the first two months of this year totaled more than 250,000. Unemployment claims rose 12% since January, according to the BLS Weekly Unemployment Report. Be aware that laid-off workers usually are entitled to severance pay and benefits: Federal government employees may receive up to one week of pay per year worked, while private workers are entitled to an average weekly state benefit of $450. The amount varies by state but is typically 40% to 50% of your previous salary for up to 26 weeks. Apply right away because it can take two to four weeks to start receiving benefits. Find your state’s unemployment application portal: U.S. Department of Labor. Explore options for health insurance after job loss: COBRA programs allow a laid off worker to continue for up to 18 months on an employer’s health insurance plan but it’s expensive because the worker must assume the full share of the monthly premium. A better bet might be the marketplace plans offered under the federal Affordable Health Care Act. You can explore the possibilities at Healthcare.gov. The best option, if available, is to join a spouse’s company health care plan. If your income drops drastically, you may qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid. (Check eligibility through your state’s health department.) Review your 401k, Pension, Company Stock and your employee benefits to be aware of what you own ... More before you face the unexpected layoff. Schedule a meeting with a Sun Group Wealth Partners financial advisor today. Understand severance benefits: If you receive a layoff package from your employer, study the details for severance pay, unused personal time payout, stock options, and other possible benefits. Check into pension and retirement savings plans. Use any unused sick days and wellness benefits before your last day on the job. Negotiate if possible, as some employers may offer more severance, extended healthcare or a delayed layoff date. If you have a health savings account, know that you can use your balance for medical expenses even after leaving the job. Do budgeting and gather emergency savings: Cut non-essential spending (subscriptions, dining out, luxuries). Prioritize debt payments and contact lenders to see if you can get a payment deferment or a lower interest rate. Use emergency savings wisely and avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts unless absolutely necessary. Evaluate your financial situation, including amount of debt, amount of savings and all your monthly expenses. If you have time before your job ends, beef up your savings while you still are getting a paycheck. If you own a home, consider taking out a home equity line of credit while you are still employed. See your financial planner for ideas to help bulk up your emergency fund. Begin your job search and networking skills: Update your resume and LinkedIn profile with relevant skills. Reach out to former colleagues for job leads and referrals. Consider gig work, freelancing, or remote jobs for immediate income. Explore upskilling and career pivoting: Enroll in online courses to gain new skills (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera). Consider high-growth job sectors (AI, cybersecurity, healthcare, renewable energy). Explore federal retraining programs available to laid-off government employees (DOL Workforce Programs). Conference speakers handshaking after presentation at the convention center Prepare mentally for the change that comes with a layoff: Stay positive and proactive. Layoffs are often not personal but are done for economic reasons. Set daily goals–for the number of job applications filed, time for networking and for building new skills. Seek emotional support from family, friends or support groups as you navigate your transition. Learn a bit more about DOGE: Created by an executive order shortly after President Donald Trump took office, the Department of Government Efficiency brings a new, controversial wrinkle to a broader effort to reorganize government and cut costs. The initiative to restructure and modernize technology aligns with ongoing federal layoffs as part of this effort. The U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is intended to exist until July 4, 2026, to execute the 18-month modernization agenda. Every federal agency and department was required to create a DOGE team to lead its restructuring cost-cutting efforts. Know the options for laid-off federal employees: They can use the Career Transition Assistance Program for priority job placement.

Title: The tech industry is souring on Trump

Time Published: 2025-03-25T08:06:01Z

Even conservative executives are fed up with tariffs, DOGE, and "crypto bro schemes." Two months into Donald Trump's second term, conservative leaders in the tech industry — some of whom are advising the administration — are in a state of turmoil. They are bristling at how the president's chaotic governing, unusual even by the standards of Trump 1.0, is making it increasingly difficult to run their companies. "None of my friends who voted for Trump are happy right now. Everyone is annoyed," says Reggie James, the founder of Eternal, a new-media company backed by Andreessen Horowitz. "When tech people got involved in the government, they thought Trump was going to take more of a surgical approach and act less like a wrecking ball." Several Silicon Valley executives I spoke to — some of whom requested anonymity for fear of retribution — echoed this sense of disappointment, in particular at the havoc the Department of Government Efficiency has wreaked throughout the federal government. "We were all on board for a more business-friendly presidency, but in the end, the whole industry of crypto and AI got rug pulled," says the partner of a top-tier venture firm directly involved in the Trump administration. "The people surrounding Trump are all scamsters. They are getting rich off our votes, our dollars, and our time." While the tech industry at large remains relatively liberal, especially among rank-and-file employees, many influential players warmed to Trump in recent years. They include high-profile venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, the hosts of the popular tech podcast "All-In," as well as billionaire CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who donated to and had prime seating at Trump's second inauguration. But in recent weeks — amid herky-jerky tariffs, mass government layoffs, and a shaky stock market — some influential pro-Trump players are growing impatient and disenchanted. The consternation is especially pitched among startup founders, many of whom are bracing for an economic downturn. "There is a lot of uncertainty right now, and it makes people nervous," says Sara Mauskopf, the founder of the venture-backed childcare marketplace provider Winnie. Many founders, she says, are deeply worried over whether "they're going to be able to raise funding." Others are exasperated with what they see as unscrupulous dealings with cryptocurrencies. The tech industry itself has a fraught relationship with crypto: Investors were burned by Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX, and many tech leaders regard cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes with little functional value that stain the tech industry at large. Where the Biden administration took a hard-line approach to crypto, Trump has enthusiastically embraced the crypto community. Days before he was inaugurated, he launched $Trump coin, a memecoin that reached a market cap of $14.5 billion before immediately plunging in value; today, it hovers at $2 billion. As president, Trump has appointed the venture capitalist and "All-In" cohost David Sacks as the country's "crypto czar," hosted a Crypto Summit at the White House, pardoned the Silk Road founder and crypto folk hero Ross Ulbricht from serving double life sentences, and signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and US digital asset stockpile. On X, the Palantir cofounder and vocal Trump supporter Joe Lonsdale compared creating a digital currency reserve with taxpayer dollars to theft: "It's wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it's also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes," he wrote. Lonsdale told me over email that he objects to the administration naming individual coins in "a way that moved markets and meant people could trade them ahead of time." The executive branch, he said, shouldn't be in the business of "picking winners and losers." "The crypto stuff smells weird," says a venture capitalist who is a major backer of conservative news networks. "Both AI and crypto are fields that require a specialized, technical skill set, and just because David Sacks is a podcaster doesn't mean he's qualified in AI or crypto." That same venture capitalist who is advising the Trump administration also claims that crypto founders are using their proximity to Trump for personal gain. Steve Witkoff, for instance, a longtime Trump associate who was appointed as the United States special envoy to the Middle East, has been cashing in on his proximity to Trump to secure private deals, this person says. Witkoff's son, Zach Witkoff, is the cofounder of World Liberty Financial, the crypto banking platform that launched Trump's memecoin. Early in March, Steve Witkoff sent cryptocurrency advocates to the Middle East to promote World Liberty Financial's latest stablecoin project, The Wall Street Journal reported. "Steve Witkoff is calling every sovereign government and saying, 'You need to support this coin if you want to be in good standing with Trump,'" the person says. Witkoff did not respond to multiple requests for comment. One conservative entrepreneur suggests that the relationship between Trump and the technology industry was never destined to last. "Tech people don't get politicians, and politicians don't understand tech," he says. "Some of this is because tech people don't really have an ideology. They operate in a globalist, new world order. Trump is only interested in deals for America." This America-first mindset still resonates in the country's more resolutely conservative tech enclaves such as El Segundo, California, an area dedicated to building American manufacturing and defense technology companies. "One thing that I appreciate about Trump is that it's all pretty public," says Isaiah Taylor, an El Segundo-based founder of the nuclear energy company Valar Atomics, who in January presented a briefing on nuclear energy for the president at Mar-a-Lago. "People are concerned about Elon and how his companies might benefit, but the reality is that everything Elon does is out in the open so it's under scrutiny all the time." Others, like Erik Kriessmann, a board member of the defense tech company Anduril, say that the current moment of pain and uncertainty is only temporary. He says of Trump: "I genuinely believe he has surrounded himself with highly competent people who are doing what they believe is best for America and we should be patient as they execute their plan." Still, there's the reality that defense tech companies like Anduril and Palantir, which rallied around Trump given his outwardly steadfast support of the defense industry, are now reeling as Trump proposes dramatic cuts to the military budget. "Democrats think that Trump wants to help billionaires, but that's not the case," says Noah Smith, an economist who writes a popular Substack called Noahopinion. "Trump is kicking the shit out of America's billionaires. To be a billionaire who continues to support Trump even as your entire portfolio plummets would mean that you're an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed, and you don't become a billionaire by being an insane cultist who loves having your wealth destroyed." Smith believes that Chinese tariffs are already causing one of Trump's wealthiest supporters, Jeff Bezos, to sour on the administration. Roughly 25% of items on Amazon come from China. In late February, Bezos announced that the opinion page of The Washington Post, which he owns, would now be dedicated to the "support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets." While many saw the move as kissing Trump's ring, Smith has a very different — and unusual — interpretation. "This was Bezos' declaration of war against Trump but not conservatism. Trump is anti-free enterprise. So if you want to be in with the business people but against Trump, you say, 'I am for free enterprise.' Just look at what the Post is publishing: They are going hard against Trump. And they are writing, 'Screw tariffs.'" (Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.) "The people that are very unhappy right now — the people who should have been the staunchest supporters in the tech world — are getting the rug pulled out from under them," Smith continues. For now, the tech industry is clinging to the hope that any economic setbacks will only be temporary. Zoë Bernard is a feature writer based in Los Angeles.

Title: Exposing the U.S.-India tech partnership: The globalist betrayal of American workers

By Amanda Bartolotta March 24, 2025 The India media is celebrating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the U.S. as a landmark moment in international relations, trade, and technological collaboration. Yet, behind the diplomatic pleasantries and ambitious promises, there are profound implications that should concern every American worker. While the official narrative describes a mutually beneficial partnership, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a powerful lobbying group with deep ties to India’s government, is revealing a different reality, one where the biggest winner is India, while the American workforce is left to bear the consequences. CII is not merely applauding this agreement; they are declaring victory. They have openly stated that this partnership will boost India’s manufacturing, attract foreign direct investment, and create jobs, in India. Missing from their extensive coverage of this visit is any substantial mention of job creation for American workers or a commitment to strengthening U.S. industry or really any benefits for America. This omission is not accidental. It is a clear indication of what this deal is truly about, cementing India’s rise as a global technology and economic powerhouse, financed in part by the American taxpayer. As I have learned through CII’s many articles and reports, this was not a sudden shift in U.S.-India relations, but rather a well-coordinated and orchestrated effort spanning over two decades, and now, it appears to be paying off exactly as intended. For years, CII has meticulously positioned India as the ideal destination for U.S. investment, offshoring, and technology partnerships, using a strategic combination of corporate influence, policy lobbying, and diaspora leverage to embed itself deep within American economic and political systems. Every report, every initiative, and every policy recommendation they have put forward has been part of a long-term playbook designed to transform India into the dominant global leader in technology, manufacturing, and trade, with U.S. wealth, jobs, and innovation fueling that rise.

This latest agreement is not just another trade deal, it is the culmination of years of calculated maneuvering that has led to India’s growing dominance in critical sectors like AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, and defense technology. While American workers have endured waves of job losses, mass layoffs, and declining wages, India has steadily positioned itself as the primary beneficiary of U.S. corporate outsourcing, workforce displacement, and technology transfers. This is not a coincidence. This is the result of a carefully executed strategy, one that CII and its network of industry insiders have worked toward for decades. And now, with this latest agreement, they are reaping the rewards of their efforts while Americans pay the price. For years, Americans have been told that China is the greatest threat to our jobs, industries, and technological leadership. While Washington remains fixated on Beijing, India has methodically positioned itself as the next major global competitor, using strategic partnerships, outsourcing, and workforce displacement to advance its own economic agenda. The difference is that while China’s rise has been met with bipartisan scrutiny, India’s expansion has been largely facilitated by U.S. policy, American investment, and corporate influence. A Closer Look at the U.S.-India Tech Agreement, Who Really Benefits? This deal is being framed as a step toward strengthening America’s technological and economic security, but the details suggest otherwise. The U.S.-India COMPACT framework and TRUST initiative focus on key industries, AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, quantum computing, and defense technology, that are not just critical to economic growth, but to national security. The question that must be asked is why the U.S. is actively helping India expand its capabilities in these fields, rather than prioritizing investment in the American workforce? The CHIPS Act, passed to revitalize semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., was designed to secure supply chains and reduce dependence on foreign production. Yet, this agreement simultaneously provides India with the means to expand its own semiconductor industry, positioning it as a direct competitor to American manufacturing. If the goal is to strengthen America’s independence in semiconductor production, why are we simultaneously bolstering another country’s ability to dominate the same industry? The agreement also paves the way for increased AI and cybersecurity collaboration, with initiatives such as the Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) and INDUS-X defense collaboration. These programs will train and develop India’s tech workforce with U.S. expertise, resources, and funding, ensuring that India’s position in the global AI and defense technology sector continues to grow. This is not a theoretical concern, India has openly stated its ambition to lead in AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, and telecommunications. With American investments and training, that ambition is quickly becoming a reality. The Impact on American Workers, More Offshoring, More Displacement \One of the most glaring concerns is what this agreement means for American jobs. The U.S. has already experienced the devastating effects of offshoring and workforce displacement through trade deals that prioritized foreign labor markets over domestic employment. This deal sets the stage for even greater job losses, particularly in technology, engineering, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. The H-1B visa program has already led to the widespread replacement of American tech workers with lower-wage foreign labor, primarily from India, the same country where our jobs, technology, and intellectual property are being aggressively offshored. Major corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been at the forefront of lobbying for more visas, enabling them to flood their U.S. workforce with Indian nationals while simultaneously cutting American jobs. At the same time, these companies are rapidly expanding their operations in India, investing billions into new tech hubs, engineering centers, and AI research labs, all while scaling back hiring in the United States. Even more concerning is the undisclosed nature of their agreements with the Indian government, which appear to secure them priority access to Indian talent both for their offshore operations and U.S.-based jobs. In other words, the same companies dictating the future of the American workforce are contractually bound to prioritize hiring from India first. But of course, what Americans can’t see won’t hurt them, or at least, not until it’s too late. This agreement is poised to expand that trend even further, creating an even larger pipeline for foreign workers while American professionals struggle to secure employment in their own industries and must I say it, our own country. Meanwhile, the $500 billion in targeted trade between the U.S. and India raises another critical question, how much of that trade will be in the form of U.S. jobs and industries being outsourced to India under the guise of “bilateral cooperation”? India’s economic growth is deeply dependent on American investment, U.S. offshoring, and the steady flow of capital from American businesses. Every time the U.S. has imposed visa restrictions or limited outsourcing, India’s GDP has suffered significantly. This is a pattern that should not be ignored. If India’s economy thrives on absorbing U.S. industries and jobs, can we really expect this partnership to create opportunities for American workers? Or are we watching yet another economic shift where U.S. corporations and policymakers facilitate the rise of a foreign competitor at the expense of American citizens? India’s Strategy, Outmaneuvering the U.S. While Washington Stays Distracted There is no denying that India has played its position masterfully. While the U.S. remains focused on countering China, India has quietly leveraged its relationships with American corporations, policymakers, and the Indian diaspora to ensure it remains a top recipient of U.S. investment, technology transfers, and workforce integration. Unlike China, whose economic policies have been met with bipartisan skepticism and trade restrictions, India has positioned itself as an indispensable partner to the U.S., despite the fact that its economic strategy mirrors many of the same practices that have led to job losses and industrial decline in America. The difference is that India has convinced U.S. leadership that this partnership is in America’s best interest, when in reality, the benefits are overwhelmingly one-sided. The Confederation of Indian Industry has been instrumental in this effort, boasting of its influence over U.S. policymakers and its ability to leverage Indian-born CEOs at major American corporations to shape policies that favor Indian workers over American citizens. This is not speculation; it is a documented strategy that has been openly discussed by CII and other organizations advocating for expanded U.S.-India trade and immigration policies. With this latest agreement, India is not just gaining economic and technological advantages, it is solidifying its position as a dominant force in the global tech economy, using U.S. resources, training, and policy support to achieve that goal. Moment of Reckoning, Will the U.S. Continue to Be Played? This agreement raises urgent questions that every American worker should demand answers to. The reality is that this is not about mutual benefit, it is about India securing its future as a global economic and technological leader, with the full support of the U.S. government and corporate elite. What I wonder is whether CII is exaggerating the extent of these deals and agreements between India and Trump to drum up more investments and interest in India’s economy, painting a picture of an unstoppable economic rise that may not even reflect the true nature of the discussions. Is this a carefully crafted sales pitch to global investors, designed to make India look like the premier destination for technology and business growth? Or is this an article not intended for American eyes, one that accidentally reveals the deeper, more detailed agreements made behind closed doors during Modi’s visit, agreements that U.S. leadership has yet to fully disclose to the American public? If the latter is true, then we must ask ourselves, what else has been quietly negotiated that we haven’t been told about? There is far more to this story than what is being reported. The deeper details, the undisclosed agreements, and the real deals made with Modi, or of the corporate elite will become clearer in time, so stay tuned! For now the question is simple. Will America’s government continue to be outmaneuvered by India? Or are American workers the ones truly being played?

ByWilliam Arruda ByWilliam Arruda , Senior Contributor. Photo credit This month, a wave of layoffs across various industries has raised concerns among professionals about job security. Major corporations, particularly in the tech sector, have announced significant workforce reductions. Siemens plans to cut over 6,000 jobs in its automation and electric vehicle (EV) charging businesses to enhance competitiveness. Similarly, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, reflecting a broader trend in the industry.​ This trend extends beyond the tech industry. Major retailers like Walgreens, CVS, and Joann Fabrics are also in the process of, or planning layoffs. Additionally, significant reductions are anticipated in various government sectors as part of Trump’s DOGE initiative. The Pentagon announced 60,000 cuts and the IRS plans to shed 45,000 jobs. Experts predict weaker employment reports and a rise in unemployment claims, citing economic uncertainty and increased automation in the workplace as key drivers. Although no one is certain that we are entering a recession, the news about widespread layoffs can be stressful. Even if you currently feel secure in your position, it’s time to acknowledge potential challenges in the job market. The best time to prepare for a job search is while you are still employed. Implementing a proactive plan can help safeguard your career and stave off anxiety.​ Focus on these 7 actions. If you haven’t worked on your personal brand in a while, it’s time to for a review. To effectively convey your value, review, update, and enhance your resume and online profiles.​ We all know that more jobs are filled through networking than job postings. Many career opportunities arise through relationships that you have built.​ Career cushioning—investing in skill development will make you a more attractive candidate for in-demand roles.​ It involves discreetly preparing for potential job loss by upskilling and networking. The bonus is that you gain essential skills that you can use in your current role. Being prepared financially is vital in uncertain times.​ Take these actions to reduce financial risk and the stress that comes from money issues. When it comes time to decide who gets put on the layoff list, make sure your manager and other decision makers see you as indispensable. Demonstrating your value within your organization will enhance job security.​ Increasing your visibility and demonstrated value positions you as a must-keep team member.​ Often, the value you build externally impacts how you’re seen inside your organization. Your online presence will influence potential employers’ perceptions, too.​ A positive online presence enhances your attractiveness to potential employers.​ While no one can fully predict what’s ahead, the wave of recent layoffs is a clear signal that professionals should stay ready, not reactive. The key to long-term career resilience is preparation. Whether or not a recession materializes, these steps will put you in a stronger position for whatever the market brings.

For startup employees wanting to rant about their bosses or run a digital reconnaissance on a company before joining it, Grapevine has been a go-to platform for the past few years, allowing it to amass a significant number of users. Now, Grapevine and other similar platforms just a few years in existence are nursing grander ambitions—to transform into a LinkedIn for startups. Grapevine, which was incorporated as Watercooler Chat Pvt. Ltd in 2023 and has raised about $2.6 million from PeakXV Partners and Riverwalk Holdings, plans to launch a job board shortly. “We want to give companies 10 good candidates every time they ask for one and do it faster than LinkedIn," said co-founder and chief executive Saumil Tripathi. That said, Grapevine hasn’t yet figured how it will monetise its job board. Medial, a networking platform for startup founders, investors and employees, is preparing to launch a marketplace for freelance or gig work. About “30% of our posts are people looking for someone to do some work for them," Medial co-founder and CEO Niket Raj Dwivedi said. This freelance marketplace will be locked behind Medial’s premium subscription plan, which costs $22 a year. Medial currently has 700 paying subscribers, who get access to a curated job board, a startup showcase, curated startups-related news, and a tracker featuring venture capital investors, government grants for startup founders, and a list of accelerator and incubator programmes. Peerlist, a platform for users to showcase their portfolios and side projects, also has a job board that charges companies $29 per listing. “We have planned a very straight path to monetisation for this year and the next," said Yogini Bende, co-founder and chief technology officer of Peerlist, which in 2023 raised $1.1 million from angel investors including Hubspot co-founder Dharmesh Shah.

For one, LinkedIn dominates the space, and recorded a 9% year-on-year growth in revenue to $392 million in the December quarter. In comparison, Medial has a monthly recurring revenue from subscribers of about ₹3 lakh, with a re-subscription rate of 70%, according to the company. Full-year financials for Grapevine, Medial and Peerlist weren’t immediately available. Also, the total addressable market for a professional networking platform focused on startup employees may not have much headroom for growth. India currently has nearly 160,000 startups, which created about 1.66 million direct jobs between 2016 and October 2024, according to the Union commerce ministry’s department of promotion of industry and internal trade. “Targeting niche networks is a better proposition than taking on large social media platforms. However, even then, you need to have 15-18% of the community actively engaging on these platforms," said Raghav Anand, partner and leader–media, digital and convergence, at EY-Parthenon. “Ability to drive multiple revenue streams and thereby a larger LTV are key to being sustainable."

These numbers fall short of Anand’s benchmark for an engaged active community that can drive multiple revenue streams, and, according to him, are also too small for advertisers to see any decent return on investment. “The bottom line here is that you either play in the 100 million userbase segment and get advertising, or if you are in the 5-8 million segment, then get subscriptions," Anand said. “But if your community is under 1 million, you need to have some very high lifetime value mechanisms."

Peerlist, which was founded in 2021, hasn’t yet spent any money on marketing, relying instead on word-of-mouth to reach new users, according to the company. “Right now, 40% of our audience comes from India and 60% from around the globe," co-founder Bende said. Grapevine, meanwhile, is expecting its user numbers to grow during the ongoing employee appraisal cycle in India, which typically stretches from March to May. “This is the time that people want to talk about their raises, but there will also be people looking to change jobs," Tripathi said.

Why Evolution Is True Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. Welcome to the end o’ the week: it’s Friday, March 21, 2025, and National French Bread Day. Here’s a well-known photo by one of my photography heroes, Henri Cartier-Bresson (you can buy the print at Amazon). The kid runs home with a necessary dinner item: It’s also National Crunchy Taco Day, International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, National California Strawberry Day, National Vermouth Day, World Poetry Day, International Day of Forests, National Flower Day, Red Nose Day in the UK, and International Tiramisu Day. For World Poetry Day, I give you “The Lake Isle of Innisfree,” by Yeats (note that it rhymes, almost an essential of good poetry): Readers are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the March 21 Wikipedia page. Da Nooz: *Heathrow Airport is near a gigantic fire that sprang up today causing a power outage, and the airport will be closed all day. Since Heathrow is a worldwide travel hub, flights all over the globe will be affected. 1300 flights have already been canceled today. Travelers braced for a day of chaos as Heathrow Airport in London was expected to remain shut all of Friday because of a power outage, grinding flights to a halt at one of the world’s busiest airports and disrupting travel across the globe. Officials at Heathrow said the airport would remain closed until 11:59 p.m. local time because of a fire nearby that caused a power outage overnight. Ed Miliband, Britain’s energy secretary, described the blaze to Sky News as a catastrophic fire that had also affected backup systems, complicating the response. Speaking to LBC radio on Friday morning, he said that “there’s no suggestion there is any foul play” having led to the fire, but that it would “take time to unwind the disruption for obvious reasons.” So far, he added, “we don’t yet have a real understanding of what caused the fire.” Around the world, people were starting to see their plans upended, and analysts said it could take several days for airlines to rebook passengers because of the large numbers.While Heathrow is the world’s fourth biggest airport in terms of total scheduled capacity, it is considered the top travel hub as the most connected airport in the world. Many travelers use it as a stepping stone to further destinations. “We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” a Heathrow representative said in a statement. *Yesterday Trump signed an EO aimed at closing the Department of Education (NYT here and WaPo here). That’s because Republican perceive the Department as an epicenter of wokeness (don’t ask me; I just work here). From the NYT: President Trump on Thursday instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency, a task that cannot be completed without congressional approval and sets the stage for a seismic political and legal battle over the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools. Surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that he said would begin dismantling the department “once and for all.” The Trump administration has cited poor test scores as a key justification for the move. “We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said. The department, which manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and supports programs for students with disabilities, was created by an act of Congress. That means, according to Article I of the Constitution, that only Congress can shut it down. That clear delineation of power, a fundamental component of democracy from the inception of the United States, underscores why no other modern president has tried to unilaterally shutter a federal department. But Mr. Trump has already taken significant steps that have limited the agency’s operations and authority. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, his administration has slashed the department’s work force by more than half and eliminated $600 million in grants. The job cuts hit particularly hard at the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the country’s guarantee that all students have an equal opportunity to an education. That movement, which includes key pro-Trump, grass-roots activists, expanded around opposition to progressive agendas that promoted mandating certain education standards and inclusive policies for L.G.B.T.Q. students. Activists contended that these policies undermined parental rights and values. But the hyper-partisanship around education issues has been present for decades, from progressive-leaning teachers’ unions who organized against President George W. Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies to conservative Republican presidential candidates in 2016 who ran against the Common Core standards elevated by President Barack Obama’s “Race to the Top” program. Divisions within the agency that were particularly affected by the layoffs include the Federal Student Aid office, the Office for Civil Rights, and the office responsible for data collection and research, data obtained by The Post shows. Most of the lawyers at the Office of General Counsel were laid off. And just days after the president signed an order declaring English the nation’s official language, nearly The WaPo notes that what the Department did will not be completely eliminated: The Education Department administers federal grant programs, including the $18.4 billion Title I program that provides supplemental funding to high-poverty K-12 schools, as well as the $15.5 billion IDEA program that helps cover the cost of education for students with disabilities. And the department oversees the $1.6 trillion federal student loan program and sets rules for what colleges must do to participate. A senior administration official said Wednesday that these programs, which make up the bulk of the Education Department’s budget and work, “will NOT be touched.” It’s not clear what that means or how the White House expects significant change without touching those programs. McMahon has said she does not support cutting federal spending on Title I or IDEA. This looks a bit harsh, though it’s generally acknowledged that teacher’s unions and schools in progressive states are uber-woke. Can’t they keep the Department but pare away the rotten bits? (And why did “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organize against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies? Weren’t those policies designed to create more equity? At any rate, the closure of the Department has to be approved by Congress. *The Free Press has a “Fight Club” article about whether Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist with a green card, should be deported. There’s both a pro and con. The “pro” is by Hussein Aboubakr Mansour, who argues for deportation on the grounds of what Khalil did, not what he said: Let me be clear: This is not a case about free speech. The heart of the problem lies not in Khalil’s words, but in his actions. He is not some wide-eyed idealist who uttered unpopular opinions or scribbled inflammatory op-eds. In fact, he served as the “negotiator” for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a student organization that gleefully cheers for “the total eradication of Western civilization.” CUAD is the primary agent of the chaos that has roiled Columbia since October 7, including assaults on janitorial workers and Jewish students. This is a determined, persistent anarchist enterprise aided by Khalil who, while enjoying the privileges of American residency, helped to spread support for terrorist organizations that have a documented history of kidnapping and killing U.S. citizens. . . . . A green card is a grant of privilege—an invitation to participate in the American project under certain mutually understood terms. The power to revoke that privilege rests with the American public through its constitutional processes precisely because we expect immigrants to respect the foundational principles of our society. If an individual devotes himself to undermining or violently dismantling our culture and institutions, that is a fundamental breach of the agreement he entered into when seeking to live here. And Eli Lake argues against deportation because, he says, this is purely an issue of speech. He thinks Khalil should be punished by Columbia, but not kicked out of the U.S.: . . . . it might surprise you that I also think the Trump administration’s effort to deport Khalil, who is a permanent legal resident of the United States, sets a horrifying precedent for free speech in America. This is because the government’s rationale for deporting him is not that he committed property crimes. It’s not that he provided material support to Hamas. Nor is it that he coordinated his or CUAD’s activities directly with Hamas. The reason Khalil is being deported is because of his speech. Here is how the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar, explained it earlier this month: “We’ve invited and allowed the student to come into the country, and he’s put himself in the middle of the process of basically pro-Palestinian activity. And at this point, like I said, the Secretary of State can review his visa process at any point and revoke it.” “Pro-Palestinian activity”? That amounts to a kind of thought crime. I agree with Lake; I think this is a free-speech issue, and green-card holders should have that right as well as American citizens. Yes, Khalil’s speech was reprehensible and abhorrent, but I have no evidence that he actually did anything illegal. Apparently, that doesn’t matter to Trump and his people, who think that Khalil endangered American security. Me, I favor free speech within First Amendment boundaries, and I can’t see that Khalil went outside those boundaries. This will be a case for the Supreme Court. *Speaking of which, the WSJ reports that people are being held up and questioned a lot more as they try to enter the U.S. than they were during the Biden administration. It even holds for those who already have visas, and even here for tourism. That’s really no surprise: Immigration officers are employing more aggressive questioning tactics with immigrants and tourists trying to enter the country, scrutinizing their visas and more frequently detaining them in a sharp break from past practice, lawyers and former immigration officials said. In a string of recent cases, border authorities have detained U.S. tourist and work visa holders for lengthy periods after seemingly minor issues with their cases. Among them: a German national with a U.S. green card, who needed to be transported to the hospital after his mother said he was strip-searched during questioning. Another, a tourist who was shackled and chained, was detained after a routine stop driving into the U.S. from Mexico. Immigrants with visa issues more often had been required to come back with additional paperwork to resolve their cases, or else put into deportation proceedings. Generally, it is rare that border authorities detain people with visa issues long-term, especially those with relatively minor violations, the lawyers and former immigration officials said. “I can’t remember anything quite that extreme,” said Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama. The moves come after an executive order, which President Trump issued on his first day in office, called on immigration officials to apply “extreme vetting” measures to visa and green card applicants, including immigrants re-entering the country. Lawyers say the directive appears to have put pressure on them to find more violators, with the goal of tightening restrictions on who is allowed into the country. This is clearly part of Trump’s promise to crack down on immigration and enforce national security. But seriously, a German with a green card has to get strip-searched? Did they have grounds for suspicion? And a tourist from Mexico put in chains and shackles? I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this. Actually, I doubt it. *I already reported that Disney’s live-people remake of “Snow White” was plagued by criticisms before it was even released, criticisms ranging from the pro-Palestinian sentiments of Rachel Zegler to the pro-Israeli sentiments of Gal Gadot, as well as the idea that the Price “stalked” Snow White and kissed her when she was unconscious. Not to mention that instead of using real dwarfs, they used computer-generated dwarfs, whereupon real dwarfs objected that their jobs were being taken away. Apoparently this attempt to clean up and update the old classic wasn’t successful. It has only a 47% critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and the AP review is also critical: That legacy of “Snow White,” by comparison, doesn’t do any favors to Marc Webb’s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this “Snow White”: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of “fair” beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time. It wouldn’t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past — a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic. But it’s a tricky thing reworking a fable that’s been around two centuries, and that’s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb’s “Snow White” has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel’s war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there’s a reason “and the Seven Dwarfs” has been stripped from the title) and the alleged “woke”-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate. I ain’t gonna see it. If real dwarfs wanted to play the dwarfs, why should they be prohibited? And I could care less about the political opinions of the actors. The important thing is whether the movie is good, watchable, and engaging, and apparently this one isn’t.

It’s reasonable to suspect she is referring to the three “stars” of Harry Potter movies, who rallied against her on trans issues https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/03/20/three-guesses-jk-rowling-appears-to-take-a-swipe-at-harry-potter-stars-amid-feud Yes, when I wrote this yesterday I truly had no idea. Then later, I suddenly thought, “It must be Emma Watson,” who has gone after JKR after Watson was in the Harry Potter movies. But I decided to leave the original so readers can guess. I think it may also be Daniel Radcliff and Rupert Grint. Hence the “three” guesses. All three of them turned on her. As I think they believed they had to in order to stay in good graces with their public. Which means they wanted to. Joke’s on them. JK is a hero and they are all but forgotten. How pathetic, what sniveling “actors” (I know no better insult). Where’d they all be without her genius? — and how have they done without her? Not well, they peaked young. Ms. Watson… who had a LOT of “pretty privilege” parlayed her fame into 5th or 7th wave feminist lunacy and maximal genderwang. She’s getting on in years now so that priv. will run out kinda soon. And the two boys…..? Not sure. Losers. Coming up many older, more talented people helped me and my career on Wall St and in the law. Even if I disagreed with them I’d never even THINK of doing what these ungrateful little turds have done to JK. At worst just shut your damn trap. Shameful little scorpions. D.A. NYC I was baffled. There is speculation in the German media that JK Rowling’s tweet is directed at Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint because all three have distanced themselves from her because of the allegedly transphobic remarks. In 2024, Rowling said she was unlikely to forgive Radcliffe and Watson for this as they are “celebrities pandering to a movement that seeks to undermine women’s hard-won rights”. Ah – missed this one. My thought also (below). Note her incisive wit – the movie is ruined. That’s what I call British. A THOUGHT FOR TODAY: Among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace. -Benito Juárez, President of Mexico (21 Mar 1806-1872) PEACE : An international affair, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting. -Ambrose Bierce The Devil’s Dictionary (1911) (I just today got an excerpt in a giant book of literature! Might have to buy a hard-copy…) Sigh… The Yates is good. I think Rowling is referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. She definitely is! The review of Disney’s new Snow White in The Times regrets that sick bags aren’t provided with each ticket and advises cinamagoers to bring their own. The reviewer notes: Equally problematic, we learn, is calling Dopey (voice by Andrew Barth Feldman) by his name. “Just because his name is Dopey doesn’t mean he’s a dope!” we are warned, like especially slow children. We are told not to laugh at Sleepy (Andy Grotelueschen) because he suffers from the chronic neurological disorder narcolepsy. The headline says it all: “Snow White review — Disney has trashed its crown jewel and its reputation”. https://archive.is/a8n1s Dopey is a subversive weed reference. Actually it’s ‘shrooms, according to The Simpsons; “If Disney sues / We’ll claim fair use / Ho Hi, Ho Hi”. Dope has been slang for injectable heroin since, like, forever, man. Its etymology goes so far back to a Dutch broth that you dip bread in, thence to cooking heroin in a spoon, with detours along the way to a resin you stiffen stretched aircraft canvas with, and to inside information about which horse in a race has been doped, that “dopey” was coined later to describe the mental state from taking dope, not the other way round. So saith Mark Forsyth of The Etymologicon. A movie that should never have been re-made. With all that budget to just do research in how a movie will land with audiences, what were they thinking? What’s next, Song of the South? I’d love to see how they “deproblematize” that one! I could not help but grin when I read the scathing review in the Times. 😆 Informative piece in the New York Post: “It’s absolutely legal to deport hate-monger Mahmoud Khalil”. PBS Newshour headed their broadcast last night with Mr. Khalil’s (long overdue, richly deserved) deportation scandal. Apparently the biggest news of the day! Followed closely by the Joos and Evil Zionists jay walking or littering somewhere, probably Gaza (which their chief newsperson learned to pronounce “properly” in Arabic lately – quite an unintentional comedic gem), thus killing billions of Palestinian babies and surgeons and puppies. What a joke those people are. D.A. NYC At the end of the Post article: ‘Khalil is a guest in our country. Guests do not have a First Amendment “right” to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or incite genocide. They do have a “right” to the first plane out of here.’ May one reasonably take it that Khalil has a right to criticize U.S. foreign policy while standing on U.S. soil, (which does not necessitate endorsing or espousing terrorist activity or inciting genocide)? Several months ago U.S. CITIZEN, U.S. Marine Corps veteran, U.N. arms inspector – and U.S. foreign policy critic – Scott Ritter tried to “take a plane out of here” but – apparently because the U.S. State Department was miffed at his exercising his First Amendment rights – instead had his passport seized, was escorted out of the airport, and soon thereafter had his home raided by the FBI, the probable cause for the warrant apparently being someone’s (contrived, fatuous) suspicion that Ritter had violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Perhaps were Ritter instead only a green card holder he might have had a better chance of “getting out of here.” I wonder if Khalil has (also) been or will be charged under FARA. Oh Filippo – I saw Ritter giving a Rah Rah speech in Chechnya in service to Russia. He gave the speech in Russian to my surprise – worse Russian than mine I was happy to note – but serviceable. No doubt as to whose side he’s on. He’s a scumbag’s scumbag – a national embarassment. And he is an unabashed traitor. Khalil can’t be a traitor as he isn’t American, he’s a foreign Islamist terrorist – so deportable. Ritter we have to endure until he takes his pro-Russia program ONE STEP too far and he can be charged for that. My popcorn is ordered. 🙂 All the best Filippo, D.A. NYC (moderate – not grand or great Russian speaker) “I wonder if the people who voted for Trump think twice when they hear about stuff like this.” No, I believe most do not. They are too buried in their media feeds which have manipulated them into believing that Russian collusion was a hoax, and that re-electing a man who already tried to overthrow our democracy once was not a concern because eggs are expensive. ‘We deported an innocent man? Someone had to sit in chains? That couldn’t be that bad. Besides, my preacher at church told me that the President is protecting the horribly oppressed Christians in this country!’ By the time these people feel the pain, it will likely be too late. The “Russian collusion” claim was found to be a hoax by R. Mueller. Let me quote from him “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”. Don’t worry it get worse. Adam Schiff promoted the “Russian collusion” hoax to the max. Not a hoax. The Russians were definitely pushing Trump. But the investigation couldn’t prove the Trump campaign was in on it. Seeing now how close Trump is to Putin now it seems suspicious. Quote: The investigation concluded in March 2019. The report concluded that the Russian Internet Research Agency’s social media campaign supported Trump’s presidential candidacy while attacking Clinton’s, and Russian intelligence hacked and released damaging material from the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations. The investigation “identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign”, and determined that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit electorally” from Russian hacking efforts. However, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? No it wasn’t. Sort of the other way around, if anything. The “no collusion” claim was a hoax perpetrated by Bill Barr. More accurately it was pretty much a straight up lie. A counterfactual meme, if you will, released into the wild by Barr. I recommend reading the Mueller Report. At least what is publicly available. For example, from volume 1, page 2 . . . “The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel’s Office found to be supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.“ . . . “In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of “collusion.” In so doing, the Office recognized that the word “collud[e]” was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation’s scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office’s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign “coordinat[ed]”—a term that appears in the appointment order—with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, “coordination” does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other’s actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. I know that’s a bit subtle, but it is pretty clear. The Mueller Report did not exonerate Trump from either collusion, which it didn’t consider at all, or even conspiracy. In fact Mueller bent over backwards to point out, perhaps too delicately, that his investigation found evidence consistent with, but not conclusive of, conspiracy. The Russian may have been promoting Trump in 2016. However, Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian. Let me offer a germane quote from J. Toobin (not exactly a Trump friendly analyst). “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? You can read the source materials or you can believe outlier opinions that fit your prior commitments. I believe that you believe that Trump was totally vindicated. If you think the Russians promoted Trump just because they thought he was a nice guy, you’re pretty naive. Let’s also remember that Clinton campaign money was funneled to at least one Russian national in exchange for fabricated dirt on Trump. Dems were actually doing what they claimed Trump was doing—colluding with Russians to influence the election. Even if that were true, who cares? Weren’t we taught in grade school that two wrongs don’t make a right? In any case, that characterization is not much different from being completely false. You did not quote from the report. You must have typed it from memory. The real quote is “In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.” Not a hoax. The report clearly established Russian election interference. Lots of links from the Russian side. Just not enough evidence that during those discussions (e.g. calls between Flynn and Kislyak, Oknyansky met with Roger Stone, Konstantin Kilimnik working for Paul Manafort ‘assessed by the FBI to have ties to Russian intelligence, Michael Cohen “emailed the Kremlin requesting to speak to (Sergei) Ivanov”, and lots more) that anyone from the Campaign ‘coordinated or conspired’. “Certainly the most important thing is the total vindication of the president and his staff on the issue of collusion. There’s just no way around that,” Toobin said on CNN.” What does “total vindication” means to you? Other sources (MSNBC, the Guardian, Rachel Maddow, etc.) all agree that the Trump/Russia claims were a hoax. Should I quote from them? The hoax was exposed and Trump was cleared. You could try quoting from the Mueller report. But you don’t. Your arguments are the epitome of the word facile. I don’t use the word often, but I love the instance where it stands alone. You made a similar remark yesterday talking about Alito and Thomas corruption; you left a comment that “accepting a gift isn’t a crime” another example of your facile bullshit. The word applies to Trump as well, and his explanations for his actions are somehow beyond facile. WEIT has a lot of MAGAs nowadays…it’s sort of depressing, I must confess. “You did not quote from the report”. I literally quoted from the report. “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” is at the top of page 2 of the report (look for the “Introduction to Volume I”). I apologize for confusing two sentences from the Mueller report. I had quoted from page 173. The partial sentence was almost identical and I thought you had added the word ‘Trump’ that was missing from the one on page 173. My unintentional error, which was partly due to search in Adobe. Your quote was, however missing the beginning of the sentence (either on page 2 or 173), which means you quote-mined and ignored the context. To be an accurate partial quote, you must add ‘…’ to the quote. You capitalized ‘The’ instead. I acknowledge the capitalization may have been auto-corrected. But you ignored the first two phrases “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,” in the sentence you claim to be quoting. Because in my opinion, it clearly contradicts your intended point. I don’t care what Toobin said, Trump was not ‘totally vindicated’. Russian definitely interfered with the election. Trump called for them to do so in public. Mueller didn’t have wiretaps or recordings of what was actually said in those numerous communications and meetings. I can agree that Mueller was unable to demonstrate collusion beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore did not formerly charge Trump or the campaign (there were other reasons for no formal charges as well). To compare, OJ Simpson was found not guilty, but he was not totally vindicated either. Border guards have very broad powers everywhere. All travellers ought to know this. Harsh vetting gets amplified in the news when the government is controversial. I wouldn’t think ordinary citizens would have much issue with non-citizens being scrutinized closely or harshly. Why should it bother them? Even Canadian citizens returning home to Canada may experience “extreme vetting” if the Border Services Agency personnel suspect they are carrying contraband or have been up to no good while abroad. They don’t need probable cause. They can search everyone in the queue if they want to, and anything they find is admissible as evidence. The Border agents can demand you open your phone for them. If you refuse they will seize it and leave you to worry for the rest of your days that someday our spooks will crack it and tell the Mounties what they found. The body packers having swallowed condoms filled with dope are in for a particularly hard time. We’re not talking one or two. We’re talking dozens. And if one breaks, smuggler is def going to hospital. So you’d want to hear the whole story about the poor German before rushing to judgment. Every Canadian has heard horror stories of retuning citizens having their cars taken apart in the parking lot outside the Customs shack. And these are Canadian citizens, whose right to enter Canada is not contestable. If you don’t have a right to enter (because you’re not a citizen), it’s on you to convince the border agent that you’re going to be worth the risk. Crossing borders is always a bit of a crap shoot, as is travel generally. Visa-free crossing between the U.S. and Canada for each other’s citizens is about as good as it gets but it still goes wrong sometimes, especially after 9/11. I have a funny (really) story about this. I once tried to enter Canada and was held up (at the border) for at least 30 minutes. The Canadian border agents checked my background in every state that I had ever lived in. They had reason to do so. I told the Canadian border agents a story that they knew was not true (I said I was going to Canada to get dinner). They knew that there were no restaurants on the Canadian side of the border. They assumed that I was smuggling guns or drugs (which was not true, I thought that there were restaurants on the Canadian side of the border). Eventually they let me into Canada. I never found any restaurants. It turns out, that I was trying to enter one of the poorest parts of Canada. The U.S. Dept of Ed is really a mixed bag at best. K-12 education in the U.S. is the responsibility of the states and each state is very possessive regarding its authority. So there has always been a pretty large variation in curriculum content between states. Even within states, there was large variation as localities could pretty much roll their own curriculum until the National Governors’ Association (NGA) in the late 80’s asked non-profit, Achieve, Inc, to develop a set of expected curriculum content standards in English Language Arts and math that was internationally normed and could be used as guidance for each of the states. Participation in the resulting standards was a voluntary committment of a state. I believe these standards were later expanded into the Obama Common Core and some money was attached to sweeten the pot for states who participated in that. The NGA also had Achieve, Inc develop the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) published in 2013 which, among other things, rolled engineering design, previously considered to be vocational education in K12, into science preparation. Again participation was voluntary and this was not a U.S. Dept of Education initiative. Some of you may recall PSSC physics or BSCS biology. Neither was a federal initiative, but rather came from university professors who coopted some high school teachers to develop some 20th century science content and textbooks to replace the extant late 19th century content of the 1893 Committee of Ten report under which almost all states still operated into the 1960’s and 70’s. The Advanced Placement (AP) courses came from the College Boards, not the U.S. Dept of Education. What the U.S. Dept of Education does do well is assure that all states support civil rights of all children to participate in education across all states. Thus the various Titled funding and enforcement. But the vast majority of K-12 funding and all curriculum content requirements come from individual states and localities, not the federal government and certainly not the U.S. Dept of Education. On our latest club terrorist: “and green-card holders should have that right (of unfettered free speech) as well as American citizens.” writes WEIT. Maybe they should! Good arguments for exactly that abound. But they don’t. So it is goodbye to Khalil. D.A. NYC *ps Maybe while being deported he’ll be able to pick up some lighter fluid duty free for burning American flags (or humans) at his next stop? Which should be Algeria. There’s debate as to his actual citizenship – details fuzzy as always with terrorists – but seems to be Algeria. I hope it is, few places are worse to be returned to than Algeria. (My thesis studying Middle East politics at Georgetown was about fundamentalism in Algeria and Iran. Trust me – Algeria is not a fun place.) David, I really like the expression “club terrorist” and would like to use it. They actually do, though, don’t they David? A non-citizen alien can’t be charged with a speech crime and fined or jailed because such a speech crime law would itself violate the First Amendment no matter who was charged with breaking it. It’s the law that would fail, irrespective of the status of the person charged under it. Everyone has a right not to be punished for speech in the United States because no law abridging it can be upheld as enforceable even before the first person was charged under it. Anti-Semitic speech is either illegal or it’s not (and it’s almost always not), no matter who utters it. There is no special provision in what laws you do have restricting speech, like libel, incitement, etc., that says it’s legal for citizens to say it but not for aliens. Besides, the Government doesn’t even want to charge Mr. Whatzizname with a crime, with a goal to put him in jail. It just wants to deport him as an undesirable. That’s an administrative process subject to judicial review, not a 1A issue at all. Deportation to Algeria can’t be construed as a punishment. Algeria is not an American penal colony like Guantanamo Bay. It’s a sovereign country with citizens living in it. Once he’s off the plane in Algeria, U.S., law no longer applies to him. He’s a free man. It would only become a 1A issue if the Supreme Court discovered some Constitutional right buried in immigration law that said the (Green-card in this case) alien can’t be deported unless convicted of an actual crime. Then to make deportation stick, the Government would have to first find him guilty of a crime. The only speech crimes that exist are those that apply to everyone (e.g., libel or incitement.) I think we all agree he hasn’t committed any of those. So the Government would have to find something else to charge him with. But I don’t see the Supreme Court wanting to so restrict the power of the Executive to deport aliens. No one who strays into the U.S. from Canada or who is picked up in a sweep has (yet) been convicted of the crime of entering the U.S. illegally. ICE still proceeds with deporting them forthwith unless they claim asylum. They don’t get to stay until found guilty in Court. The beauty of deportation is that it’s an administrative function of the Executive, like the granting or revoking of a motor vehicle registration. If you don’t pay your registration fee and you try to take your unregistered motor vehicle onto the road, the police will impound it. They don’t need to convict you of a crime to hold onto your car in the pound until you come to tow it home. But they can’t fine you unless they charge you with operating an unregistered vehicle (which they will) and they can’t collect the fine until you plead, or are found, guilty. The CGI dwarves in the new Snow White were not the first choice. My understanding is that they originally began filming with seven ordinary-sized actors of various races, sexes, and shapes, with funny clothes and hair. Presumably the idea was to update the dwarves into magical creatures of the forest. When photos and some film got out it was immediately mocked as “Snow White and the Seven Diversity Hires.” It looked pretty ridiculous. People were outraged and Disney backed off, coming up with the idea of using CGI. I suspect the original non-dwarf cast cemented the idea that this version was “woke.” It must have been pretty frustrating to be an actor getting your first big break playing what you hoped would be a well-loved Disney character in a major motion picture, only to be replaced by a really good cartoon. The “Seven Diversity Hires” are still in the film. Now they form a band of robbers who support Snow Whites love interest, the prince gang leader “Robin Hood” Jonathan. I’ve seen the film referred to as “Off-white and the Seven Diversity Hires”, too. +1 HAHHA. Again… killer JezGrove. Or… Snowy-ish and the DEIs. hahhaa D.A. NYC Ceiling Cat: Here is an open letter that may interest you. I’ve signed, as have leaders of CAFH. “Open letter in response to federal funding cuts at Columbia”: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQ9_FL9psAwt-QohkPZo2BVa5sxj5QSJL44DSFYwYE0/edit?tab=t.0 One of the first actions authoritarians do is to bend institutions to their will or simply destroy them: media, universities, institutions within the government, etc. The Columbia actions are a small part of these efforts. They also understand how easy it is to destroy an institution (USAID comes to mind) than to build one. An institution that has been a part of the US soft power infrastructure since the 60’s was destroyed with a couple key strokes. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a historian and an expert on authoritarians, how they take power and transform governments. If you want to understand exactly what the Trump administration is doing, I’d suggest following her. Thank you for your reply, Mark. I’ll admit, I’m torn. On one hand, I’m deeply troubled by the infiltration of our institutions by actors who promote the interests of foreign powers. Qatar’s funding of universities, for example, has enabled a great deal of soft power and influence that shapes academic priorities and public discourse in concerning ways. I voted for the “Orange Beast” because I believe that Harris and the current Democratic Party no longer represent the interests of the working class—or the ideals the party once stood for. In my view, they’ve drifted too far, increasingly catering to Iran and enabling narratives that undermine core American values. At the same time, I’m not blind to the threat posed by Putin’s influence. However, after the orchestrated psyops and misinformation campaigns waged by the CIA and certain Democratic factions—particularly regarding “Russian disinformation”—I find it difficult to trust anything emerging from those sources. It’s hard to discern what’s real when so much of the discourse feels manipulated. Perhaps Trump’s personality—his ego and bluster—makes him susceptible to Putin’s manipulation. Or perhaps, despite appearances, he is uniquely positioned to counter Iran’s aggression while keeping Putin in check. I hope the latter is true, though nearly every Democrat I know parrots the former narrative without much critical thought. What concerns me most is the sense that Putin and China are sitting back with popcorn in hand, watching how effortlessly our universities and federal institutions have been radicalized by ideologies hostile to the West. It’s disheartening to witness, and I wonder how far they’ll be able to exploit this ideological capture. That said, I don’t buy into the “Trump is a dictator” hysteria. The more I hear that refrain, the more it reinforces my sympathy for him—if only because the arguments tend to be so hyperbolic and unconvincing. For all that, I remain opposed to Trump’s cuts to university funding. I’ve made that clear, both by signing the Open Letter and in conversations on a Harvard listserv. Defunding biomedical research as a reaction to campus politics is a miscalculation. It’s shortsighted to jeopardize life-saving research in the name of fighting “wokeness” or antisemitism, even though wokeness and antisemitism are very real problems. It’s just that Trump bulldozing academia won’t solve either. When it comes to slashing federal programs like USAID, I have fewer qualms. Agencies like that are bloated, often corrupt, and long overdue for a reckoning. But targeting universities? That’s a misfire. We shouldn’t sacrifice life-saving biomedical research to make a point about campus politics. There’s a world of difference between trimming the fat in Washington and gutting our research institutions. I only wish Trump had drawn that line. At the same time, universities are to blame that DOGE and the public can’t tell the difference between woke, intersectional, DEI nonsense and research that quacks like that but saves lives. Update on Columbia: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/21/metro/columbia-grants-trump-demands/?event=event25 I asked an AI bot to rename the Seven Dwarfs as woke characters. Part of its response was This exercise highlights the complexities of “woke” reimaginings. It’s a conversation about representation and inclusivity, but it also requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences. That’s the problem right there. Even after careful consideration (and does that happen?) unforseen consequences will abound. Sounds like Google Gemini. Very anxious not to offend. You might get better results from ChatGPT or Grok. There is a public garden called Innisfree in Millbrook, NY. It is only open W-Su from 10-5 from late April through mid-Oct. You need a car to get there. It is 4 mi. east of the Taconic Pkwy, or a bit NE of Poughkeepsie, NY. Admin is $10 ($5 seniors & kids). It is a lovely, peaceful, informal garden with a large lake and trails that wander between ‘cup’ gardens. I highly recommend a visit if you are ever in the area at the right time. You can see some images here: https://www.innisfreegarden.org/gardenareas With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Re why “progressive-leaning teachers’ unions” organised against Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policies which were designed to create more equity — Partly because they could easily have imagined a likely result: the most (only?) feasible way to directly reduce existing gaps between high and low achievers is to reduce the standards, thus everyone becomes a high achiever, thus equity. The pressure on states and schools to reduce the gaps did indeed result in exactly that. And IMO there’s no way that Bush’s admin didn’t anticipate this; one can reasonably speculate that they would consider this a feature not a bug, since it would reduce support for public education. Say what you will about the Republican party, but it’s hard to disagree that they tend to run a longer con than the Democrats do. Not remotely 3-D chess, but much more than gut-reaction whining and performative outrage. Roe’s gone, proof of your pudding… With the Snow White remake, I think they were forced to ‘reimagine’ the dwarf part of the story after Peter Dinklage criticized the notion of a bunch of dwarves living together in a cave. Peter Dinklage being a famous dwarf actor from Game of Thrones. Before I became acquainted with “Innisfree” as a written poem, I knew it from this setting as sung by Judy Collins. https://youtu.be/QahVf0wL9IU?si=kVI4tBrTQv7sWbc6 (I long thought she had composed the music, but later learned the setting was around and she picked it and sang it. It was not, however, a strange idea that she might have written the music — though not usually listed with the singer/songwriters, she did write several of the songs she sings. I have looked up who the composer was, but don’t remember. Oh, and there is another, entirely distinct, setting by somebody else.) Edit: It appears to be Hamilton Camp.

Title: 'Do not celebrate too early....': Thyrocare founder warns jobseekers amid layoffs at Amazon

Feedback Thyrocare founder Dr A Velumani has weighed in on the emotional toll of mass layoffs. In a post on X, Velumani reflected on how early career wins at big tech firms often lead to disappointment when job cuts strike unexpectedly. “Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200. 1000 or 2000. 14000. Do not celebrate too early. Career or business – It's Marathon Race,” Dr A Velumani posted on X. His remarks quickly gained traction, triggering widespread discussion online about job security and long-term career planning. Several users echoed the sentiment, pointing out the need for adaptability in a volatile job market. “Job security is a myth. Skills, adaptability, and financial planning matter more than titles,” one user wrote. Another added, “Reminds me of the funda that never get too comfortable too soon. Whether career or business, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Stay adaptable, keep growing.” A third commented, “In other way, don't give-up early, it's a marathon race. Situations may change anytime.” Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200 1000 or 2000 14000!!!! Donot celebrate too early. Career or business - It’s Marathon Race. pic.twitter.com/rrcQujB7hN Other users took a broader view of professional growth. “A job is a sprint, but wealth-building is a marathon. Markets, careers, and businesses have cycles—ups and downs are inevitable. Invest like you build a career—steady, patient, and focused on the long run,” one user noted. There were also reflections on the realities of the corporate world. “Everything has a shelf life like a product. Human beings needs to evolve from being commodity to VA product. Orgs have to save their ass when times are bad. Learn this at young age,” said one response. Referencing Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, another user remarked, “As Kalam sir said no need to be loyal to the company, be loyal to your work.” Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.
