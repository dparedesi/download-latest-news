Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Product sales were strong, but third-party seller services, advertising and subscriptions grew by double digits in the period. Spurred in part by its summertime Prime Day sale, Amazon on Thursday reported that Q3 online store sales rose 7.2% year over year to $61.4 billion and physical-store sales rose 5.4% to $5.2 billion. Growth of services in the e-commerce giant’s retail business was especially solid. Product sales grew 7% to $67.6 billion, while third-party seller services rose 10.3% to $37.9 billion, advertising grew 18.8% to $14.3 billion and subscriptions grew 10.9% to $11.3 billion. The giant AWS cloud services business, which underpins Amazon’s profitability, helped drive net income growth of more than 55% to $15.3 billion, per a company press release. Several analysts took note of the robust operating margins in Amazon’s Q3 report. At Amazon’s cloud unit, which is benefiting from AI and all its potential, operating margin topped 38%. But, while AWS and its international segment posted all-time highs in that metric, there were strong operating margins across the company’s business segments in the third quarter, according to research from William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden. Operating margins were also given a boost by Amazon’s layoffs in recent years. Though most cuts were made about a year ago, workforce reductions continued into this year, including at AWS and in customer service, warehouse operations and Buy with Prime. Based on their job postings monitor, UBS analysts deem the margin upside from a leaner headcount “durable,” according to a Friday client note. There were also other strengths in retail. For example, the 7% product-sales expansion was the best growth in six months, boosted by summer’s Prime Day, according to emailed comments from GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. “This is always a big event for Amazon but, despite even tougher competition from other retailers jumping aboard the discount bandwagon, Amazon remained the focal point and pulled in more shoppers than ever,” he said. “Some of this is down to consumers being more receptive to discounts, but some is also because Amazon has fine-tuned the deals it offers to ensure they are relevant and compelling. This aids conversion.” The company’s Prime membership “remains a core contributor to this growth,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts Thursday, noting that Prime Day boosted paid membership growth, which accelerated in the U.S. and abroad in Q3. While AI is critical to the progress at AWS, Amazon also touted AI-powered initiatives in retail, including shopping tool Rufus, which rolled out to U.S. customers earlier this year and is becoming available in Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and the U.K.; shopping guides that simplify product search; Project Amelia, an AI assistant for sellers; and video generation and live image capabilities for advertisers. Perhaps even more important to Amazon’s retail operation is its refinements in fulfillment and delivery, increasingly aided by robotics. Improved inventory placement in Q3 helped drive down costs in the company’s fulfillment network, which led to “better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box,” Olsavsky said. “The reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us ... to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today,” he said, noting that in a new Shreveport, Louisiana, facility the company now has “very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow.” In retail, Amazon is also benefiting somewhat from “some of the slip-ups of other retailers in more essential categories, such as locking up products or deteriorating the store experience,” according to Saunders. Customer service, curation and other aspects of a good store experience are crucial to insulating retailers from the stiff competition from Amazon, experts say. That’s true not just of specialty retail but also everyday goods, Saunders said. “While it is only happening at the margins, these things are pushing more people to shop for everyday products on Amazon — with many of these new converts becoming regular and loyal customers in essentials categories,” he said.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Alphabet executives, donning Halloween costumes, faced questions from concerned employees at an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, following comments on the company’s earnings call suggesting that more cost cuts are coming. “There is a reality to it,” said Brian Ong, vice president of Google recruiting, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by CNBC. “We are hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” Ong, who was specifically responding to a question about retention and promotion opportunities, added that fewer positions are open and geographic hiring has changed, “so you may see fewer roles available where you are.” A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The meeting came after Alphabet reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue Tuesday, sparking a rally in the stock. On a call with investors, CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who recently succeeded Ruth Porat, proclaimed she wanted to “push a little further” with cost savings across the company. Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wore a starfish costume to the meeting, while Ashkenazi sported a jersey of former Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller. CEO Sundar Pichai wore a black t-shirt that read “ERROR 404 COSTUME NOT FOUND” with an image of a pixelated dinosaur. Ashkenazi said one of her key priorities in the new role would be to make more cuts as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2025. It’s a theme that began in 2023, when the economy and market turned, and has continued since. Google has been restructuring its workforce to move more quickly in the AI arms race, where it faces increased competition. That’s included layoffs, organizational shake-ups, and has led to workers feeling a “decline in morale,” as CNBC previously reported. Over the last couple of months, Google has made cuts to its marketing, cloud and security teams in Silicon Valley, as well as in its trust and safety unit. Google is far from alone. Dropbox this week announced it will lay off 20% of its global workforce, while Amazon continues shuttering various projects. Within Google, employees have expressed concern that the company is preparing for more layoffs, possibly after the end of the year, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Pichai joked that the quarterly call was perfect preparation for Ashkenazi ahead of the company meeting. “I was telling Anat yesterday, earnings calls are a piece of cake compared to TGIF the next day,” Pichai said, to laughs from attendees. Some employee comments and questions included praise for “another great quarter,” success in chip advancements and improvements in Google’s hit AI note-taking tool NotebookLM. However, other questions expressed fear of what greater cost efficiencies would mean for the workforce. “What exactly was meant by the comments on further efficiencies in headcount”? one question asked, pointing to Ashkenazi’s comments from the call. Ashkenazi didn’t share any more details but said employees are “one of the most important assets we have.” She said that the company is investing in people and that it hired 1,000 new graduates in the third quarter. Pichai, who’s been preaching efficiency for almost two years, chimed in to echo past sentiment. “If you have to do something new and it’s going to take 10 people, if you can find a way to do it with eight people by making smart trade-offs somewhere and aligning teams better, that’s an example of finding efficiencies in headcount as well,” Pichai said. In response to another question about ongoing layoffs and reorganizations and what might be coming in the future, Pichai said, “If we are making companywide decisions, we’ll definitely let you know.” He said the company is spending heavily on AI at the moment, but the need to ramp up those expenses won’t last forever. “We are going through an extraordinary period of capex advancement,” Pichai said. “When you have these technology shifts, at the earlier stages, you invest disproportionately and then the curve gets better and that’s the transition as an industry we are working through.” He added that not all of the cuts are decided on by top executives. “It’s not like all of these decisions are centrally done at a company level,” he said. “And so, at the scale of our company, there could be moments where there are small groups of people impacted.” Ashkenazi on Tuesday mentioned that one way to get more cost efficiency is by using AI internally. The company said 25% of new code is now generated by AI. In response to a question about productivity, Brian Saluzzo, head of “Core” developers, said that while the 25% refers to low-level tasks, leadership is in the midst of “expanding to more complex areas” within the company. “Core” refers to the teams that build the technical foundation underlying Google’s flagship products. In May, CNBC reported that Google laid off more than 200 employees from its Core engineering teams, in a reorganization that included rehiring some roles in India and Mexico. Pichai followed up by saying, “In this transition moment, across all functions, everywhere in the company, it’s worth challenging us to think where we can use AI to be more productive.” He added that through 2025, the workforce should “strive to do more” and “help customers around the world take those learnings as well.” Jennifer covers Google parent company Alphabet Inc. and Silicon Valley culture for CNBC.com in San Francisco. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Report: Big Media Companies Are Increasing Their Spending On Content

According to a report from Ampere Analytics, over half of all content spending in 2024 will come ... [+] from six companies. Disney leads in total content investments. Netflix ranks first with spending on streaming content. Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Earlier this week, Ampere Analytics, a U.K.-based research and analytics company focusing on media and content released its latest report on content spending. Among the key findings was the combined spending of six companies; Disney, Comcast, Google (YouTube), Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and Paramount Global content spend will total $126 billion in 2024, a year-over-year increase of +9%. In a first, the six companies will now account for over half (50.6%) of total content spending. By comparison, last year, the six companies accounted for 47.5% of content spend. With reports the era of Peak TV, which saw a steady increase in the number of original scripted programming had peaked; Ampere reports that since 2022 spending on original content from the six companies had totaled $56 billion, accounting for 45% of total spending. Peter Ingram, research manager at Ampere Analysis said, “We can expect that the content landscape will see low-level growth in 2024 as production schedules recover from disruptions caused by the pandemic and the writers’ and actors’ union strikes.” Ingram added, “Looking forward however, overall growth in spend is set to plateau as companies look to refocus their output. This will include limiting commissioning volumes and prioritizing strategic investments and profitability to counter the current challenges of the media market.” Ampere found as viewers migrate away from linear television that content companies are investing more on their streaming platforms. This year $40 billion will be invested on streaming including content from Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of the total spend. Among the six companies Disney is the top spender on global content. In 2024 Disney is expected to spend $35.8 billion accounting for 14.4% of the total. Earlier this year, Disney’s attained total ownership of Hulu after negotiations with Comcast were finalized. The addition of Hulu added an estimated $9 billion in content spend. Furthermore, Disney continues to be the largest provider of television and film content worldwide accounting for 14% of the total. For the year, Comcast ranked second in content spend at $24.5 billion (9.9% of total spend) Google ranked third at $17.6 billion 7.1%), followed by Warner Bros. Discovery at $16.8 billion (6.8%). In a reversal from last year, Netflix will now rank fifth with $16.0 billion (6.4%) surpassing Paramount Global at $15.1 billion (6.1%). Ampere noted that Paramount’s investment in original; content has slowed this year. In addition, non-U.S. original content will account for 40% of Paramount+ and 52% for Netflix. Production costs outside the U.S. tend to be lower. Earlier in the year Ampere reported Netflix and Amazon over a full quarter had ordered more than half of their titles from outside the U.S. Ampere noted since the pandemic, Netflix has become the leading content spender among streaming platforms with an average investment of $14.5 billion per annum. The dollars are expected to increase as Netflix has invested in live sports. Starting this year through 2026, Netflix will be live streaming an NFL Christmas Day doubleheader. Also, next year, Netflix will become the new home of WWE Raw. The report noted that Google’s content investment is derived from YouTube and investment in programming via their revenue-sharing arrangements with content creators. While different from other content investors, the streaming platform has been building a strong presence globally in agreements with major content providers. As a result, YouTube has emerged as the third largest content spender. The increase in content spending comes at a time when several streaming services launched during the pandemic are starting to become profitable or at least have cut their losses. The increase in content spending also coincides at a time when several media companies, looking to cut their losses, have been cutting back on other units including a series of personnel layoffs.

Title: Stock market today: Microsoft, Meta and the burden of expectations knock Wall Street sharply lower

Drops for Big Tech companies including Microsoft and Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms led Wall Street lower NEW YORK -- The downside of high expectations thumped Wall Street on Thursday, and Microsoft and Meta Platforms dragged U.S. stock indexes lower despite delivering strong profits for the summer. The S&P 500 sank 1.9% for its worst day in eight weeks and fell further from its record set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 378 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% for a second straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. Microsoft reported bigger profit growth for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped forecasts, but its stock nevertheless sank 6% as investors and analysts scoured for possible disappointments. Many centered on Microsoft’s estimate for upcoming growth in its Azure cloud-computing business, which fell short of some analysts’ expectations. The parent company of Facebook, meanwhile, likewise served up a better-than-expected profit report. As with Microsoft, that wasn’t enough to boost its stock. Investors focused instead on Meta Platforms’ warning that it expects a “significant acceleration” in spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing artificial intelligence. It fell 4.1%. Both Microsoft and Meta Platforms have soared in recent years amid a frenzy around AI, and they’re entrenched among Wall Street’s most influential stocks. But such stellar performances have critics saying their stock prices have simply climbed too fast, leaving them too expensive. It’s difficult to meet everyone’s expectations when they’re so high, and Microsoft and Meta were both among Thursday’s heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Amazon and Apple also helped drag the market lower, with Amazon falling 3.4% and Apple dropping 2% before they released their profit reports after trading ended for the day. They’re the latest companies in the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to do so. Earlier this month, Tesla and Alphabet kicked off the Magnificent Seven’s reports with results that investors found impressive enough to reward with higher stock prices. The lone remaining member, Nvidia, will report its results later this earnings season, and its 4.8% drop was Thursday’s heaviest weight on the market after Microsoft. Expectations are just as high for the chip company after its stock soared over 880% in the last two years. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the last six, even though it set an all-time high during the middle of it. Such a big move might have been overdue following an unusually long and placid run, according to Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. He pointed to how the S&P 500 had failed to move by 1% in a day in either direction, without accounting for rounding, for the longest stretch in nearly three years. Still, Thursday wasn’t a complete washout thanks in part to cruise ships and cigarettes. Norwegian Cruise Line Holding steamed 6.3% higher after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cruise ship operator said it was seeing strong demand from customers across its brands and itineraries, and it raised its profit forecast for the full year of 2024. Altria Group rose 7.8% for another one of the S&P 500’s bigger gains after beating analysts’ profit expectations. Chief Executive Billy Gifford credited resilience for its Marlboro brand, among other things, and announced a cost-cutting initiative. Oil-and-gas companies also rose after the price of a barrel of U.S. crude gained 0.9% to recoup some of its losses for the week and for the year so far. ConocoPhillips jumped 6.4%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 108.22 points to 5,705.45. The Dow dropped 378.08 to 41,736.46, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 512.78 to 18,095.15. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends after ignoring food and energy costs were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields swiveled up and down several times following the reports before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of last month. Yields have been rising following a string of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. Such data bolster hopes that the economy can avoid a recession, particularly now that the Fed is cutting interest rates to support the job market instead of keeping them high to quash high inflation. But the surprising resilience is also forcing traders to downgrade their expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes sank across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.5% for one of the larger losses after North Korea test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to hit the U.S. mainland in a move that was likely meant to grab America’s attention ahead of Election Day. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech’s latest earnings show the AI spending spree isn’t over

Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…Big Tech is increasing AI spending… OpenAI drops its foundry ambitions… Wall Street boosts AI infrastructure… and AI models give inaccurate voting info. Quarterly earnings are in for Microsoft, Meta, and Google, with Amazon’s on the way tonight. Those who reported so far made one thing clear: They’re about to amp up spending on AI even more. Of course, most of this investment will go to infrastructure like Nvidia chips and data centers. Nvidia isn’t set to announce its Q3 earnings for another month, but it will be another telling one to watch for the pulse on the AI boom. Meta said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 as it accelerates its infrastructure investments. The company raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion. “Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call yesterday. Meta is currently working on the next version of its Llama model and is continuing to position itself as an AI company—all while relying on ad revenue from its social media platforms to foot the bill. To bridge the gap, Zuckerberg framed AI as a win for its core ad business. He said its advancements in AI are making it possible to better predict what content users want to see, leading to 8% and 6% increases in time spent on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Microsoft posted positive growth for its AI business, reporting that it’s on track to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue run rate in the current quarter and will be its fastest product category to reach that milestone yet. Additionally, the company disclosed details of its investment in OpenAI for the first time in a quarterly regulatory filing, painting a picture of massive losses on the other side of its AI bet. In the filing, Microsoft stated it’s made $13 billion in total commitments to OpenAI. This, however, didn’t include the additional $750 million the company reportedly invested in OpenAI’s latest funding round at the beginning of October (the filing quarter ended Sept. 30). Besides its overall investment, Microsoft also disclosed the toll its bankrolling of OpenAI is taking on its profits. The company said that losses from its stake in OpenAI were part of the reason it had a $683 million expense on its equity investments for the quarter. On AI, Google touted how the boom has boosted its cloud business. But even more interestingly, CEO Sundar Pichai said AI is writing over 25% of new code at the company, but engineers still review the work before using it. While the rest of the AI-related earnings statements from the companies were somewhat predictable, I would’ve loved to hear more detail about the programming by AI.

Reuters reported that OpenAI has dropped its ambitions to create its own foundries—the name for factories that produce semiconductors—due to the immense cost and time that would be required. Instead, OpenAI has been working with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference for several months and, through Broadcom, has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The AI firm plans to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026, but sources told Reuters the timeline may change. OpenAI is also tapping commercially available chips from AMD, further rounding out its plan to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. AI power and data center projects get a $50 billion boost from Wall Street. Investment giant KKR and private equity group Energy Capital Partners are working together with tech companies to accelerate their access to electricity required for AI and will make a combined $50 billion in investments over the next four years. Doug Kimmelman, founder and senior partner at Energy Capital Partners, told the Wall Street Journal that “[natural] gas is going to be at the forefront of this.” The insatiable energy demands of AI continue to be one of the largest issues with the technology. Over the last several weeks, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all announced investments in nuclear energy as they search for a more environmentally-friendly way to power their AI. AI designed to identify people who need help paying their water bill offers big discount to one of the city’s richest customers instead. The water bureau of Portland, Ore., piloted a machine learning algorithm designed to predict customers' ability to pay and then offer discounts to those who are struggling. One of the first customers the algorithm targeted, however, was Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle, who said he received notice he was being given a 40% discount even though he has no trouble paying his water bill. Boyle earned more than $1.6 million last year and holds Columbia shares worth more than $1.7 billion. “I don’t want the discount—they should give it to somebody who needs it,” Boyle told local news outlet Willamette Weekly. The Portland Water Bureau approved $350,000 for the contract for the pilot with contractor SERVUS.

The stock was up about 7% on Friday morning. Here are the results. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report: In cloud, Amazon Web Services revenue was a hair below consensus estimates, but it's growing faster than the same period last year. Sales grew 19% during the quarter compared to a year ago when sales accelerated by 12%. The company was navigating slowing growth in its cloud business last year as customers trimmed their budgets due to heightened economic concerns. AWS is still growing at a slower rate than its top challengers. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services at Microsoft came in at 33%, and Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased nearly 35%. Amazon's capital expenditures surged 81% year-over-year from $12.48 billion to $22.62 billion as it continues to invest in data centers and equipment like Nvidia GPUs to power its artificial intelligence products. Amazon has launched several AI products in its cloud and e-commerce businesses, and it's also expected to announce a new version of its Alexa voice assistant powered by generative AI. The company's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call that the majority of the company's 2024 capex spending is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company plans to spend about $75 billion on capex in 2024 and that he suspects the company will spend more in 2025. "The increase bumps here are really driven by generative AI," Jassy said during a call with analysts. "It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity," he said, noting that shareholders "will feel good about this long term, that we're aggressively pursuing it." Advertising was another bright spot in the report. Sales in the unit expanded 19% year over year to $14.3 billion during the quarter, outpacing growth in Amazon's core retail business. Amazon and Apple, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, round out a busy week of earnings for the top tech companies. Alphabet on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results, driven by cloud growth. Microsoft issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, leading to the stock's steepest selloff in two years, while Meta beat estimates but warned of significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses next year. Among online ad companies, Amazon showed the strongest growth, although its ad business still remains a fraction the size of juggernauts Meta and Google. Meta's advertising revenue grew 18.7% year over year, while Google's advertising business increased 15% in the quarter. Snap's sales jumped 15% from a year earlier. Amazon forecast revenue in the current quarter to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, which would represent growth of 7% to 11% year over year. The midpoint of that range, $185 billion, fell short of the average analyst estimate of $186.2 billion, according to LSEG. Operating income during the third quarter grew 56% year over year to $17.4 billion, showing that Amazon's focus on efficiency and continued cost-cutting continues to lift the bottom line. Jassy has been laser-focused on trimming expenses across the company, cutting more than 27,000 jobs since the beginning of 2022. Amazon has continued to restructure its teams this year. Wall Street has applauded Jassy's campaign to rein in expenses, with Amazon shares up about 23% year to date. The Nasdaq has gained roughly 27% over the same stretch. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Peloton appoints Apple Fitness+ co-founder, now Ford executive, as its next CEO

Peloton has appointed its next CEO NEW YORK -- Peloton has appointed its next CEO. Peter Stern, co-founder of Apple Fitness+ and a current Ford executive, will soon helm of the tech-fitness company. Stern takes over as president and CEO on January 1, Peloton said Thursday. Karen Boone, one of two current interim CEOs, will continue to serve as chief executive through the end of the year, the company said. Shares for the New York company climbed more than 20% Thursday. Thursday's announcement arrives nearly six months after Barry McCarthy stepped down as Peloton’s chief executive. His departure in May came alongside larger restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the company, which included the layoffs of hundreds of employees. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of COVID-19, when many consumers turned to at-home workouts, but that all slowed as pandemic restrictions eased. As a result, the company has reported losses in more recent years. Peloton also reported Thursday that it lost $900,000 during its first quarter on revenue of $586 million. Both were better than Wall Street had expected. In efforts to turn things around, Peloton has been working on rebranding itself for some time — shifting its identity as a seller of luxury exercise bikes and equipment to health technology for all. The company recently unveiled plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at a discount at Costco this holiday season. And back in 2022, Peloton made its exercise bikes and other gear available on Amazon in the U.S. In a statement Thursday, Stern called working for Peloton “a dream come true" — adding that he is grateful for the opportunity "to take Peloton and its Members to even greater heights.” According to the company, Stern himself has been a Peloton member since 2016. He currently serves as president of Ford Integrated Services — and previously also held leadership roles at Time Warner Cable and Apple, where he co-founded Apple Fitness+. In connection with this week's announcement, Chris Bruzzo, who has been serving as Peloton's co-interim CEO alongside Boone, will step down on Friday. But both Bruzzo and Boone will remain members of Peloton's board. Stern is also expected to get a seat on the board. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech's vanishing perks have left employees to face a stark new reality

Boo! Did I scare you? If not, maybe this will surprise you: Microsoft disclosed an equity investment in OpenAI for the first time, SEC filings show. It could hint at an evolution in their relationship, as the tech giant previously described their deal as "a long-term partnership" in filings. In today's big story, Big Tech is pulling back on the freebies for its employees. What's on deck: But first, is this free? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Use it. Don't abuse it. That's the hard lesson tech workers are learning about their jobs' free perks, Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly, Rob Price, Hugh Langley, and Sydney Bradley write. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on the freebies. It's part of a broader push to cut costs across the industry. Those efforts took center stage recently when Meta fired employees for misusing Grubhub credits. Instead of buying food, people used the perk for things like laundry detergent and wine glasses. Employees everywhere have been known to bend the rules with work benefits. A Citibank employee was fired after expensing business trip meals he eventually admitted were for his partner. The difference for tech might be how widespread the perks are. Tech companies have gone out of their way to fully subsidize almost everything for their employees. It's not charity. The perks help recruit and retain talent and keep employees working at the office. (Free lunch at the office means more time spent working there.) A tech giant's pullback on one work perk is causing an uproar. Amazon's new return-to-office mandate, which requires employees in the office five days a week, continues to face pushback from its workforce. More than 500 employees signed a letter sent to Amazon Web Services' CEO Matt Garman criticizing his support of the policy, BI's Jyoti Mann and Ashley Stewart write. While speaking at an all-hands earlier this month, Garman said nine out of 10 Amazonians he spoke to were "actually quite excited about this change." Remote work made it harder to innovate and collaborate, he added. Some Amazon employees aren't buying it. In the letter to Garman, they said the lack of hard numbers backing up the decision "fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues." The true benefits and downsides of remote work are hard to nail down. Some studies have shown workers are more productive when working from home. Another conducted last year found remote work can stifle innovation. It's not all bad news for Amazon employees, though. When contacted by BI about the letter, a company spokesperson said in some cases Amazon would offer resources to employees like elder care and pet sitters. In other words, perks.

Title: Delphi Interactive’s Leadership on Challenging Gaming’s ‘Publisher Industrial Complex,’ Hiring Ex-Nordisk Games Chief Mikkel Weider (EXCLUSIVE)

By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst It’s been a tough year for the games business, with thousands of layoffs and game cancellations roiling the industry. Is there room for a new company emerging from stealth to tackle the AAA console and PC space? The leaders of Delphi Interactive are making a big bet they can make their mark on the sector as an independent player. Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard and president Andy Kleinman joined Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast to discuss their AAA-first business model, which kicked off with IO Interactive’s upcoming “Project 007,” and revealed their hiring of former Nordisk Games CEO Mikkel Weider as Delphi’s managing partner in Europe. Related Stories VIP+ Apple Deal Is Just a Piece of Amazon’s Streaming Marketplace Strategy Tim Burton Says Going on the Internet 'Scared Me' and 'I Got Quite Depressed': 'I Try to Avoid It' and Look at Clouds to Feel Better Weider “essentially blitz-scaled Nordisk Games from one employee to 1,300 in just a few years,” says Daugaard, describing how Weider expanded the gaming division of Denmark’s Nordisk Film by acquiring Swedish “Just Cause” developer Avalanche Studios in 2018 and “Until Dawn” studio Supermassive Games in 2022. Weider joins a team that Daugaard and Kleinman say counts seasoned talent with experience at EA, Rockstar Games and Microsoft Gaming’s roster of publishers. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: Until now, Delphi hasn’t made a peep about the company’s ambitions since “Project 007,” a James Bond origin story, was first announced in 2020. The game is being developed and published by IO Interactive, the company behind the long-running “Hitman” franchise, in association with Delphi, which is licensing the Bond intellectual property from producer Barbara Broccoli’s Danjaq holding company and MGM (Despite Amazon acquiring the latter in 2022, Amazon Games is not involved with “Project 007”). IO Interactive hasn’t revealed much about the game or its release window, but Daugaard sees “Project 007” as representative of Delphi’s mission, which includes a slate of unannounced projects. “In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard says. While IO Interactive remains the sole developer of “Hitman” and currently publishes it as an independent entity, that wasn’t always the case. The Danish studio spent more than a decade as a Square Enix subsidiary before its management buyout in 2017, a year after rebooting “Hitman” in 2016. IO Interactive then published “Hitman 2” in 2018 through Warner Bros. Games before going solo for “Hitman 3” in 2021, eventually repackaging all three games into its “World of Assassination” offering, which continues to add content and update the game for players. It’s the rare example of a predominantly single-player, AAA experience that has extended its shelf life well past its initial release window, which is typically when such games make the brunt of their sales. But as much as heralded AAA franchises like “The Last of Us,” “Uncharted” and “Fallout” have produced Hollywood hits, it’s often a different case when reversed. “Marvel’s Spider-Man” may be a PlayStation powerhouse, but 2024 has seen high-profile games like “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League” and “Star Wars Outlaws” flounder. Warner Bros. Discovery wrote down a $200 million loss for its gaming division on the “Suicide Squad“ title, bringing its “Hogwarts Legacy” victory lap to an end, while Ubisoft delayed its next “Assassin’s Creed” game in response to “Outlaws” falling short of sales expectations (Ubisoft is reportedly exploring a sale to Chinese tech giant Tencent). “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP,” says Daugaard. “They’ve also become fundamentally misaligned more and more with independent AAA developers. And that’s where Delphi saw an opportunity, a significant opportunity, to step in and offer a sort of very attractive alternative to owners of IP and to AAA developers.” Kleinman says Delphi has been “inspired a lot“ by companies like Legendary Entertainment. “Their whole thesis was that they could come in initially with financing, but their plan was to try to make these big blockbuster films outside of the legacy Hollywood studios,” he says. “Skydance came later and built a similar thesis, which has now become really big, and now they’re taking over [Paramount Global] to try to modernize it with their way of doing things. But that doesn’t exist in gaming, and especially in AAA gaming.” According to Daugaard, major publishers are “no longer ideal partners” for the biggest third-party IP, on account of what he and Kleinman believe is a prioritization of their wholly owned IP. He has a point. Leading live-service platforms have stepped in as lucrative partners to major Hollywood studios. Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games in 2024 to build IP-driven experiences on “Fortnite,“ while Universal and Warner Bros. partnered with Roblox to promote films like “Kung Fu Panda 4,” “Despicable Me 4,” “Godzilla x Kong” and “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” that hit their marks at the box office this year. Likewise, two of the Big Five movie studios — Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. — exist alongside full-fledged gaming divisions within their corporate parents. As Kleinman points out, that could become three if Skydance completes its acquisition of Paramount due to Skydance Interactive and Skydance New Media, though the latter division does have AAA Marvel and Star Wars games in the works. The significance of mobile gaming, which comprises half of the global video game market, shouldn’t be ignored either. Companies like Scopely, where Kleinman was once chief business officer, thrive on licensed IP, so much so that Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group for $4.9 billion in 2023 after the success of “Monopoly Go!” Before Scopely, Kleinman worked at mobile giant Zynga, which went to “Grand Theft Auto” parent Take-Two Interactive for $12.7 billion in 2022. Kleinman also worked at Disney Interactive some years before Disney CEO Bob Iger closed the division in 2016. Kleinman doesn’t seem fazed by the challenges involved in licensing major intellectual property. “When Disney or Warner Bros. or any of these studios are thinking about the strategy for some of the biggest IPs, it’s not just one thing that they do,” says Kleinman. “They explore different ways to attract the different types of fans [who] are engaged with that IP… Some of those fans are the audiences that are within Roblox and Fortnite and who want to have those games. They’re very engaged with those games… We think about the single-player, story-driven experience, and usually it starts with something that you know can be played in 12 to 16 hours, as opposed to 80 to 100 hours, and you feel a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you’re playing it.” As Daugaard puts it, “It’s natural that everybody wants a Fortnite. There’s an 11- or maybe even 12-figure upside to that, if you can pull that off.“ On the other hand, he adds, it’s also “a very volatile proposition with a massive downside, a massive risk.” For instance, Sony Interactive Entertainment is scaling back Playstation’s push into live services after “Concord“ was pulled from release less than two weeks after launching in August, resulting in the decision Tuesday to shutter its developer Firewalk Studios. An online game for “The Last of Us” was also cancelled last year and serious adjustments were made to “Destiny 2,” the once-thriving live service that helped make the case for Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie, in 2024. SIE cut 220 roles at Bungie and moved additional personnel to other PlayStation studios. The same day Firewalk was closed, EA announced competitive shooter “Apex Legends“ would undergo “large systematic change“ after an update missed expectations. Daugaard sees the evolution of “Hitman” as providing a reliable template for extending a gaming franchise, as opposed to creating a live service from scratch. “You have this strong core single-player experience, and then you carefully layer on live-services elements around this core, and then you expand in… these concentric circles from there and create a single-player-as-a-service that can be a very, very good business and very durable,” says Daugaard. “We think that is a more organic approach than launching a super expensive, mega live-services game and hope that people will show up.” “We are seeing a lot of great independent talent that we want to partner with, that want to partner with us some, because they’re looking for an alternative to these traditional publishers,” says Kleinman.

Title: The sales numbers for Intel’s new chips are just depressing

Time Published: 2024-10-30T22:53:17Z
Full Content:
Intel’s latest Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 200S processors have been off to a rocky debut, receiving middling reviews from hardware testers, including from our own testing. But according to recent sales data from Mindfactory, Germany’s leading online PC hardware retailer, not a single Core Ultra 200-series CPU has been sold so far. Meanwhile, AMD continues to dominate with 95% of Mindfactory’s CPU market share. This weak showing underscores significant challenges for Intel in a market that is traditionally open to new hardware innovations but has recently leaned heavily toward AMD’s Ryzen lineup due to competitive pricing and robust performance. 🔥 first Arrow Lake post launch sales numbersAMD share shoots up to 95% ℹ️ UnitsAMD: 730 units sold, 94.81%, ASP: 267Intel: 40, 5.19%, ASP: 388 ℹ️ RevenueAMD: 195201, 92.64%Intel: 15509, 7.36% pic.twitter.com/oaiyG8LO4L &mdash; TechEpiphany (@TechEpiphanyYT) October 29, 2024 The Arrow Lake lineup includes desktop SKUs like the Core Ultra 9 285K and Core Ultra 7 265K. Despite Intel’s latest AI and performance enhancements, these processors haven’t captured the interest of Germany’s PC enthusiasts. In fact, Mindfactory’s recent CPU sales charts reveal that Intel’s highest-ranking product, the Core i5-13400, languishes in 21st place, far behind AMD’s Ryzen chips, with sales volume primarily concentrated in AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 7 5700X3D. Intel’s processors accounted for just about 40 units sold, representing only 5% of total CPU sales — a stark contrast to AMD’s top-selling chips, which saw 190 and 80 units sold, respectively. This lackluster performance in Germany starkly contrasts Arrow Lake’s U.S. market presence where some SKUs, as per Tom’s Hardware, have sold out on platforms like Newegg and Amazon. However, the Core Ultra 200S series has not been universally well-received, with mixed reviews pointing to a regression in gaming performance compared to prior generations. In addition, Intel’s recent financial difficulties, including a reported $1.6 billion quarterly loss and layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce, may have impacted the company’s ability to aggressively push the Arrow Lake lineup in competitive markets. Another possible factor affecting Intel’s German sales could be regional discontent following the halted construction of Intel’s $30 billion chip fabrication plant in Magdeburg. Planned as part of a broader strategy to establish local manufacturing and strengthen ties with the European market, this delay — or potential abandonment — may have dampened enthusiasm for Intel’s products within Germany, further fueling AMD’s dominance. In sum, Intel faces an uphill battle to regain footing in a European market where AMD has established a significant presence, and Arrow Lake’s lackluster debut only adds to its recent setbacks. Addressing these challenges will require more than incremental hardware updates. Intel may need to rethink its strategy to convince discerning buyers that the Core Ultra series is worth the investment in a fiercely competitive landscape. Intel's upcoming Arrow Lake processors have been the topic of much speculation in the last few months, but we're finally at the finish line. Multiple sources are reporting that the release date we've been hearing about for weeks is now final, meaning that Intel's next-gen processors are now less than a month away. Here's what we know. With no Intel Innovation event this year, things have been quiet as far as Arrow Lake goes -- but the leaks never cease. The initial Arrow Lake (also known as Intel Core Ultra 200 series) release date that various tipsters spoke about was always said to be October 10, but a few weeks ago, it was revealed to be October 24. Now, with today's new information, we can say with some confidence that it appears to be the final release date. We first reported on the Intel CPU instability issue in February 2024, and since then, Intel has offered various fixes that helped, but still failed to fix the problem once and for all. Now, it finally seems like the owners of Intel's best CPUs might soon be able to rest easy. Intel has shared a new update that pinpoints the four causes of Raptor Lake problems and provides a fix. Intel's July update on the matter disclosed that the company was aware of issues within the microcode and that the problem was related to incorrect voltages. Today's update breaks this down into four operating scenarios that can cause problems. Intel now refers to these long-lasting issues as the "Vmin Shift Instability." Intel's list of best processors is about to expand with the upcoming launch of Arrow Lake-S, also referred to as Intel Core Ultra 200-series for desktops. But what comes next is less certain, and even more so now. According to a post on the Chiphell forums, Intel may have decided to cancel the Arrow Lake-S refresh (Intel Core Ultra 300-series, presumably) that was reportedly slated for sometime next year as a follow-up to this year's initial launch. On the upside, the code name for an upcoming desktop CPU generation was also leaked. The rumored Arrow Lake-S refresh was never confirmed, but there have been many whispers about it from various leakers. Much like the Raptor Lake refresh, it was never meant to be a groundbreaking update; the neural processing unit (NPU) was the main thing that was going to be updated.

Title: Dropbox lays off 20% of employees and joins Big Tech's flattening trend. Read CEO Drew Houston's memo.

Dropbox is the latest major company to slash its staff and flatten its organizational structure. In an email sent to employees on Wednesday, its CEO and cofounder, Drew Houston, announced that the cloud-storage company was laying off 528 employees — roughly 20% of its workforce. "As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I'm truly sorry to those impacted by this change," Houston wrote. These cuts come as the company undergoes what he called a "transitional period." It's focusing its efforts on its maturing file-sync-and-share business and products such as Dash, Dropbox's AI-powered work assistant. "However, navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable," Houston wrote. The Dropbox chief cited "softening demand and macro headwinds" in the company's core business. "But external factors are only part of the story," he added. "We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down." Houston said that the layoffs were targeting "over-invested or underperforming" areas. Dropbox is the latest example of a tech giant thinning out its management ranks to create a flatter organizational structure with the goal of moving faster. Amazon announced a similar move earlier this year, with CEO Andy Jassy saying he wanted senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." Mark Zuckerberg instituted manager cuts and increased the average number of direct reports for Meta managers after complaining about "managers managing managers." Dropbox's layoffs come more than a year after the company's decision to cut about 16% of its workforce, or 500 employees, in April 2023. Houston's memo to employees at the time also attributed those layoffs to headwinds and freeing up investment bandwidth for more products powered by artificial intelligence. Starting Wednesday, affected workers will be eligible for 16 weeks of pay, with an additional week of pay for each completed year of tenure, the memo said. They will also see their fourth-quarter equity vest and can access free job-placement and coaching services, it added. Affected employees can also keep their work-issued devices. Dropbox did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Jump to

The company's stock price was down slightly in after-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Sales in the third quarter jumped 19% year over year while net income grew 35% to $15.7 billion from $11.6 billion a year earlier. That represents Meta's lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023. The company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion. Meta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses. "Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts. Zuckerberg has been pointing to the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence, which includes spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company's core online ad business in the aftermath of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update. The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy. More than one million advertisers have used Meta's generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said. Meta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion. Meta's advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter. Revenue from Meta's Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company's slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein would affect Meta's overall revenue. Meta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion. The company's Reality Labs hardware unit posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts' expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts' expectations of $310.4 million. Since 2020, Meta's Reality Labs unit has recorded an operating loss of more than $58 billion. The company's overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30. The social media company's results come a day after digital ad companies Alphabet, Reddit and Snap all reported solid quarterly earnings. Microsoft reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines. Alphabet on Tuesday said third-quarter sales from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers. Microsoft on Wednesday reported that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services. Apple and Amazon report quarterly financials on Thursday.

Title: There’s No Way To Reach The Top Of Hollywood’s Corporate Ladders Because The Boomers Already There Won’t Leave

And your Boomer boss isn’t vacating that corner office anytime soon. Inside Hollywood’s Great Malaise. By Mia Galuppo Film Writer If you’re planning on attending Tom Rothman’s party in November, you’ll need a costume. Rumor has it the Sony chairman is asking invitees to the event — which is a joint birthday bash with his wife, actress Jessica Harper — to dress up as characters from movies made under his reign. Luckily, it’s a long list of wardrobe choices, stretching back a multitude of decades. You could go as Jack Dawson from 1997’s Titanic. Or Satine from 2001’s Moulin Rouge! Or Miranda Priestly from 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada. Or Rick Dalton from 2019’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Related Stories Movies How Janelle Monáe Became the Queen of Halloween Business Alex Cooper Is Blowing Up: "I'm a Motherf***er When It Comes to Business" The point here is, Rothman is turning 70 and has been in charge at Sony (and before that, Fox) for a very, very long time. As it happens, he’s not the only silver mogul in Hollywood these days. Bob Iger is 73 and has been running Disney off and on for nearly 20 years. Ari Emanuel, 63, has been running WME for nearly 30 years, since he started his agency in 1995 (after starting in the mail room at CAA, the company co-founded by then-28-year-old Michael Ovitz in 1975). Jeremy Zimmer, 66, has been running UTA for more than 30 years, since he co-founded that agency in 1991. Michael De Luca is a relative spring chicken at 59, but he’s been fronting studio slates — at New Line, MGM, Amazon and Warner Bros. — for three decades. Many of these no-longer-so-young Turks are now old enough to qualify for AARP discounts. But few of them seem in any huge rush to retire. And that’s the problem. Or at least it is for a new generation of ambitious show-business strivers under the age of 50 who find themselves unhappily stuck on the middle rungs of Hollywood’s corporate ladder. Unlike their bosses, some of whom ascended to the heights of authority in their 30s (Emanuel) and even their late 20s (De Luca), young professionals today — who are toiling in an industry plagued with title deflation and ever-diminishing paydays — see no clear path to the top. Not one that isn’t blocked by an all-powerful boomer who’s been perched in a corner office since the Bush administration. The first one. “These people have been making movies since the 1990s,” notes one 50-something former head of production. “That’s a long time to have a position of authority and to be a gatekeeper of cultural decisions.” “It’s become so fucking depressing,” agrees a veteran agent, also in his 50s. “Even 10 years ago, executives were like movie stars. They were making tons of movies and were empowered to be bold and do cool things. Now, most executives can’t even hire writers without asking their boss.” Of course, a lot of these bosses are still bosses for good reasons. Rothman, for one, can hog credit for more than 150 Oscar nominations for movies made during his long tenure at Sony. Many of these sexagenarians have built empires from the ground up, guided their companies through mergers, spinoffs and acquisitions, and have skillfully steered their workforces through an ever-revolving series of corporate overlords. They’ve not only proved they have staying power — they’ve proved there’s power in staying. Still, fair or not, there’s a mounting resentment among young (or young-er) Hollywood. Speaking (mostly off the record) with studio executives, producers, agents, assistants — dozens of entertainment industry professionals ranging from their 20s to their 60s — there’s a wide consensus that the kids aren’t alright. Many younger execs feel they’re spinning their wheels, going nowhere — and not even particularly fast — with increasing numbers abandoning Hollywood altogether and decamping for careers in other trades (like, gasp, data analytics). Obviously, there are myriad reasons for the malaise gripping the town — the lingering aftereffects of the pandemic, the industry-wide economic shrinkage, the labor unrest, the waves and waves of layoffs. But a lot of young executives also are casting weary glances at the aging eminences who’ve been occupying Hollywood’s C-suites seemingly forever. The time has come, you can all but hear them rumbling, to start handing out gold watches. *** You’re a 37-year-old mid-level studio exec. You wake up in Hollywood in the year of our Bryan Lourd, 2024. From bed, you check your email and find the latest gloomy blasts from the trades: another 15 percent staff reduction at Paramount Global, and Disney is planning about 300 more layoffs. There’s also an email from a former exec you used to do business with, and you almost scroll past it, at first not recognizing their personal Gmail. Lately, there have been a lot of emails from personal accounts as people shed their corporate addresses or, more likely, as those corporations shed them. This one is a victim from one of the layoffs that happened three or six months prior, you can’t remember which, but you are confident that the quarterly earnings report claimed profitability. They are hoping to take you out to coffee in their latest go around town to see if anywhere is hiring. You thought you had heard they went into real estate, but it must have been someone else. You’ve considered jumping careers yourself, even researched a couple of grad schools, but that was before they finally gave you the promotion they had been talking about since before the strikes. The pay bump wasn’t what you imagined, but you got equity. Or was it that they traded some of your salary for stock? It doesn’t matter, you are barely making what it takes to afford the mortgage on the $1.2 million median home price in Los Angeles County, but it convinced you to hang on for another year. Sunk cost is supposed to be a fallacy, but what do you know? You didn’t get past the home screen for that online MBA program. You are fast approaching 40, living the current reality of the Hollywood dream, and you just want to go back to bed. Of course, it was not always this way. Back in 1986, the Los Angeles Times ran a story headlined “Baby Mogul Running Fast for Fox.” It was about a 28-year-old whiz kid — maybe you’ve heard of him, Scott Rudin? — who had just taken over as president of production at 20th Century Fox, where he was overseeing releases like Penny Marshall’s Big and the Coen brothers’ Raising Arizona. The story laid out the ages of the other heads of the then-eight major Hollywood studios, including Disney’s chairman, Jeff Katzenberg, who was just 35 at the time. And that was Katzenberg’s second job as studio chief; he’d been all of 31 when he got hired to run Paramount. The median age of the presidents of production of the majors in 1986 was 35. “They were who I had in my head when I started in Hollywood,” says a current studio executive in his 50s of these former wunderkinds. “Now that I’ve got here, it’s the worst time to have this job.” Less than a decade after Rudin took over at Fox, De Luca bested him by a year, getting hired at age 27 as New Line’s president of production in 1993. De Luca didn’t have greenlight authority back then, but he had the next best thing — the ear and backing of New Line chairman Bob Shaye. “I walked into [Shaye’s office] with a 170-page epic on porn in the ’70s and a guy with a 13-inch penis,” De Luca once recalled his pitch for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights. “And he was fine with it.” Today, it’s hard to imagine any 20-something having that kind of clout in Hollywood. Or even a 30-something. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine De Luca, now co-chair and CEO of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, greenlighting a Boogie Nights-like screenplay brought to him by an underling. According to younger execs, that’s precisely what’s wrong with the industry in 2024: It’s still being run by the same people who ran it in 1994. “You look at Mike De Luca, who goes from MGM to Amazon over to Warner Bros. You look at Tom Rothman, who goes from Fox to Sony. These same people are being recycled, and because they’re being recycled, there’s less opportunity for the people under them to be given a shot,” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts (and a former THR editor). “And giving them a shot now seems high-risk.” It’s not just graying studio chiefs who are stubbornly clinging to their jobs; the layers of execs beneath them — the executive vps and those under them, and also those under them — also are sticking in jobs for longer. Who can blame them? Right now, there aren’t a whole lot of other jobs out there. Meanwhile, the cost of retirement continues to rise, especially for those accustomed to a certain Hollywood lifestyle. People are living longer; health care and home care have never been more expensive. There’s every reason to stay put, if you can. “The challenges in sustaining yourself in Hollywood have become greater,” notes a 50-something producer. “So, you hold on for dear life.” The word a lot of folks in the business banter about is “contraction.” But what comes right after is in some ways an even scarier word: “stagnation.” *** If the upshot of all this were merely the shattered career dreams of a bunch of Gen X and millennial movie executives, this story probably wouldn’t have been written. But the implications for the film business — and for the wider cinematic culture — are actually pretty profound, at least according to many of the Gen X and millennial movie executives with whom THR spoke. “It’s a massive problem that the people in power are so far away from Gen Z,” says a mid-30s producer. “They show up for movies when they have something that speaks to them, but whenever they happen upon something that appeals to Gen Z, it feels like they just stepped on a rake.” “You get to a point where you’re living in your beautiful house in the hills, you’re meeting only other wealthy people and you’re not connecting to the audience,” adds Galloway. “And the moviegoing audience is primarily young, so at a certain point you become really detached from them.” Which explains why so much of what Hollywood is producing these days feels so familiar. For instance, there are currently remakes or sequels in development for ’80s classics like An Officer and a Gentleman, Ghost and Dirty Dancing — projects that have little or no emotional resonance to anyone under 50. Obviously, remakes have long been a studio staple. But a War of the Roses redo? A new Running Man offering? It’s unclear whether these nostalgia plays will be all that appealing even to people over 50. Meanwhile, younger executives, especially from underrepresented communities, are navigating studios that are still overwhelmingly white and male, and finding it increasingly difficult to get attention for projects outside of a four-quadrant family film. “[Studios] hired all these mission-driven people of color who now can’t make their passion projects,” says one 30-something agent. “Now, everyone wants Yellowstone.” “Boomers tend to value their own opinions, and they all validate each other,” says a studio executive in their 40s. “They built these systems to just take care of each other. There is no trust with anyone other than themselves.” To be fair, it’s not just boomer bosses who are distrustful these days. There’s been a general trend toward top-down management at many of the studios and even streamers, and it has little to do with age. Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria — who is only 53 — has sat in on humble pitch meetings, something that used to be considered well below her title’s pay grade. As the industry contracts — and stagnates — it becomes more and more risk-averse, with those in charge hoarding their power rather than sharing it with fresh talent coming up through the ranks, in essence starving the next generation of the experience necessary to grow beyond their current titles. (Also, for that matter, starving the town of personality.) “The business used to be a little more batshit crazy,” notes a former production president. “Everyone used to be a lunatic. Now it feels a little more polite. A little more suit-y. Not that people are wearing suits.” Stapler-throwing aside, Hollywood’s more freewheeling ways did tend to yield extraordinary content. Film executives used to make their mark by championing idiosyncratic projects, sometimes putting their careers on the line to do so, then using that win — if there was one — to catapult themselves to their next title or another studio. That doesn’t happen so much anymore. In the age of the plug-and-play franchise, it’s become harder for executives to stand out. And even when they do, it doesn’t always guarantee a promotion. For instance, Nathan Samdahl, the production exec who brought in and oversaw the original horror film Smile, was laid off at Paramount Global in a 2022 cost-cutting effort — just before the movie went on to become one of the studio’s most profitable of the year. (Samdahl eventually found a new home at Walter Hamada’s production banner.) Stagnation, of course, isn’t just rough on those in first class; turbulence is always worse at the back of the plane. The old route to mogul used to start in the mail room — where Emanuel began his journey — but these days even landing a junior job is a lot harder than it used to be. Galloway notes that Chapman University’s career center has clocked a dip of 30 percent in entry-level gigs over the past year. Those few lucky enough to snag an assistant gig often find themselves working even longer hours than their predecessors did, assigned to multiple desks, earning somewhere between $21 to $25 an hour with lessening chances of advancement. All this career inertia isn’t just bad for Hollywood’s younger workforce. In the long run, it’s bad for the future of the business. In fact, it’s potentially deadly. It means that someday, maybe soon, there won’t be anybody left in Hollywood’s dwindling workforce who’ll have a clue about how to run a set. Or a slate. Or a studio. Says one 50-something former studio exec of the looming brain-drain crisis, “It’s an existential threat.” What’s the way forward? How do we find our way out of this stagnation quagmire? Maybe Hollywood, never one for original ideas on or off the screen, should look backward, to the earliest days of the film business. One role model for yesterday’s whiz kid turned today’s silver mogul might be David O. Selznick, who became RKO’s head of production in 1931, at age 29, went on to make Gone With the Wind, Rebecca, Spellbound, A Star Is Born and a slew of other enduring classics, then abruptly stopped making movies and functionally retired in 1948 because, as he put it, “I was tired.” He was 46.

Title: Alphabet’s stock jumps as cloud fuels strong revenue growth

UPDATED 20:14 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Google LLC’s parent company Alphabet Inc. trading higher in the after-hours session today following a solid earnings beat driven by strong cloud revenue growth. Alphabet’s stock was up more than 5% in extended trading, adding to a slight gain made during the regular trading session. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.12 per share on revenue of $88.27 billion, up 15% from a year ago. The results were better than expected. Wall Street had been anticipating earnings of just $1.85 per share on lower sales of $86.3 billion. Alphabet’s all-important Google Cloud unit delivered revenue of $11.35 billion, representing growth of 35% on the $8.41 billion in sales it reported one year earlier. The company said this growth was primarily driven by rapid update of its artificial intelligence services, which includes subscriptions to enterprise customers. On a conference call with analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai (pictured) insisted that Google Cloud’s “full stack” of AI products and services is already up and running at scale, used by billions of people worldwide and “creating a virtuous cycle.” With today’s report, Alphabet becomes the first of several “megacap” technology companies to report its latest earnings results, with Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. set to report Wednesday, and Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. to follow on Thursday. The company reported that its net income rose to $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $19.7 billion in the same period one year earlier. Google Search delivered $49.4 billion in sales during the quarter, up 12.3% from a year earlier, and it remains the biggest single contributor in terms of revenue growth, said Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi. She told investors that the company is planning to use AI to streamline workflows, manage its headcount and its physical footprint going forward, as it looks to build on its earlier cost-cutting efforts, which included thousands of layoffs last year and several hundred more earlier this year. “I plan to build on these efforts but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities,” Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet in June after spending 23 years at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly Co. Alphabet’s advertising business also grew well in the quarter, with revenue of $65.85 billion, up from $59.65 billion in the year-ago quarter, though it grew at a slower pace on a sequential basis. Within that segment, YouTube’s advertising revenue came to $8.92 billion, just ahead of the analyst’s target of $8.89 billion, with more rapid growth than in the previous quarter. That growth was encouraging as the Google-owned company has faced strong pressure from other advertising competitors such as Amazon, Netflix Inc. and TikTok’s parent company Bytedance Ltd. Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said one reason for the growth is that AI is helping to improve YouTube recommendations. It has been using the Gemini large language model family to help recommend “more relevant, fresher and personalized content” to viewers, he insisted. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said Alphabet’s results can be taken as a bellwether of what’s to come from the other big tech stocks set to report earnings later this week, as he’s expecting a “very strong season” thanks to a “surprisingly resilient economy and growingly supportive monetary outlook.” The analyst believes this is reflected in both Alphabet’s cloud and advertising businesses. “While some of these numbers certainly come from the positive seasonality, particularly with the U.S. election driving increasing interest in YouTube and search, the stock has been fairly underpriced amid a market that can’t seem to get enough tailwinds,” Monteiro said. Another encouraging sign was the performance of Google Workspace, which is Alphabet’s productivity tool suite. Ashkenazi said it also showed “strong growth,” as did Google Cloud Platform, which is the company’s data management and AI development suite, with revenue growing faster than that of the overall cloud unit. The Other Bets division, which includes Alphabet’s life sciences business Verily and the self-driving car division Waymo, delivered sales of $388 million during the quarter, up from $297 million in the same period one year ago. Waymo last week closed on a bumper $5.6 billion funding round, and aims to expand its nascent robotaxi service beyond Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, where it currently operates. Pichai also talked up Google Lens, an image recognition product that uses smartphone cameras to conduct visual searches. According to Pichai, usage of the service has grown to more than 20 billion visual searches per month, making it one of the company’s fastest-growing products. He said it’s most often used by people out shopping, to find more information about the products they’re looking at. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors have lots to be happy about, with Google Cloud showing strong growth thanks to its AI offerings. He said he’s optimistic about the company’s future AI growth too, thanks to its ongoing efforts to provide the best infrastructure for AI models. “Google has just announced the sixth generation of its TPU architecture, which leads the market in terms of performance,” Mueller said. “It has a three-to-four year lead over its rivals in putting custom algorithms on custom silicon, and that is illustrated by its fast-growing Google Cloud revenue. That’s why it’s no surprise to see Google is drinking its own champagne, using AI to try and increase the operational efficiency of its business.” During the quarter, Alphabet’s executive team saw quite a shakeup. Along with Ashkenazi’s arrival, the company also replaced its longtime Search and Ads boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, who previously headed up the team leading the development of Google Assistant. In addition, Alphabet revealed that the team responsible for the Google Gemini app is joining Google DeepMind, where it will report to Demis Hassabis. Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, hailed Alphabet’s strong beat across the board. “It reported stronger-than-expected revenue in all categories, including search, YouTube ads and Google Cloud, leading to 15%+ revenue growth,” he said. In light of the results, Wlodarczak said Pivotal is raising its expectations for Alphabet in the fourth quarter and beyond, reiterating its “buy” rating on the stock, which still has “substantial upside from current levels.” THANK YOU Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO SECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 5 HOURS AGO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors INFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 16 HOURS AGO Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments APPS - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 17 HOURS AGO Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays CLOUD - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 18 HOURS AGO

Within that segment, YouTube’s advertising revenue came to $8.92 billion, just ahead of the analyst’s target of $8.89 billion, with more rapid growth than in the previous quarter. That growth was encouraging as the Google-owned company has faced strong pressure from other advertising competitors such as Amazon, Netflix Inc. and TikTok’s parent company Bytedance Ltd. Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said one reason for the growth is that AI is helping to improve YouTube recommendations. It has been using the Gemini large language model family to help recommend “more relevant, fresher and personalized content” to viewers, he insisted. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said Alphabet’s results can be taken as a bellwether of what’s to come from the other big tech stocks set to report earnings later this week, as he’s expecting a “very strong season” thanks to a “surprisingly resilient economy and growingly supportive monetary outlook.” The analyst believes this is reflected in both Alphabet’s cloud and advertising businesses. “While some of these numbers certainly come from the positive seasonality, particularly with the U.S. election driving increasing interest in YouTube and search, the stock has been fairly underpriced amid a market that can’t seem to get enough tailwinds,” Monteiro said. Another encouraging sign was the performance of Google Workspace, which is Alphabet’s productivity tool suite. Ashkenazi said it also showed “strong growth,” as did Google Cloud Platform, which is the company’s data management and AI development suite, with revenue growing faster than that of the overall cloud unit. The Other Bets division, which includes Alphabet’s life sciences business Verily and the self-driving car division Waymo, delivered sales of $388 million during the quarter, up from $297 million in the same period one year ago. Waymo last week closed on a bumper $5.6 billion funding round, and aims to expand its nascent robotaxi service beyond Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, where it currently operates. Pichai also talked up Google Lens, an image recognition product that uses smartphone cameras to conduct visual searches. According to Pichai, usage of the service has grown to more than 20 billion visual searches per month, making it one of the company’s fastest-growing products. He said it’s most often used by people out shopping, to find more information about the products they’re looking at. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors have lots to be happy about, with Google Cloud showing strong growth thanks to its AI offerings. He said he’s optimistic about the company’s future AI growth too, thanks to its ongoing efforts to provide the best infrastructure for AI models. “Google has just announced the sixth generation of its TPU architecture, which leads the market in terms of performance,” Mueller said. “It has a three-to-four year lead over its rivals in putting custom algorithms on custom silicon, and that is illustrated by its fast-growing Google Cloud revenue. That’s why it’s no surprise to see Google is drinking its own champagne, using AI to try and increase the operational efficiency of its business.” During the quarter, Alphabet’s executive team saw quite a shakeup. Along with Ashkenazi’s arrival, the company also replaced its longtime Search and Ads boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, who previously headed up the team leading the development of Google Assistant. In addition, Alphabet revealed that the team responsible for the Google Gemini app is joining Google DeepMind, where it will report to Demis Hassabis. Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, hailed Alphabet’s strong beat across the board. “It reported stronger-than-expected revenue in all categories, including search, YouTube ads and Google Cloud, leading to 15%+ revenue growth,” he said. In light of the results, Wlodarczak said Pivotal is raising its expectations for Alphabet in the fourth quarter and beyond, reiterating its “buy” rating on the stock, which still has “substantial upside from current levels.” THANK YOU Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO SECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 5 HOURS AGO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors INFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 16 HOURS AGO Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments APPS - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 17 HOURS AGO Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays CLOUD - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 18 HOURS AGO

Send an email to Katrina. Is Jeff Bezos going to bring back real journalism? In a shocking move, The Washington Post announced Friday it would not be endorsing a presidential candidate, after decades of doing so and after the outlet’s editorial board had written an endorsement of Kamala Harris. Two Post journalists reported that the decision had been made by Post owner Bezos, the billionaire behind shopping behemoth Amazon and rocket company Blue Origin. For many subscribers, Bezos’ action was a betrayal. More than 200,000 people—or about 8% of The Washington Post’s subscriber base—canceled their subscriptions, NPR reported. Several Post journalists resigned. Accusations swirled that Bezos’ decision was influenced by business considerations. (He says it was not.) “The Washington Post has gone from ‘All The President’s Men’ to ‘All The Dictator’s Lapdogs,’” sneered one reader, according to Post columnist Dana Milbank. Another reader wrote, “Without resigning, you are basically endorsing Hitler.” But for the American people, this might signal the beginning of a new era of journalism. USA Today will also not endorse a presidential candidate this year, and owner Patrick Soon-Shiong decided the Los Angeles Times would not be endorsing this year either. Indeed, kudos to @JeffBezos https://t.co/UNh4rlB3lS In a column published Monday night on The Washington Post, Bezos decided to speak for himself—and in the course of doing so, he also spoke up for the millions of Americans who have watched in horror as major American news outlets have morphed into propaganda rags valuing ideology over truth. “In the annual public surveys about trust and reputation, journalists and the media have regularly fallen near the very bottom, often just above Congress,” wrote Bezos. “But in this year’s Gallup poll, we have managed to fall below Congress.” “Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working.” According to the Gallup poll cited by Bezos, more than two-thirds of Americans have no or little trust or confidence in the media. Given the sorry state of news reporting these days, that’s not surprising—and The Washington Post itself has played a major role in why Americans are rightly skeptical of media. Consider the Post’s ridiculously hyperbolic slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” That slogan, the first in the Post’s history, was launched in 2017, a mere month after Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. So much for a veneer of fairness toward the new administration. And what about the Post’s coverage of the alleged Trump-Russia collusion? The Washington Post in 2021 had to correct and remove significant portions of two articles, published in 2017 and 2019, about the infamous Steele Dossier. But that wasn’t the only thing the outlet should be embarrassed about when it comes to its coverage of Trump’s so-called collusion with Russia. The Columbia Journalism Review, no conservative outlet, published last year a damning review of how top outlets, including The Washington Post, covered the matter. For instance, Post opinion columnist Josh Rogin wrote an article during the 2016 GOP convention headlined “Trump campaign guts GOP’s anti-Russian stance on Ukraine,” referring to the Republican platform. Rogin’s report “caught the attention of other journalists,” writes Jeff Gerth for the Columbia Journalism Review. “Within a few days, Paul Krugman, in his [New York] Times column, called Trump the ‘Siberian candidate,’ citing the ‘watering down’ of the platform. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, labeled Trump a ‘de facto agent’ of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. He cited the Rogin report …” Gerth, who spent decades at The New York Times as an investigative reporter, adds, “The story would turn out to be an overreach.” “Subsequent investigations found that the original draft of the platform was actually strengthened by adding language on tightening sanctions on Russia for Ukraine-related actions, if warranted, and calling for ‘additional assistance’ for Ukraine. What was rejected was a proposal to supply arms to Ukraine, something the Obama administration hadn’t done,” he explained. Whoops? Bob Woodward, the longtime investigative reporter who broke the Watergate story, referred to the Steele Dossier as a “garbage document” in a 2017 interview with “Fox News Sunday.” According to Gerth, Woodward attempted to make the case against the dossier to his Post colleagues. Those colleagues apparently weren’t interested in what the respected investigative journalist had to say. “To be honest, there was a lack of curiosity on the part of the people at the Post about what I had said, why I said this, and I accepted that, and I didn’t force it on anyone,” Woodward told Gerth about his colleagues’ response. Of course, we know now from special counsel John Durham’s 2023 report that the Steele Dossier was indeed a “garbage document.” In an analysis of the Durham report, Heritage Foundation legal scholars John Malcolm, Cully Stimson, and Zack Smith wrote that “the Russian intelligence officers could have fed disinformation to the very people who were ultimately cited in the series of six reports prepared by Christopher Steele—the so-called Steele dossier—on behalf of the [Hillary] Clinton campaign and furnished to the FBI.” Nor was it only Russia collusion where the Post seemed driven by politics, not facts. In Trump’s first 100 days in office, the Post calculated he made 492 false or misleading claims. But the Post claimed that President Joe Biden only made 78 false or misleading claims in his first 100 days in office. While Trump may talk more and in a looser style than Biden, it simply strains credulity that he was guilty of five times as many falsehoods as Biden in the same period of time. Another clear example of bias was how The Washington Post approached the issue of Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop and his emails, first reported in October 2020 by the New York Post. Writing on the New York Post report in that same month, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler talked about former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s conversations with a Ukrainian lawmaker and commented that those “interactions have given rise to fears that the [Hunter Biden] emails could be part of a broader disinformation campaign.” (Talking to Ukrainian lawmakers wouldn’t be cool until Democrats did it, apparently.) It wasn’t until March of 2022 that The Washington Post admitted the laptop–and the emails—were legitimate. While Bezos may be pivoting, all of these examples took place under his ownership of the paper, which he acquired in 2013. Furthermore, Bezos’ own words suggest that he thinks The Washington Post is more guilty of the appearance of bias, rather than actual bias. “Let me give an analogy. Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must believe they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first,” he writes. “Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement.” But of course, journalists in major media outlets are also failing on the first requirement. That’s not good. Endorsements from the editorial board aren't what killed the reputation of the @washingtonpost, it's the blatant leftwing bias of the reporters and editors on the news side that caused them to lose the trust of so many Americans. CC @JeffBezos https://t.co/lXS2aQfMfZ Sure, I’m grateful to be part of The Daily Signal, which—along with outlets such as The Federalist, Just The News, The Daily Wire, The Washington Free Beacon, The Daily Caller, and more—has risen up in a time when Americans desperately need more options for credible news reporting. But the fact is that The Washington Post employs around 940 journalists. The New York Times employs 1,700 journalists. Prior to layoffs earlier this year, NBC News and MSNBC had 3,500 employees, as did CNN. The Daily Signal currently has 13 full-time employees. You see the problem? Sure, my fervent hope is that The Daily Signal will continue growing and adding new reporters. (Donate here to support our serious news reporting.) But even if we quadrupled our number of journalists, we would still be less than 5% the size of The Washington Post. Good, exhaustive reporting that prioritizes truth is expensive and time-consuming. To thoroughly cover the enormous U.S. government, it’s critical to have a huge staff. Bezos has an enormous opportunity here to use his and the Post’s resources to bring back serious, credible news reporting, reporting that is driven by the truth and the need for the government to be accountable to the American people. He was brave enough to stick his neck out and deny an endorsement to Harris. And he was brave enough, amid the uproar, to defend his position. “I will … not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance—overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs—not without a fight. It’s too important. The stakes are too high,” wrote Bezos. “Now more than ever, the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world? To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles.” He’s certainly right about exercising new muscles. The Post could start by trying to cover lawmakers from both parties similarly and by adding conservative voices to its opinion pages more regularly. But if Bezos is serious, this could be an amazing opportunity for the Post and for Americans hoping for a serious news organization that informs, not indoctrinates. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences. By supporting The Daily Signal Institute today, you will help cut through the liberal media spin and provide honest, thorough, and responsible reporting to millions of Americans and decisionmakers in Washington.

Title: Inside Intel, CEO Pat Gelsinger fumbled the revival of an American icon

Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake. Intel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging US investment in US chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honour the discount, the sources said: about 40 percent off the US$23,000 ($35,000), 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or cancelling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel’s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it. Intel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview. “Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.” Intel’s revenue shrivelled to US$54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose US$3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at US$22.92 on Monday, off 66 percent from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO. The crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs. Intel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to US$45 billion in US support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation. Intel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumours, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.” Customers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said. Still, US Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said in September US manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want US-made leading-edge chips,” she said. Intel’s stumbles have implications for US industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under US control on US soil. A White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than US$11 billion in proposed funding under the act. Gelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly seven percent on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest US$20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidise American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another US$20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach US$100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” 'Five reasons to believe' Chip sales boomed in the Covid-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25 percent in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centres to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the US, three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company cancelled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data centre group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganisation required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save US$3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. ChatGPT moment Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centres behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a US$1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to US$16.9 million in 2023 from US$11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most US$500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least US$1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the US$1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over US$1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell US$1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100 percent of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than US$2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than US$500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data centre chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. Manufacturing woes Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than US$60 billion. Then, this summer [winter, in Australia], he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20 percent of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.”

Intel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview. “Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.” Intel’s revenue shrivelled to US$54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose US$3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at US$22.92 on Monday, off 66 percent from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO. The crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs. Intel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to US$45 billion in US support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation. Intel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumours, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.” Customers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said. Still, US Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said in September US manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want US-made leading-edge chips,” she said. Intel’s stumbles have implications for US industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under US control on US soil. A White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than US$11 billion in proposed funding under the act. Gelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly seven percent on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest US$20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidise American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another US$20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach US$100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” 'Five reasons to believe' Chip sales boomed in the Covid-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25 percent in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centres to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the US, three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company cancelled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data centre group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganisation required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save US$3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. ChatGPT moment Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centres behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a US$1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to US$16.9 million in 2023 from US$11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most US$500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least US$1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the US$1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over US$1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell US$1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100 percent of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than US$2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than US$500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data centre chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. Manufacturing woes Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than US$60 billion. Then, this summer [winter, in Australia], he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20 percent of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.”

Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake. Intel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement. Instead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging US investment in US chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.” In public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honour the discount, the sources said: about 40 percent off the US$23,000 ($35,000), 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal. Asked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthy business relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer. Gelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems. This account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records. Gelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or cancelling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say. And like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a "foundry," an operation that makes chips designed by other companies.

(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on) * Gelsinger's comments offended TSMC, which did not honor discount * Revenue and stock price have declined sharply under Gelsinger * Intel's 18A chip process faces delays and technical issues By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin, Dawn Chmielewski, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon.

He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring. Intel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI. His return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly 7% on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge. Intel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said. The bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest $20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence. Gelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidize American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another $20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach $100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.” ‘FIVE REASONS TO BELIEVE’ Chip sales boomed in the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25% in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centers to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house. Gelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.” Intel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.” Gelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the U.S., three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said. But after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company canceled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action. Sandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data center group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganization required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.” Intel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter. Gelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save $3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs. Under his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring. CHATGPT MOMENT Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centers behind ChatGPT. Originally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel. Nvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a $1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses. Gelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to $16.9 million in 2023 from $11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows. Around this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs. Teams at Intel estimated it could sell at most $500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least $1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying. Gelsinger touted the $1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.” According to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell $1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said. Intel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100% of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.” As recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than $2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than $500 million. At times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel. Intel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported. On Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data center chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.” Intel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs. MANUFACTURING WOES Gelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than $60 billion. Then, this summer, he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans. Intel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark. Some customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A. When one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom , sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20% of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields. Broadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry. On the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process. A recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said. Apple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three people with knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment. Intel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A. Gelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan. “I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.” (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: There’s a Better Way to Express Your Anger at the Washington Post. Too Bad Most People Won’t Do It.

Time Published: 2024-10-29T17:06:28Z
Full Content:
If you’re like me, your social media feeds for the past few days have been full of posts with screenshots of “We’ve Canceled Your Subscription” notices and comments to the effect of “This will not stand, Washington Post!” Never before have so many people—200,000, according to one report—gotten such an ecstatic hit of online righteousness out of saving themselves 200 bucks a year. These are the times that remind us of how little most people understand how journalism works. Some commenters on Facebook seem to think the paper as a whole decided not to endorse a presidential candidate this year. To the contrary: The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, forced the decision in spite of editors’ arguments in favor of publishing an endorsement of Kamala Harris that had already been written. Several of those opinion-page editors have since resigned in protest. Bezos alone is responsible for this pathetically unconvincing attempt to portray the Post as neutral in the race, and late Monday the paper published his self-defense, an unconvincing assertion that this last-minute change in editorial policy was meant to correct the perception that the Post is biased. Bezos insists that no quid pro quo was involved, but as many have pointed out, he stands to lose various lucrative government contracts should Donald Trump become president and wreak the revenge he has promised on his many perceived enemies. This is a disgraceful situation, but all these people posting on social media are doing nothing to help and in fact are only making things worse. There is, however, a simple step you could take that would both demonstrate your disapproval and rebuff a company that really makes this country worse. Rather than cancel your Post subscription, I say, cancel Amazon Prime. The Washington Post is already a struggling institution, having undergone layoffs and buyouts just last month. If 200,000 subscribers permanently bail on the paper, it may never recover. Or it may survive with much of its coverage cut back, and that may trigger a spiral into oblivion somewhere down the road as the remaining subscribers decide that a pale shadow of the Post’s former self is not worth paying for. Many bad things would follow from this, including journalists losing their jobs and the elimination of noncore sections that I value, like the Washington Post Book World. Most of all, however, there’s a lot of good, important journalism that won’t happen if the Post isn’t around (or can’t afford) to do it. Those who are showily canceling must surely be aware, thanks to their subscriptions, of the breadth and depth of the Post’s reporting. I read three or four Post articles every day, and I don’t live anywhere near D.C. In the weeks before the current scandal, I read this terrific piece about how an alarming conspiracy-addled militia group tried to take over a North Carolina town in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. I read this report, by Ben Brasch on how Florida’s health department has tried to criminalize TV stations for running ads in support of repealing the state’s draconian six-week abortion ban. I was chilled by this long profile, by Shawn Boburg and Chris Dehghanpoor, of a bullied teen convicted of running dozens of harassment campaigns against other children. The Post maintains essential databases of police shootings and mass shootings in America. It also runs substantive service journalism, like this column, by Michael J. Coren, about the threat of climate change on homeowners, with a widget that can assess the vulnerability of specific counties. When you cancel your subscription to the Post, you don’t punish Jeff Bezos. You punish the journalists who write such stories, including, ironically, the journalists who wrote and prepared to publish the very endorsement you’re so angry about. As one Post staffer told me, “The journalists who produce the Washington Post had no role in this decision, and yet they’re the only people who will be really hurt if you cancel your subscription.” And if those journalists lose their jobs, what happens to them? The most clueless subscription-cancelers of all maintain that they’ll just get jobs elsewhere. Apparently there are still people out there who don’t know that the business model for journalism is currently in free fall, with only brand-name legacy organizations, like the Post and the New York Times, able to hold on by their fingernails while still providing in-depth reporting. Last year alone, 131 local newspapers shuttered, a loss that has fostered the increasing polarization of their communities. Even if you don’t feel sorry for middle-class people losing their jobs, this is a massive civic injury. Contributing to the death of journalism will not hurt Jeff Bezos; it will just make the United States a dumber, more dangerous place. But canceling Amazon Prime, and communicating your reasons for doing so, is a step you can take that directly rebukes Jeff Bezos. There are plenty of good reasons not to patronize Amazon. And although Bezos no longer wholly owns the company, it remains the source of his fortune and therefore his power. (The Post, on the other hand, seems to be little more than his hobby.) Two hundred thousand people canceling Prime wouldn’t be catastrophic for a company that made over $40 billion on subscriptions last year. But given that Prime is the engine that runs the whole retail arm of the company, no dent in its subscriber base will go unnoticed. If the argument is that rich people care more about safeguarding their money than they do about higher principles, then if you want to hit them, show them you’re willing to hit them where they make that money, even if that means inconveniencing yourself. Unfortunately, this is a bridge too far for a lot of us. I’ve heard from a handful of very honest persons that canceling Prime calls for a “bravery” that they don’t possess. The free press is one thing, but do not come for our free two-day shipping! This is why I think canceling Prime actually speaks louder than canceling your Post subscription. It’s a genuine sacrifice, not a performative social media gesture, and one that, sadly, some people regard as more painful than losing the Post. I’m as angry as anyone about Bezos’ interference with the Post’s endorsement policy, even if the endorsement itself is pretty meaningless. It was already crystal clear from everything else the Post has published this year whom it would advise readers to vote for. But it is all that other journalism the Post has published, and that it has yet to publish, that stands the best chance of influencing the race. Embarrassing Bezos is the one thing this cancellation campaign has been able to accomplish. But in making him pay the price of a temporary shaming, I’m not ready to give up on a paper that has proved its worth to me over and over again.

Title: Starbucks threatens to fire staff who do not go back to office

CHICAGO - Starbucks is telling its corporate staff they could be fired if they do not go to work at the office three days a week. Starting in January, Starbucks will implement a “standardised process” to hold workers accountable if they do not abide by the coffee chain’s return-to-office (RTO) policy, according to a memo sent to one of the company’s divisions that was seen by Bloomberg News. Consequences are “up to, and including, separation”, the e-mail said. The message marks an escalation in enforcement of the company’s hybrid work rules less than two months after Mr Brian Niccol took over as chief executive. He told employees in September that they should work wherever they need to in order to get their jobs done, but that he thought that place was usually the office. Starbucks said its expectations for hybrid workers had not changed and that holiday, sick time and business travel are excluded from the calculation. Workers can request an exemption from the mandate due to physical, mental, sensory impairment or another disability, the company said. The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate employees. Most of them are employed at its stores. “We are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,” the company said in a statement on Oct 28. Starbucks is the latest company to shift from carrots to sticks in the ongoing return-to-office battle that has been playing out at workplaces. In September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said staff who do not support the five-day-per-week in-office policy can leave for another company. Earlier in 2024, Dell Technologies told workers who chose to remain remote that they would not be eligible for promotion, and Wall Street banks have also warned that working from home could jeopardise career prospects. Still, offices in the biggest US cities remain half empty compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. At the same time, some firms have realised that an RTO mandate can serve as layoffs in disguise. In a survey from BambooHR, one in four executives admitted they hoped for some voluntary turnover in the wake of an RTO push. Research has shown, though, that the workers who quit due to the policies are often the more experienced staff that companies can least afford to lose. Early in 2023, when Starbucks tried to enforce its hybrid-work mandate, dozens of corporate workers signed an open letter pushing back. Mr Niccol’s own work arrangement, which lets him live in California and travel 1,600km to Seattle on the company’s corporate jet, sparked backlash from some workers and outside critics. Starbucks has said that Mr Niccol will spend most of his time in Seattle or visiting stores. Some staff had said they did not care where the CEO was based, as long as he did not crack down on in-office requirements.

Title: Jeff Bezos addresses Washington Post endorsement fiasco, cites distrust in media led to 'principled decision'
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-addresses-washington-post-endorsement-fiasco-cites-distrust-media-led-principled-decision

‘MediaBuzz’ host Howard Kurtz reports on how The Washington Post is refraining from making a presidential endorsement for the first time in decades on ‘Special Report.’ Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos penned an op-ed defending the paper's "principled decision" in not endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. Bezos began the piece Monday by citing a Gallup poll showing Americans losing trust in the media, even falling below Congress, telling readers "Our profession is now the least trusted of all. Something we are doing is clearly not working." "We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement," Bezos wrote. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." WASHINGTON POST REPORTS LIBERALS ARE CANCELING SUBSCRIPTIONS OVER PAPER'S DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE VP HARRIS Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos defended the decision to stop presidential endorsements in an op-ed published on the paper's website. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON POST OWNER JEFF BEZOS WANTS MORE CONSERVATIVE OPINION WRITERS AT PAPER: REPORT The billionaire Amazon founder, who bought The Post in 2013, insisted that newspaper endorsements "do nothing to tip the scales of an election" but instead "create a perception of bias." He doubled down on The Post's decision to end its presidential endorsements by saying it's "principled decision, and it’s the right one." "By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy," Bezos conceded. Bezos denied there was any "quid pro quo" that motivated the decision and insisted the meeting the boss of his company Blue Origin had with former President Trump, which occurred the day of the announcement, was a regretful coincidence, flatly saying "There is no connection between it and our decision on presidential endorsements, and any suggestion otherwise is false." WASHINGTON POST UNION, STAFFERS REVOLT OVER DECISION NOT TO ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BLAME BEZOS The Washington Post was set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris before the move was quashed by the paper's leadership. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) He went on to suggest that his paper and other members of the legacy media are out of touch with most Americans. "The Washington Post and the New York Times win prizes, but increasingly we talk only to a certain elite. More and more, we talk to ourselves," Bezos wrote. "While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight. It’s too important. The stakes are too high. Now more than ever the world needs a credible, trusted, independent voice, and where better for that voice to originate than the capital city of the most important country in the world?" "To win this fight, we will have to exercise new muscles. Some changes will be a return to the past, and some will be new inventions. Criticism will be part and parcel of anything new, of course. This is the way of the world. None of this will be easy, but it will be worth it. I am so grateful to be part of this endeavor. Many of the finest journalists you’ll find anywhere work at The Washington Post, and they work painstakingly every day to get to the truth. They deserve to be believed," Bezos added. BEFORE NON-ENDORSEMENT DECISION, WASHINGTON POST CALLED TRUMP 'DREADFUL' AND 'WORST PRESIDENT OF MODERN TIMES' Bezos cited growing distrust in the media as the reason behind the "principled decision" for The Washington Post to end presidential endorsements. ( SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bezos' op-ed comes after The Post itself reported that the billionaire was behind the decision as the paper's CEO and publisher Will Lewis had "sought to tamp down speculation" had made the decision to help former President Trump. Meanwhile, the fallout over the decision is apparently leading The Post to pay a heavy price as NPR reported that the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper has lost more than a whopping 200,000 subscribers since Friday as liberal readers remain outraged that The Post is not endorsing Harris. Multiple members of the paper's editorial staff have also resigned. The Washington Post has been struggling the past several years. Subscriptions and revenue were in decline prior to the paper's announcement about not endorsing the presidential race, which has led to buyouts and layoffs of employees.

Starbucks Corp. is telling its corporate staff they could be fired if they don’t come to work at the office three days a week. Starting in January, Starbucks will implement a “standardized process” to hold workers accountable if they don’t abide by the coffee chain’s return-to-office policy, according to a memo sent to one of the company’s divisions that was seen by Bloomberg News. Consequences are “up to, and including, separation,” the email said. The message marks an escalation in enforcement of the company’s hybrid work rules less than two months since Brian Niccol took over as chief executive officer. He told employees last month that they should work wherever they need to in order to get their jobs done, but that he thought that place was usually the office. Starbucks said its expectations for hybrid workers hadn’t changed and that vacation, sick time and business travel are excluded from the calculation. Workers can request an exemption from the mandate due to physical, mental, sensory impairment or another disability, the company said. The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate employees. Most of the company’s workers are employed at its stores. “We are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,” the company said in a statement on Monday. Starbucks is the latest company to shift from carrots to sticks in the ongoing return-to-office battle that has been playing out at workplaces. Last month, Amazon.com Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon currently lets many of them work from home two days a week. Earlier this year, Dell Technologies told workers who chose to remain remote that they wouldn’t be eligible for promotion, and Wall Street banks have also warned that working from home could jeopardize employees’ career prospects. Still, offices in the biggest US cities remain half empty compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to security firm Kastle Systems. At the same time, some firms have realized that a return-to-office mandate can serve as layoffs in disguise. In a survey from BambooHR, one in four executives admitted they hoped for some voluntary turnover in the wake of an RTO push. Research has shown, though, that the workers who quit due to the policies are often the more experienced staffers that companies can least afford to lose. Early last year, when Starbucks tried to enforce its hybrid-work mandate, dozens of corporate workers signed an open letter pushing back. Niccol’s own work arrangement, which allows him to live in California and travel 1,000 miles to Seattle on the company’s corporate jet, sparked backlash by some workers and outside critics. Starbucks has said that Niccol will spend most of his time in Seattle or visiting stores. Several staffers had said they didn’t care where the CEO was based, as long as he didn’t crack down on in-office requirements. Starbucks is also moving away from requiring Tuesday as a common attendance day for all workers at headquarters, instead setting the expectations at a team level, according to the memo. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The Future Of Work Is At A “Stall Or Soar” Decision Point As 2025 approaches, businesses stand at a critical crossroads: Will they soar to new heights by embracing the future of work or stall in the face of emerging challenges? The last few years have been a roller-coaster ride, with a turbulent ascent into a seemingly bright future of work only to take a deep dive into the icy waters of layoffs, burnout, and disillusionment. And just when many thought the bottom had dropped out, we’re seeing faint signs of recovery — a bounce that will either propel companies forward or drag them further down. The fate of your organization depends on how you handle the critical choices coming your way. We predict big risks and opportunities for the future of working including: Whether our predictions for 2025 come true for you is up to you. As we saw in 2024, even as the EX winter got colder, companies that zigged while the rest zagged emerged far ahead of their counterparts. We know one financial services company that has the highest employee satisfaction scores it has ever seen, despite the general chilly work climate, because it invested in employees and addressed organizational concerns. Conversely, we’re working with many firms — in media, consumer products, and more — who are dealing with stagnant work cultures, general distrust in executives, and lower confidence in organizational strategy due to letting EX slide for the past year. That’s why we say that the future of work doesn’t have to be your future of work. Whether you stall or soar is up to you.

Title: Companies Have a Major Challenge Enforcing RTO Mandates

Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:51:56Z

Despite more companies issuing return-to-office (RTO) mandates, the latest challenge those companies face is enforcing them. Companies large and small have issued RTO mandates, with three days in the office becoming the accepted norm. A few, such as Amazon, have issued far stricter policies, requiring employees to be in the office five days a week. According to CBRE’s 2024 Americas Office Occupier Sentiment Survey, the vast majority of companies are failing in their efforts to enforce their office mandates. Approximately 80% of organizations have a return-to-office policy, but only 17% actively enforce these policies. This disconnect between policy and enforcement contributes to the gap between employer expectations and employee behavior: 60% want employees to work in the office three or more days per week, but only 51% of employees are in the office that frequently. Thirty-four percent of respondents anticipate closing this gap by increasing attendance. Space sharing remains top of mind to align with new utilization patterns and optimize portfolios. Interestingly, the number of companies with an RTO policy increased only slightly from 2023, going from 78% to the current 80%. Even more telling, barely more than half of companies measure compliance with their mandates, and very few enforce it. For the companies with an office attendance policy, measurement and enforcement strategies vary. Fifty-one percent of respondents with a policy report that they mandate attendance, but only about 45% measure it, and only 17% consistently enforce it. This disconnect is a factor in the continued gap between employer expectations and employee behavior. While policies are important for clarification and guidance, they are not guaranteed to drive compliance, especially without enforcement. CBRE’s findings indicate that trying to force compliance without understanding the underlying opposition will only lead to negative outcomes. At the same time, holding employees accountable to mandates can create negative outcomes if employers don’t strive to understand, and remedy, the barriers blocking more frequent office utilization. Employers who remain frustrated with lack of office utilization should explore the underlying challenge in order to deploy the right lever for change. Despite some companies’ insistence on returning to pre-pandemic norms, data increasingly shows that hybrid work is the future and RTO mandates are often disastrous. Some governments, such as the UK, are even endorsing remote work, saying companies need to stop being obsessed with a “culture of presenteeism.” Amazon is already learning this, with a recent Blind survey of 2,585 Amazon employees showing that 73% of them were considering looking for another job. Some 80% of those surveyed said they already knew of peers who were looking for another job, while 32% knew of someone who had already quit. Some Amazon employees have stated they have no intention of complying with the RTO mandate, opting to be fired instead. Trust is at the heart of the issue, and companies are reaping what they’ve sown over the last few years, beginning with the mass layoffs that hit the tech industry during the waning days of the pandemic. As we wrote then, companies were destroying the trust of their employees, something that would eventually come back to haunt them. We quoted an article by Business Insider’s Sawdah Bhaimiya. “Every time I see a notice in the news that such and such technology company has cut X percentage of their workforce, I don’t forget that,” Danny Allen, chief technology officer at software firm Veeam, told Bhaimiya at the time. “So you’re sending a message that also has a brand impact that you don’t necessarily want to be associated with. “Employees remember and people looking for jobs remember how organizations acted during the economic downturn.” Allen went on to explain exactly how the layoffs would hurt companies, with the second way being the most important in this context. “One is simply the loss of innovation, cutting resources,” said Allen. “You’re cutting your investment in future technology, that’s number one. Number two, when you cut 10% of your workforce, you’re sending the message to your employees that we care more about money than we do about you. “And employees have a long memory, so if you’re cutting people that uncertainty is very disconcerting.” Amazon is a good example of exactly the phenomenon Allen described, with many of those reluctant to return to the office citing a lack of trust in the company’s leadership, a lack of trust exacerbated by broken promises about the future of remote work. “I was not complying,” an employee named Ben said about the company’s previous three-day-a-week mandate, citing the three-hour commute he faced as the reason. “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want,” he added. That last part of Ben’s statement is critical, as doesn’t trust any sacrifice made for his job will pay off over the long haul. His sentiments were echoed by others. “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end,” an employee named Laura said after the five-day mandate. “Honestly, I’ve lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I’ve been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.” As Ben and Laura’s statements illustrate, Amazon’s leadership has lost the trust of its employees, first with mass layoffs that underscored the transience of jobs in the tech industry. Trust was further eroded by promising that some roles would remain remote or hybrid, only to then renege on those promises and demand employees return to the office, even requiring them to relocate if necessary to comply. As long as companies continue to ignore the data—which shows that remote/hybrid employees work harder and are more productive—companies will continue to struggle with efforts to force compliance with RTO mandates. Companies that do enforce them will reap the results, losing top employees and struggling to attract new talent.

Title: Dragon Age: The Veilguard Review – BioWare’s Back

Time Published: 2024-10-28T15:00:45Z

It would be the euphemism of the year to say that for BioWare, a lot is riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The once revered maker of roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age has stumbled severely with its last two games, Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem. The latest installment in the sci-fi franchise wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either, and it didn't sell as well as BioWare's parent company, Electronic Arts, wanted. The real catastrophe was Anthem, though. The new intellectual property was designed as a live service game that would be updated for ten years post-launch, but it ended up getting only a couple of patches before the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics and fans alike essentially halted that content roadmap. For a while, BioWare attempted to concoct a major overhaul (dubbed Anthem Next) that could resurrect Anthem, but EA ultimately chose to abandon the project and let the studio focus on its core franchises: Dragon Age and Mass Effect. Anthem also had a big influence on the fourth Dragon Age game. At some point, the idea was to make another live service game with coop, and reporter Jason Schreier even said the developers internally referred to it as 'Anthem with dragons.' Luckily, the magnitude of Anthem's failure, combined with the success of Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, proved to Electronic Arts that single player games could still be financially successful, convincing the publisher to allow BioWare to focus solely on the campaign and drop multiplayer altogether. By mere syllogism, one could say that Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has effectively saved the beloved Canadian studio. Many fans feared a third unsuccessful game could persuade Electronic Arts to either sell BioWare or shut it down altogether, and with 2024 proving a terrible year for layoffs and studio closures, this was a concrete possibility. Of course, what Respawn's game actually did was give BioWare a chance, which they could still have squandered. I'm happy to share, though, that they did not. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a great ride that any fan of the studio's games will be able to enjoy. The key part is that the developers successfully invested in their own strengths rather than trying to follow the latest trends even if they were out of their expertise. I'm referring specifically to the decision to abandon the open world-like zones of Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Mass Effect Andromeda) in favor of a more old-school approach, reminiscent of the earlier installments in those franchises. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to find games that do not offer open world design. Even indie developers, thanks to game-making tools like Epic's Unreal Engine, can do it relatively easily, and many publishers think of it as a definite plus for any upcoming game. It must have taken BioWare a considerable amount of convincing to get EA to approve the idea, but they did it, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard is definitely better off like this. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, as I am a big advocate of open-world games in general; however, this game proved to me that there's a place for mission-based Western RPGs going forward. For one thing, it goes a long way toward ensuring the game does not overstay its welcome, as everything is more or less connected to the story and the characters. It was not so in Inquisition, and content bloat is indeed an issue in many open world games save for the very best ones (and even those do have some side content that is just not on the same level as the rest, which developers are forced to add just to populate all the world). That is not to say Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't have relatively straightforward quests, but they are still grounded in the same narrative tissue, making them feel like part of one cohesive story. Following the few initial missions, the player navigates Thedas by accessing the world map and traveling with the Eluvians, the magical mirrors made by ancient elves that allow long-distance travel. Access to the Eluvians may come and go depending on progress (you'll have to unlock some) and story (in some cases, you must head to a specific area just for one mission, and the game will unlock the Eluvian for you). Still, some options remain available for most of the game, allowing players to revisit the same zone multiple times. It's a good thing, too, because there's actually a fair amount of exploration in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Make no mistake, this is no Elder Scrolls, and you won't find NPCs going on about their lives as in an open world game that simulates real life. Rather, BioWare chose the old-school approach first popularized by the Metroidvania genre: there's a ton of loot and secrets hidden behind puzzles and companion abilities, so you will have plenty of reason to return to exploration regions like the Arlathan Forest, Minrathous, Rivain, the Necropolis Halls, Treviso, the Hossberg Wetlands, and the Crossroads beyond just quests. If you want to make the most out of that exploration feeling, it might be a good idea to remove the mini-map, which is one of several tweaks allowed within the accessibility options. Would I have preferred more expansive zones? Sure, but they may have come at the cost of something else. Given the quality of the final game, I'm happy with the tradeoff. By the way, prepare yourselves to open countless chests and collect innumerable resources lying around, even in the most linear missions, up to the very final one. And remember: break any box or vase you see in the environments, because they will yield resources that can be used or sold to vendors. Those elements may be a bit trite, but there's a reason they have worked for decades: they make the player feel good, and that's still true to this day. Pretty much the same happens in some of the most acclaimed games of the recent past, such as Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse saga. Overall, I finished all the missions in the game (save for two particularly challenging puzzles) in 78 and a half hours, not far at all from the 80-hour mark BioWare promised in the review guide. I would say it's almost perfect for a mission-based RPG: quite meaty but about half as long as the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, which perhaps will make it more replayable. Granted, if you wish to complete it quicker, you can absolutely do it - the main path is said to be around 35 to 40 hours. One of the main areas of innovation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is in its combat system. Whereas the previous titles featured a larger party of four companions and allowed players to take direct control of the companions, this one sticks to a party of three and only lets you move around as the player character, just like in the Mass Effect series. Moreover, players have to choose three active abilities and an ultimate for their character plus three abilities per companion, whereas Inquisition featured way more selectable abilities in combat. This caused concerns among fans that the franchise's trademark tactical element would be lost or diminished. However, that's not the case at all. First and foremost, as the developers had already disclosed prior to launch, several abilities have been baked into the core moveset of each class (Warrior, Mage, and Rogue) and do not count toward that same pool of abilities. For example, the Mage can side-step attacks or Fade-step for a longer dodge by double tapping the same button; they can perform a sprint attack or a jump attack with both light and heavy attack buttons; they can charge light attacks, heavy attacks, and ranged attacks by holding the respective buttons. There are also different mechanics based on the weapon you're using, which can be switched at all times in combat: while the staff lets you create a defensive shield that is maintained as long as you have mana, the dagger and orb are more geared toward a melee type of character who must parry at the right time to be effective. Dagger and orb also have unique mechanics called Arcane Marks, which are applied to the enemy with light attacks; once you get to three hits, you apply an Arcane Bomb, which can be triggered with a heavy attack for heavy damage. This is just the very basics. Most of these attacks and moves can be augmented through gear and talents; for example, the Greater Passive downfall turns every jump attack on knocked-down foes into a critical hit. The Trait Fade Strike lets you perform a powerful follow-up attack after Fade-stepping; Imbued Defense provides the Shocking Weapons buff (+25% weapon damage) after performing a Perfect Defense, while Return Fire lets you perform a quick counterattack after the aforementioned Perfect Defense. And this is just for the core moveset; there are as many traits and passives that work on the active abilities and other aspects of your build. On that note, did I say there are also Runes? You can equip three of those at a time (though activating one sets off a shared cooldown) and they can be extremely useful depending on the situation. Examples include freezing or knocking down all nearby enemies, losing all mana to get a big heal, instantly refreshing your or your companion's ability cooldowns, greatly enhancing the efficacy of your next ability, and more. I unlocked twenty-four runes during my time with the game, and each comes with a passive and an active effect to trigger at the right time. As someone whose favorite genre is RPGs (and MMORPGs), I can safely state that Dragon Age: The Veilguard offers an impressive amount of depth in its build creation. Best of all, skill points can be refunded for free whenever outside of combat, allowing users free reign to tinker around and create their favorite build synergies with a great many options at their disposal. That includes companions, by the way, who are still very important - far more than in any Mass Effect game, I'd say, when it comes to combat. While their skill trees are not as extensive, they still offer several options that players would be wise to carefully evaluate depending on their play style. There are so many buffs and debuffs to consider, not to mention each enemy's vulnerability and resistances, which you can check at any time in combat by pausing the action and bringing up the ability wheel. That's where you can tell each companion what to do against which target, largely preserving the core tactical element of Dragon Age. It may be different on the lower difficulties, but when playing on Underdog (the second-toughest difficulty after Nightmare, which, however, locks you into that difficulty when beginning a playthrough), pausing the action to think about what to do and properly order the companions around was instrumental to say the least, especially to set up the detonation combos, which work by applying and then triggering an effect like Weakened, Sundered, or Overwhelmed on a target. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is no Dark Souls, but its encounter design is excellent and it offers a worthy challenge even to experienced action and RPG players. There are some fantastic boss fights in the game, both in terms of spectacle and mechanics, forcing you to grow your character and perhaps change your build a bit, as well as learn how to counter the boss's moves as in any great action game. There is a bit of a catch in that companions do not actually take damage - they are effectively invulnerable in combat. That said, enemies do attack them from time to time, and two of them offer specific taunt abilities to get the attention off you (there's also a Rune that diverts enemies to the rest of the party for a short while). This may irk those who yearn for realistic fights, but in practice, it did not bother me at all. The game was clearly designed around this limitation (probably because they wanted to avoid the issue where they died all the time and forced the player to revive them over and over again) and I did not feel it negatively impacted Veilguard. In fact, the changes made compared to Inquisition's middling combat are almost entirely for the better. Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an outstanding combat system that finds the perfect balance between action and tactics, giving it a unique identity in the RPG genre. BioWare's games have always been narrative-driven, and this one is no exception. The game follows directly on the events seen in Inquisition and its Trespasser DLC with a ten-year gap (just like in real life), and it can be considered the culmination of storylines that have been in motion for a long time in the series. Dragon Age lore aficionados will find several earth-shattering revelations that answer some long-standing questions. Effectively, this game closes one chapter of the overarching world narrative, and the next installment will inevitably have to be centered around different themes and characters. For this reason, those who played previous installments and know about the lore will get the most enjoyment, although it is not a barrier to newcomers. While creating the player character (the character creator is very robust, although not the most complex I've seen in a game), the game also lets you create the Inquisitor, the protagonist of the previous game, and choose how a few key events from Inquisition unfolded. Having choices and consequences reverberate throughout their games has also characterized the studio's previous work, especially in Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Again, Veilguard does not disappoint in this area, either. Early on, there will be a major decision to make: the villains are attacking two cities at once, and you cannot be there for both. Each city is tied to one of the companions, and the 'forgotten' city and companion will be transformed in a way. The companion will become ineligible for some time as they deal with the fallout, and when they come back, they will be 'hardened', empowering their damage abilities while closing down their healing ones as they are now hellbent on vengeance. This is an interesting system, both narratively and mechanically, so it's a shame that it does not seem to apply to the other companions as well. Other than that, you will guide the companions in their personal quests through harrowing times of acceptance and personal struggles, with companion quests ranging from relaxed hangouts to sprawling missions that lead to complex boss fights. Seeing a companion through the entire personal quest is not only fulfilling from a storyline perspective, it will also allow you to maximize the bond with them, level them up, and elevate them to Hero of the Veilguard, a status that empowers their abilities and makes them more likely to survive the final fight. That's really where most of the choices and efforts made throughout the whole game come to fruition. Allowing each of the companions to solve their conflicts and each of the factions to be as strong as possible is a big factor in attaining the best possible ending, although there are some choices to make even in the final fight, such as sending the right companion to accomplish a certain task. Overall, the writing in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is great, and the voiceover and tech improvements (mainly facial animations, eyes, and the amazing hair) also help a great deal with the presentation. Just do not expect to act as a villain or even just drive away companions. While in some instances a certain dialogue option led to a companion disapproving, those were so far and few between to not actually matter. This is not that kind of RPG - you're supposed to be a hero. Companions can be befriended and romanced, as in most previous BioWare titles. In my experience, the romance was a slow but steady buildup, though that may depend on the character, and it's fine by itself since it felt good when it finally happened. There's practically no nudity to speak of, anyway, so if you were hoping for steamy sex scenes like in Baldur's Gate 3, you're out of luck. Also, a minor criticism regarding cutscenes is that most of the time, companions do not intervene when talking to other NPCs, even when it would be entirely appropriate for them to do so (for instance, when talking with the leaders of the resistance of their city of provenance). Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield, on the other hand, featured a lot of instances where companions interjected, making conversations feel more lively and realistic. Granted, there's still a lot of great banter between companions themselves, and you won't miss on any of that just because you've suddenly entered combat - they are now smart enough to resume that talk once things have settled down. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs on the Frostbite engine, just like the last three games made by the studio. Much has been written on the hardships encountered by the BioWare developers as they attempted to tame an engine originally made for shooter games. In the lead-up to the release, the developers mentioned that they had finally learned how to best use Frostbite. That may be the case, but the performance is honestly underwhelming. I played on a PC with nearly the best combination of CPU and GPU one money can buy (an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090), and yet I had to deal with considerable stuttering throughout it all. That's even with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (upscaling from 1080p to 4K) and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, not to mention the optimized Game Ready driver installed. The only way to reduce those stutters was to essentially remove ray tracing, or rather, switch to the 'RT Selective' option, which only applies ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion to specific areas of the game that best showcase the respective effects. Even so, they were not eliminated and occurred regularly. Those were not shader stutters, by the way. The game compiles shaders the first time you launch it, recompiles them if you change drivers, and verifies them anyway each time before loading the menu. They had to be traversal stutters, as we're used to seeing with Unreal Engine games. However, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks good, it doesn't compare to the latest triple-A Unreal Engine releases. Honestly, it might be worth it for EA to allow BioWare to use Unreal Engine, just like Respawn, going forward. I also had to contend with a bug for my whole playthrough: when launching the game with HDR enabled and DLSS Frame Generation enabled, there were flickering skies until I turned off and then on again DLSS FG. On the upside, HDR was well implemented, which is unfortunately rare. From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal. Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher). With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere, stocks in Japan rallied after the country's ruling party failed to hold onto its majority in elections on Sunday — underscoring political risks to markets with the US presidential vote just days away. Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

Tel Aviv’s attack against Iranian military facilities early Saturday were in response to Tehran’s missile strikes on October 1. Oil was volatile in the weeks preceding the retaliation with Brent touching $80 per barrel as traders speculated whether Israel would strike against Iran’s oil infrastructure. The White House advised against targeting the country's oil or nuclear facilities. Sign in to access your portfolio

Business Alphabet will likely post its slowest revenue growth in four quarters on Tuesday, hurt by competition that weighed on its core Google Search business and dented YouTube ad spending. The slowdown in its core business is expected to overshadow AI-driven gains at its cloud-computing business in the third quarter. This quarter was also the company's first since Anat Ashkenazi took over as finance chief from Ruth Porat. Alphabet's long-established dominance of the digital ad market is under threat from the likes of Amazon and TikTok that have become popular with advertisers looking to tap a ready pool of buyers. The other risk Alphabet faces is from regulators who are considering breaking up Google to loosen what they call its "illegal monopoly" on online search. Analysts expect Google Search and other related revenue to grow 11.6 per cent in the third quarter, slower than the 13.8 per cent increase in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha. "New entrants like Perplexity and ChatGPT are raising billions of dollars on the premise that search can now be disrupted; Google has been seen as slow, unprepared ... to the development of GenAI," MoffettNathanson analysts said. "Some of this negative narrative will be hard to disprove in the coming year," the analysts said, adding that they expect significant changes in Google's ability to maintain its exclusive search advantage on Apple and Android phones in the United States. In a report earlier this month that raised alarm bells among investors, research firm eMarketer said Google's share of U.S. search advertising revenue was set to fall below 50 per cent next year for the first time in at least 18 years. Amazon's search advertising revenue share in the U.S. is expected to grow to 24 per cent next year, while generative AI rivals such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI are also snatching some ad dollars from Google. Google is working to improve the effectiveness of its tools. It has started showing ads in the AI-generated summaries it has begun placing at the top of search results, a move that analysts believe may help stave off competition. Alphabet's shares fell nearly 9 per cent in the three months to September, marking their largest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2022. But they have risen 17 per cent so far this year. Overall, Alphabet's revenue is expected to have increased 12.6 per cent in the third quarter to $86.31 billion, slower than the 13.6 per cent growth in the second quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. YouTube is also expected to have suffered from some marketers shifting spending to ad-supported tiers of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. YouTube revenue likely rose 11.5 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the second quarter. Despite the deceleration, analysts from Truist expect YouTube, especially YouTube TV, to have benefited from a boost in political ad spending in the third quarter. Google Cloud, a bright spot, is set to record faster growth of 29.2 per cent, the biggest jump in seven quarters, as customers increased their spending on its AI services, including the Vertex AI platform that allows businesses to use the company's models as well as develop their own custom models. Alphabet warned in July that capital expenses would remain high this year as it invested in AI to keep up with rivals. Google's cloud peers have also flagged higher capital expenditures as they too rush to enhance their offerings with AI. Amazon's cloud business revenue likely rose 19.3 per cent in the September quarter, while revenue from Microsoft's cloud unit is expected to have risen around 11 per cent. Investors will look for what Chief Financial Officer Ashkenazi does to keep other costs in check. BofA analysts said with her appointment, there was "potential for the company to 'surprise' with further self-help cost cutting actions after limited layoffs in 2024."
