As stores first cautiously reopened, here's how work has changed in the years since. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Do you remember where you were on March 11, 2020? Five years ago today, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic, sending workers home from the office and shuttering businesses worldwide. Since then, we’ve experienced a shifting job market, expectations and locations. What began as an employee-friendly job market amid “The Great Resignation” has turned into one where employers are holding the purse strings and workers are feeling as unmotivated as ever. This uncertainty has led to the rise of “The Great Detachment,” what experts are calling this period of falling employee engagement, satisfaction and choice. At its core is “the manager squeeze,” says Jim Harter, chief scientist of workplace management and well-being at Gallup, who just published an analysis of the last five years. “How people are managed on a daily basis is multiples more important” than hybrid work policies, he says. “The role of first leadership is saying ‘here’s the culture that we want, and here’s how our practices are going to reinforce that culture that we want,’ and then to articulate it in a way that’s clear to employees.” But how to do that when many folks have been forced to do more with less? Managers seem to have gotten the short end of the stick on both ends of the corporate ladder, as they are tasked with carrying on in “the year of efficiency” while also lacking the training and support to coach their direct reports. This is not only impacting performance and productivity rates (though productivity rebounded at the end of 2024), but such work cultures can be counterproductive to the motto of efficiency. “Efficiency becomes more of an uphill battle when folks aren’t in predictable places,” whether that be financially or physically, says Harter. Such uncertainty is one of the reasons engagement rates have plummeted in the last year (read more below on how we arrived at The Great Detachment). Yes, it’s a bleak mark for the state of work in 2025, but Harter is optimistic that it doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom––there are still employers out there who are beating the trend. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter If you are one of the government workers impacted by DOGE cuts, here’s what you need to know about the private sector. Spring is near and it may just be the best time to interview and land a new job. If you’ve recently been laid off, here’s why COBRA could be the cheapest health insurance option. Beware of these 10 overused marketing phrases and try these instead. New reports from Glassdoor, LinkedIn and Gallup all point to one staggering, if depressing, conclusion about the American workforce: Confidence and satisfaction is at an all-time low. How did we get here? Shot of a young businessman looking bored while working at his desk during late night at work It’s a bleak time to be an American worker. Between the fear of layoffs, lack of engagement and confidence in their own employment, employees in the U.S. are feeling less motivated than ever. For one, the job market is incredibly competitive. It’s taking most job seekers over six months to find a new position, according to LinkedIn, and economic uncertainty coupled with fast-changing federal regulations is making workers lack a sense of job security. The fear of layoffs is a major factor in this job security anxiety. Glassdoor’s monthly employee confidence index hit an all-time low in February, dropping to levels not seen since the company started tracking it in 2016. Mentions of layoffs in company reviews are up 5% from last February, the highest Glassdoor has seen since July 2020, when the pandemic had seemingly no end in sight. So why is this happening? According to Gallup’s Jim Harter, it’s likely because of a serious shift in change management. While employers were celebrated by their workers for clearly and transparently communicating changes during the pandemic, that communication changed during the Great Resignation of 2021. “Leadership took their eye off the ball in terms of really thinking holistically about what they want as an organization. Some people are saying, ‘Well, for us to have a culture, we need to be in the office,’” Harter says. “But when you’re taking that autonomy away from people, it stings a bit. So you’ve gotta have really clear communication with them about the why.” It all builds up: Without clear communication, employees are more likely to feel like they do not align with the company’s vision and that their work doesn’t matter, increasing the detachment and feelings of not being engaged. And it’s not temporary. Employers should be keeping the workforce engaged even when the market is in their favor. “During the pandemic to some extent, people remembered how they were treated, and then they acted on it when they had a choice by leaving” Harter adds. So while workers largely feel stuck today, it doesn’t mean they won’t leave should a better choice come along. News from the world of work Fixing AI’s wrong answers is the newest side hustle for American college graduates, reports Forbes’ Richard Nieva. AI data labeling platform Scale AI is increasingly contracting American workers, including MFA and Ph.D. grads, to train its AI models. But it’s not all smooth sailing: The Department of Labor is investigating the Nvidia and Amazon-backed startup over its labor practices. Microsoft-backed HR tech platform Darwinbox recently announced an influx of funding last week. The Indian company, last valued at $1 billion, raised $150 million from private equity firm KKR and Switzerland’s Partners Group, which it says will be used to expand its mobile-first and AI-powered human capital product. The United States added just 151,000 jobs in February, well below analysts’ estimates and the weakest February growth since 2019. Unemployment rose to 4.1%, as government workers lost their jobs due to DOGE-led cuts. Harvard and MIT announced last week they’d be pausing hiring across their staffs because of President Donald Trump’s shifting policies and the uncertainty around federal funding. The news comes just a few days after the federal government pulled $400 million in funding from Columbia University and is investigating 60 schools over campus protests. Retailers have been one of the hardest-hit industries by this year’s economic uncertainty––they’ve lost 6,300 jobs from January, according to the latest BLS report, with over 45,000 announced layoffs still to come. Beyond the threat of tariffs, corporate bankruptcies from the likes of Joann and Party City drove the job cuts. Prosecutors are now accusing Sean “Diddy” Combs of forced labor in a new indictment, alleging the hip-hop mogul used physical and psychological threats to maintain control over his employees. These accusations are on top of the several charges of sex trafficking and racketeering.

Title: Economic Boycotts: How Small Businesses Can Benefit

ByAllyson Kapin ByAllyson Kapin , Contributor. SAUSALITO, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 28: An aerial view of the parking lot at a Target store on February ... [+] 28, 2025 in Sausalito, California. The People's Union USA, a grassroots group, is calling for an "economic boycott" on Friday and is urging Americans not to shop for 24 hours. The boycott follows a rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at several companies. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Ten days after the 24-hour consumer blackout called by The People’s Union USA, all eyes are on retail giants Target and Amazon. While the boycott increased public awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks, the numbers aren’t telling us much. That said, we might be missing the bigger picture, especially when it comes to what this all means for small businesses. While in-person traffic to Target’s physical stores and time spent on its mobile app saw measurable decreases during the one-day consumer blackout, they weren’t substantial enough to make a permanent dent. It’s also worth noting that Target has lost something north of $12 billion, according to its statements. That tracks with a considerable brand reputation nosedive since 2023 before it cut its DEI programs. That the company has downgraded its sales forecast to remain flat through 2026 is not nothing. There’s good reason to believe that their next earnings report covering the current climate and at the center of the latest 40-day boycott organized by Black faith leaders – will paint a substantially less ambiguous picture. With Black consumers having $2 trillion in buying power, this boycott could be the lightning rod that sparks a much wider movement. Feb. 28 was neither a one-off nor a Hail Mary. It was a capacity-building exercise. It gave supporters a taste of being a part of what organizing feels like and how to support local and independent businesses. Furthermore, it allowed boycott organizers to capture a growing base of consumers who feel increasingly frustrated that corporate America is abandoning them and their values. It bolstered faith leaders and unions' power to harness this energy into targeted and more sustained boycotts that have a formidable history of forcing demands through organized economic activity. We tend to understand that history in terms of what people didn’t do, or (more accurately) refused to do. Where they refused to spend their money or activities they refused to take part in. Therefore, any reasonable small business might extrapolate a sort of warning. No doubt, the trials of Target loom large for smaller enterprises trying to weather this minefield moment in American history. Here’s the thing: Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection – a reallocation of spending power. Most people know Rosa Parks and her role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses is unconstitutional. What helped sustain the boycott for so long? Small businesses. Many Black-owned taxi companies stepped in to provide rides at the cost of bus fare, allowing Black residents to maintain the boycott. There is power in numbers and networks. There are 33 million small businesses in the U.S. that employ over 61 million Americans, according to the Small Business Administration. And 82% of consumers say they prefer to spend their money on brands and businesses that align with their values. Small businesses have a huge opportunity to seize this moment and lean hard into their values and commitments to creating more space for different voices, thoughts, and ideas —creating a stronger, richer quilt that’s more multifaceted, said James. That is the heart of DEI. For example, small businesses can join “The Fifteen Percent Pledge,” a commitment to reserve 15% of shelf space for Black-owned businesses. Small businesses in areas where there are large government layoffs can consider offering discounts to those who are unemployed. In Washington, DC mobile mechanic groups like Roda are offering 30% off services for affected federal employees. Small businesses can also play an instrumental role in building important networks. Some local coffee shops in DC, Maryland, and Virginia are offering free coffee to those impacted by layoffs and a designated spot and time to meet up for weekly networking. This is also a time to get creative with specialized product lines that show your solidarity in these tumultuous times. For example, before Trump’s inauguration, Penzeys Spices, a company located in over 20 states with over 200 employees, created a specialty pack of Resist! Seasoning. The company sent a box of the Resist! Seasoning packets to customers to share with neighbors. They also did a promotion in honor of the victims of January 6th where for every purchase of the specialty seasoning, Penzey’s would donate a box where they "think it will do good." The operative question is not how small businesses can survive this shifting landscape – it’s whether they will seize the opportunity it presents. Our present moment, however fraught, needn’t be a matter of dodging punches. It can be a case of getting back to basics. Like supply and demand.

Title: Pragma raises $12.75M for backend game engine for live services games
URL: https://venturebeat.com/games/pragma-raises-12-75m-for-backend-game-engine-for-live-services-games/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T14:00:00Z

Pragma, a backend game engine empowering studios to build scalable, live-service games, said it has raised $12.75 million in strategic funding raising. Pragma‘s funding included participation from the industry’s top venture firms and Square Enix, a global leader in game publishing and development. The new investment brings the company’s total funds raised to over $50 million. Los Angeles-based Pragma was founded by engineering veterans who built platforms for some of the largest live service games, including League of Legends and Destiny 2. The Pragma engine powers matchmaking, analytics, monetization, player data, and more, allowing developers to hone their creativity toward building games while offloading the complexity of building a stable multiplayer game infrastructure. Studios like Gardens Interactive, People Can Fly, Frost Giant Studios, Square Enix External Studios and more use Pragma to power their games. “This investment aligns with our commitment to support innovation and excellence in the gaming industry,” said Hideaki Uehara, general manager of investment and business development at Square Enix Holdings, in a statement. “Pragma’s cutting-edge solutions deliver seamless and scalable gaming experiences. We believe this collaboration will drive significant growth and innovation, benefiting both our company and the broader gaming community.” This investment marks a major milestone for Pragma and reinforces the ongoing success of Pragma’s mission to provide studios with the most robust and flexible game backend infrastructure. With this strategic round of investment, Pragma will further deepen its suite of live-service tools and services and allow for strategic M&A activity as needed. Further, Square Enix’s investment gives them strategic access to Pragma’s technical expertise. “Square Enix is renowned for delivering immersive, high-quality gaming experiences, and their investment is a testament to the strength of our technology and vision,” said Eden Chen, CEO of Pragma, in a statement. “This partnership enables us to accelerate product development that will allow for customers to get their game online cheaper and faster, at scale, with better tools for growing community and retaining their players.” With the addition of the recently acquired FirstLook player engagement platform, Pragma now serves both the back-end and player front-end of launching any online game. Since FirstLook’s launch in 2024, the company has helped onboard over 100,000 playtesters, facilitated 100+ playtest events, and supported 30 Discord communities. Developers already using Pragma will be able to use FirstLook’s latest integration features, including the ability to reward entitlements to players and manage limited-access events seamlessly. Pragma has helped build some of the biggest video games and distributed systems in the world at Riot Games, PopCap, Google, Amazon, and EA for games like League of Legends, Valorant, Fortnite, Destiny 2, and Eve Online. Other investors include Upfront Ventures, Greylock Partners and Insight Partners. Pragma has more than 50 employees. It was founded in 2020 by Eden Chen and Chris Cobb. Prior to founding Pragma, Chen founded Fishermen Labs which built VR/XR and other tech solutions for some of the biggest tech companies including Snap, Meta and more. Eden is one of the top active angel investors and advisors in the games industry, investing in over 80-plus game studios and game tech in the last five years. Prior to founding Pragma, Cobb was a backend tech lead at Riot Games where he shipped a patented matchmaking system that enabled seamless, competitive matches for tens of millions of League of Legends players worldwide. Cobb also built and led the player behavior team, and Cobb was also CEO of Bot School before its acquisition by Phoenix Labs and has shipped many other successful online games throughout his career, including Dauntless, Bejeweled Blitz, Plants vs Zombies and many more. As for the inspiration, Chen and Cobb had had firsthand experience building live-service infrastructures for huge titles like League of Legends and Destiny 2. They realized that studios were rebuilding complex backend infrastructure every time they ship a game, so they started building tools to help studios focus on the most important things (building a great game), saving them time and money. In light of recent macroeconomic challenges including increased game budgets and related layoffs, Pragma was developed to help reduce the massive upfront costs that go into online game development without sacrificing quality, reliability and flexibility. Pragma democratizes the process of developing games by building a robust, modular backend platform. The engine allows developers to launch online-enabled experiences without massive engineering teams, giving developers more time to focus on the creative side of game development and offloading the complexities of backend development. Their founding thesis has proved correct: last year, there were 18,927 games released on Steam, and 2025 looks like it will increase on that. With numerous studios continuing to lay off incredible developers — a number of which have struck out to make their own games and IP, the market continues to grow. And many of these folks are traditionally game makers–not engineers–with Pragma here to ensure they have all their online services needs met, right out of the box. PlayFab is the main competitor in the space. PlayFab was founded back in 2014, and the focus was primarily on casual mobile games; eventually sold to Microsoft in 2018. Since then, online service games have dramatically increased in complexity (e.g. cross platform PC/Console and battle royales weren’t even a thing back then) and no other backend product has kept up with the evolution and development needs of these games. Most companies in the space provide a basic toolset to get a game online, but Pragma said it is the only company that offers a fully customizable backend game engine with a suite of tools that give studios the flexibility to bring their game online. Pragma powers matchmaking, content management, live operations, and more, offering a developer-friendly system designed for long-term flexibility and growth of a game. Plus, Pragma’s recent acquisition of FirstLook now offers studios a complete solution for game development. Pragma helps studios (like Dreamhaven, Stoke Games, and Night Street, 30+ in two months) get games online, and FirstLook helps developers engage with and grow their player communities, leading to more successful game launches. Some of the games using Pragma include Spectre Divide, Predecessor, Stormgate, and Gardens’ upcoming flagship fantasy adventure game. Recently, Pragma helped power the early access launch of Seekers of Skyveil, created by ex-Riot developers David Banks and Christina Norman. Stay in the know!

Title: DOGE deploys AI chatbot at GSA amid workforce reductions
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3842906/doge-deploys-ai-chatbot-at-gsa-amid-workforce-reductions.html
Time Published: 2025-03-11T11:45:34Z
Full Content:
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), backed by Elon Musk, has expanded the deployment of its custom AI-powered chatbot, GSAi, to approximately 1,500 government workers at the General Services Administration. The move signals a push for AI-driven efficiencies amid widespread layoffs, raising concerns over the use of automation to justify job cuts. Following a February pilot program that granted access to about 150 GSA employees, the department has rapidly expanded the chatbot’s availability, reported Wired. Quoting sources, Wired reported that while the AI tool has been in development for months, DOGE has significantly accelerated its deployment timeline and been fine-tuned specifically for government use. The GSAi system operates through a ChatGPT-like interface and leverages multiple AI models, including Anthropic’s Claude Haiku 3.5, Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2, and Meta’s LLaMa 3.2, selecting different models based on the specific task requirements, the report added. Despite its capabilities, initial feedback suggests it offers “generic and guessable answers” and functions “about as good as an intern.” An internal memo reviewed by Wired instructs employees to use GSAi for tasks such as drafting emails, creating talking points, summarizing documents, and writing basic code. However, strict guidelines prohibit entering non-public government information, personal data, or confidential work products, limiting its scope for more sensitive tasks. While its current functions are relatively basic, DOGE aims to expand GSAi’s role in federal operations. Future applications could include contract analysis, procurement data management, and other government workflow optimizations. This aligns with DOGE’s broader vision of leveraging AI to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. “AI-driven automation like GSAi can be a viable solution for improving government efficiency, provided it is implemented with careful consideration of the need for human oversight in critical functions,” said Charlie Dai, VP, principal analyst at Forrester. “By adopting a balanced and thoughtful approach, governments can harness the benefits of AI while safeguarding the essential human elements that ensure accountability, ethics, and public trust.” DOGE’s layoffs have been extensive. Last month, over 1,000 GSA employees were abruptly dismissed, and the agency has plans to reduce its Public Building Service staff by 63%. Additionally, DOGE has shuttered GSA’s technology consulting unit, 18F, which housed nearly 100 tech specialists focused on digital modernization. Critics argue that deploying AI tools like GSAi serves to rationalize the mass firings, presenting AI as a means to maintain efficiency with a reduced workforce. Musk and co-leader Vivek Ramaswamy have previously advocated for a streamlined government, stating in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that DOGE aims to build a “lean team” of legal and technology experts. Several former employees of Musk’s various technology companies have reportedly joined DOGE, further fueling speculation that the agency is shifting towards a more Silicon Valley-style operational model, prioritizing automation over human expertise. However, DOGE’s rapid rollout of AI raises concerns compared to other government-led digital transformation efforts worldwide. “DOGE’s approach is characterized by its rapid deployment, cost-cutting focus, and ambitious goals,” Dai added. “However, it lacks the careful planning, ethical considerations, and public trust-building seen in other global efforts.” He cautioned that without a more balanced approach combining innovation with accountability, the agency risks repeating past mistakes and undermining the efficiency it seeks to achieve. Established through an executive order, DOGE replaces the US Digital Service (USDS) and has been tasked with modernizing federal technology. However, former USDS employees have criticized DOGE’s direction, accusing Musk and his allies of undermining the agency’s original mission and politicizing its operations. USDS was originally a nonpartisan initiative that recruited top talent from tech giants like Amazon and Google for short-term government service. The agency played a crucial role in improving services at the Social Security Administration, Veterans Affairs, and other federal institutions. While DOGE insists on increasing government efficiency through technology, its aggressive cost-cutting measures and reliance on AI have fueled concerns over job security and the effectiveness of AI-driven governance. Whether GSAi proves to be a breakthrough in public sector technology or a cover for workforce reductions remains to be seen. The implications of DOGE’s strategy could redefine how AI is integrated into government operations, setting a precedent for automation-led reforms in the public sector.

Title: Everyone is a loser in the Apple Intelligence race

AAPL: 215.98 ( 4.86 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. There's a lot of AI out there, but picking winners and losers isn't that simple Apple Intelligence is seemingly being lapped in the AI race, but it's hard to determine who's really winning when the competitors change the victory condition every few laps. Humans are a tribal species that thrives on competition and debate, and it's no different when it comes to technology. Whether you're talking about Android versus iPhone or PlayStation versus Xbox, people love to pick sides. It's no different for the various artificial intelligence systems available. However, almost universally, it seems people and pundits are calling Apple Intelligence the biggest loser — even when compared to systems that haven't released yet. I remember when this whole "Artificial Intelligence" thing started. It was and still is a bad name for an evolution of technology that has nothing to do with computers knowing anything. Intelligence is literally defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge or skills. Artificial Intelligence does neither. The so-called "artificial intelligence" is just a brute-force technology that works best when it has access to mass amounts of data stolen by mostly large corporations from the web. It can't think, it can't reason, and it doesn't have knowledge — it has access to knowledge. It then parses that knowledge into a soup that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn't. But it does it so confidently, that Google likes to put it forth as gospel, eager for people to scoop up, right or wrong, credited or not. It's impossible to win a race with a moving finish lineI'll say it up front in case anyone is confused. I'm not here to defend Apple's current state in Apple Intelligence. Let's be frank — Apple's position isn't ideal, and I'm not going to try and convince anyone it's getting an unfair bad rap. It deserves the criticism it gets. Apple Image Playground Sketch style (left) and ChatGPT via Siri interpreting that (right)There is a narrative going around that Apple wasn't even thinking of this technology until pressure mounted in late 2023. While it is possible Apple wasn't targeting a 2024 release, I doubt they completely missed that ChatGPT and Google Bard were part of a zeitgeist. Apple has been working on computational photography for many iPhone generations, from the bokeh effect introduced with iPhone 7's dual cameras to the intensive camera systems on iPhone 16 Pro Max. These advancements in iPhone photography necessitated a new chipset that would take the load off of the GPU — the Neural Engine. The Neural Engine debuted in the iPhone 8 with the A11 Bionic. While no one was calling these advanced models "AI" at the time, it was the foundation of the technology we use today. OpenAI began research for generative AI models in 2016, which is when Apple, Google, and Qualcomm also announced similar research projects. Apple revealed it was researching AI in December 2016, revealed the Neural Engine in 2017, then ChatGPT was released in 2022, and Apple Intelligence in 2024. That doesn't mean Apple didn't already have so-called AI before Apple Intelligence. A lot of early AI wasn't even generative. Google and others were waltzing on stage talking about AI when the technology they showed wasn't fundamentally different from the advanced ML used on iPhone at the time. Apple wasn't behind on AI in 2016, 2022, or 2024, it's been in the game since it started work on Project Titan in approximately 2015. For those that have already forgotten, Apple had always planned on it being an autonomous driving unit with AI. Apple Car wasn't going to drive itself without AIIncreasing pressure to announce something, anything related to AI in 2023, seemingly forced Apple's hand. It can be seen in how the company talked about AI before WWDC 2024. The executives even went out of their way to avoid saying AI to the point it was a running joke in the tech community. Then suddenly, everyone at Apple was saying "AI." An internal adjustment occurred as they came up with their strategy on the fly. Market pressures from the stockholders, customers, and global influences forced Apple to come to the uncomfortable conclusion that the iOS cycle they had planned wasn't going to work. Apple Intelligence had to be revealed in June or the company would face incredible pushback. Without AI, Apple was "behind" and people would turn to competitors that offered access to this new popular technology. Let's not forget that at the time the existing models were doing little more than producing wild hallucinations and poorly conceived student essays. Even so, Google and OpenAI were promising a technology so grand and dangerous it could destroy humanity, eliminate all work, and collapse economies. Ah yes, glue on pizza. AI is a world-threatening cataclysm indeed.While this Skynet level of AI never showed up, people ate up the idea, and Apple wasn't part of the conversation. Tech folk kept repeating the lie that AI was changing the world and Apple wasn't going to be part of the revolution. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are hammers, not self-aware computers. They help with very specific situations and make some really cool stuff. I can't help but be in awe at some of the generated images and videos. Interacting with a chatbot can be entertaining and unique, like talking to a video game. Zork writ large. There are people out there producing some really interesting stuff thanks to AI. When the technology is applied to science, research, analysis, and other academic or enterprise uses, it can do amazing things. But let's not fool ourselves. It is already having a detrimental effect on the internet. AI may not kill humanity directly, but it will kill the internetThe real threat of AI from companies like Google and ChatGPT is the death of the information industry as a whole. Google started life with a goal to organize the world's information, now it is using that access to eliminate the need for the web outside of Google search results. No need for websites when everything is accomplished in the search barIt's thanks to companies like Google that we have a web built around ads and tracking users. That ad system pays the bills for publications so information can be researched, written about, published, then indexed by Google. Google has broken that cycle of trust many times over the years. It first did it by boiling the frog, gradually taking more of this revenue for itself, squeezing out everybody else. This has already forced the closure of many, many enthusiast sites, and several AppleInsider employees are refugees from that. It is doing it now by amalgamating several results from multiple sites into one AI summary. It now leads most searches with that, accuracy, accreditation, and payment be damned. Inevitably, the AI will increasingly feed on AI-generated content. This closed feedback loop reinforces specific ideas, eliminates human publication, and ultimately creates a web where the only place you can get any information is from trillion-dollar companies. AI works better as a tool for humans, not a tool that replaces humansThe only way out of this mess is to stop treating AI like some kind of all-knowing tool that replaces human work. It can accelerate and enhance work done by humans, but it will never replace it. Apple could face a similar dilemma with Apple Intelligence as app intents and LLM Siri are finally rolled out. If users can get all of the information they need via voice interactions with Siri, there won't be much point for opening the app itself. Developers with sprawling UI elements and beautiful design could lose ground to utilitarian single-screen apps that interact solely through generative AI. Apple's on-device systems will be front and center, benefiting from developer's hard work, but without good ways to monetize apps beyond active service subscriptions. All of these companies have a responsibility to think about how the changes brought about by AI will affect incomes the world over. Hopefully they'll all realize that AI can be dialed back in some respects to ensure humanity can still shine through, whether it's via human-written articles or app UI. Apple Intelligence is good, actuallyWhen Apple finally revealed Apple Intelligence, I was excited by everything they shared. It was on-device, private, secure, and not actively training on user data. Apple Intelligence is useful, personal, and private unlike other AI toolsApple's AI tools were smart, if boring. Rather than promise lies like a thinking computer, Apple gave us generative autocorrect, writing tools, and system-wide summaries. Image Playground was and is a terrible attempt at competing on that front. It was somewhat excusable during the beta cycle, but nothing has changed since that bad superhero Mom example during WWDC, and that's not sustainable when competitors release new versions constantly. Though, I do think Image Playground needed to release to help see how users would take advantage of the model, kind of like Animoji or Memoji. It acted as a working example of Apple Intelligence in something more tangible than grammar checks. But yes, the images it makes are terrible if not horrific. Genmoji is neat and useful though. Using ChatGPT via Siri eliminates privacy and data harvesting concernsApple even tied ChatGPT into Siri and its Apple Intelligence tools, but in a smart way that ensures user privacy. The implementation isn't dissimilar to how Siri calls out to Google privately to conduct a search. Of course, none of this mattered because the doom patrol was out in force to say how behind Apple was. Sure, it couldn't make a Pixar-grade image from a prompt, but the other tools were useful and most importantly, built into the devices they already owned. From the September release to today, many people have discussed just how far behind Apple is in this AI race. I think it comes down to a perception issue. Outwardly, Apple is behind. Why is anybody's guess. Version after version of increasingly small gains in AI. Image source: OpenAIApple isn't shipping new, obtusely named models every week with granular improvements and made-up new milestones. The executives aren't promising to end humanity's need for work. Apple is doing what it does best — working internally until something is ready, then releasing. In fact, Apple Intelligence might be one of the few examples of Apple releasing something before it was ready. My guess is that they had planned to announce all this at WWDC 2025, and we'd have gotten a more polished version of what we have today this fall. Instead, Apple has been trying to get something new to say about Apple Intelligence with every iOS 18 release. It's all been done in the name of playing catch-up with competitors that aren't even following the rules of their own race. They invent new terms and new goalposts to celebrate empty victories at every turn. It's all very disingenuous, and AI fatigue has already set in. I ask everyone all the time, here, in the AppleInsider Podcast, among friends and family, and even just people I'm conversing with in public - "what have you done with AI?" Really think about it. People don't know what AI is for or what it can do for them, just that it's supposed to be good and Apple is behind. "It's Brawndo, it's got electrolytes." The increasingly accurate film/future documentary, 'Idiocracy' had everyone talking about electrolytes. Image source: 'Idiocracy'I've tinkered with AI from other companies, and they're interesting, but I've not found anything that'll help me directly. To be fair, I'm not exactly the target audience for many of the offered tools. I'm not coding with GitHub Copilot or flooding the internet with slop images and articles in an attempt to make pennies in ad revenue. I am writing, though, and I am using Apple products. So, the only AI that's made any difference in my life is actually Apple Intelligence. It's not huge, and I'm not yelling from the rooftops or anything, but it is a difference. But that's okay, because it is having a positive effect in my workflows without sacrificing anything, and that's what good technology is about. It doesn't always have to be a big deal. Summaries on notifications and mail, even when wrong, are useful for triage. Instead of getting a Slack notification that's so long it ends in an ellipsis, I just get the gist in a summary. Mail summaries are incredibly usefulWe're awash with email here at AppleInsider. Hundreds if not thousands a day. I can see what the actual point of whatever random email I get without opening it. Apple Home isn't packing my notifications thanks to grouping and summaries. Writing tools have replaced Grammarly, a $150 per year subscription. And, for what it's worth, Grammarly got worse when it implemented artificial intelligence. I can take a screenshot of a table on a website, ask Siri to send it to ChatGPT, and give me the HTML version of that table, and get it. It still needs to be deeply proofread to be sure it's accurate, but it's faster than creating that table from scratch, and hand-coding the HTML. These are quaint use cases and not stealing jobs or disrupting the market, but they are tangible. For my needs, Apple is winning, and that's enough. Perhaps it's not that different from my use of iPad Pro as my main computer. There are more powerful devices that can do more, but I don't need them. That doesn't mean iPad Pro is behind those other products, it's just a different platform and strategy. So far behind, they're aheadIt is quite funny to me to see everyone praising Amazon on Alexa+ when all they've seen is canned demos and a few tech reporters playing with it. I'll reserve judgement for when it's out in the wild on exactly how it compares to the competition. For whatever reason, Amazon has been completely excluded from the AI conversation, if only because everyone believed that the company gave up on Alexa. It's quite the turnaround to go from layoffs and losing money on a product to endorsing it as the future of Amazon. Amazon promises privacy and security with Alexa+. I've also got a bridge to sell you. Image source: AmazonAfter a keynote with no new products, everyone is talking about how far behind Apple is again. It's quite impressive, actually. Alexa+ won't start rolling out for another month and several of its features involve reminders and integrations with Ubering, similar to classic Siri. Be excited for the upgrades, sure, but I frankly don't understand the sentiment that Apple is further behind because of a demo. It reminds me a lot of how tech pundits would talk about a Samsung Galaxy release in February being miles ahead of iPhone. The device they're praising is a generation ahead of the fall iPhone, so of course it's got better specs, it is meant to compete with the iPhone coming out in seven months. While it's interesting to see how everything functions while it's all still in flux, I'm more concerned with how it compares once it reaches a steady state. There will be a maturity point eventually, and my expectation is that privacy, security, and access to on-device personal information will have Apple in the lead. One thing others have pointed out and I agree with: the biggest problem Apple has is the same one that bites it again and again. The company's secrecy and need to work behind closed doors just isn't helping in the AI race. Taking the race metaphor across the finish line ChatGPT made the image of this metaphor using the text in the article shared via SiriOpenAI, Perplexity, and Google Gemini are at the starting line with the other lanes empty. The gun goes off and they're running neck and neck. Suddenly, in the fourth lane, Apple bursts out from underground slightly behind the rest. It leaps out briefly taking a breath only to dive back into its tunnel like some kind of subterranean whale. The racers don't even look back at this odd spectacle as they pass Amazon, its starting line a mile into the race. Amazon starts running as the rest pass. Apple is nowhere to be seen as it's back underground preparing to surface again somewhere later. The crowd sees the contenders and the progress they are making. Meanwhile, everyone is wondering where Apple is in this race. They're nowhere to be seen, and even Amazon is running now. Apple must be behind. The real losersI know it is unfair for me to say Apple Intelligence is the only AI making a difference for me because it is the only one built into my devices. That's a whole different discussion the European Union will eventually try to weigh in on. On-device, private AI is where Apple will winIt'll be interesting to observe this metaphorical race going forward. There is an AI ceiling, at least on the consumer side in the near future, so I expect Apple will inevitably "catch up." Now if I haven't beaten this metaphor to death just yet, allow me one last smack. The real loser in this race isn't any of the competitors, but the observers. The discourse has gotten so extreme, so silly, and out of the space of reality, that the consumers using artificial intelligence are the real losers here. We've all been robbed of something precious and had it packaged then sold back to us with a pretty bow and a guise of progress. We were promised a revolution that would be either cataclysmic or life-changing. They said stealing all of the information on the web was necessary to change the world. They even said that it was too hard and too expensive to pay for and properly credit this content, so for the most part, they just didn't bother. Worse yet, the courts bought that argument. We never got that revolution, but they did steal everything. We got better autocorrect and AI slop. They got record profits. Every writer has a footprint, and a style. There are turns of phrase that they like using. For instance, our Managing Editor, Mike Wuerthele, can look at our texts blind and tell which one of us has written a piece without seeing a byline. It's disconcerting to see these turns of phrase stolen verbatim from a piece, mashed up with content from other venues, and then put forth as Google gospel at the top of nearly every search result. Apple delays spell DOOMIf you're a tech pundit looking for a clickbait headline, the only thing that'll get more clicks than Apple being behind is apparently Apple delaying an expected feature. The company bit off a bit more than it could chew with its personalized Siri based on app intents that it showed off during WWDC 2024. It's not coming in iOS 18.4 and likely not at all in iOS 18. No really, Apple please, take all the time you need. We need better.The whole concept was built on the existing app intents system that would allow Siri to understand what was on screen or buried within apps. It would allow the system to parse data found in separate places on the operating system, like Contacts showing who your mom is, Mail having an itinerary for a flight, Calendar having an event, and iMessage having a mention of an arranged ride. All this could combine to result in an answer to a query to "when is Mom arriving?" There are a few obvious problems with implementing the technology behind the feature. The system is incredibly complex and, like we've seen with summaries, it is prone to hallucination. And unlike summaries, which are harmless if wrong, this new Siri can't be wrong when dealing with crucial data and actions. If users have to go check the work of the AI, then there isn't a point. Apple Intelligence summaries are useful but don't always get it rightAll of this was being built on the old Siri model. Siri is still and would still be a machine learning model that accesses Apple Intelligence tools the same way it accesses app functions. And all that will be changing soon enough. Perhaps Apple realized the key component to this app intent system for Siri is having Siri be an LLM as well. Whatever the reason, it isn't coming before June. The level of integration provided by app intents being tied to Siri and Apple Intelligence could have leapfrogged Apple ahead. It would be something visible, understandable, useful, and above all, private. That said, the delay is good news for users. It's a sign Apple has learned its lesson with pushing out Apple Intelligence features that aren't ready for prime time. The need to have AI in 2024 pushed some boundaries Apple was uncomfortable with, and things started breaking. The BBC wasn't happy with notification summaries, and that was a black eye on Apple's efforts. Apple can't afford to ship a critical feature that gets details wrongNow imagine that same issue but with getting details of your mother's flight wrong. She probably doesn't want to wait in the airport for a few extra hours, and you certainly don't want to be circling or sitting in a parking lot for half of the day. Of course, this, combined with Amazon's announcements and ChatGPT's 40th new model version this week, has Apple being labeled as "behind" again. In the grand scheme, in the public eye, I'm not going to say that's necessarily wrong, but I wouldn't bet against Apple either. Apple was behind in the smartphone market, the tablet market, the smartwatch market, the headphone market, and the $3,500 headset market at one point. If we're calling Apple behind here even though it is providing tangible benefits for users, so be it, but don't bet against them being a bigger player soon. Apple Intelligence has had a rough start. Public perception places Apple far behind the competition. Delays are inevitable as Apple's need for perfection and security wins out over investor pressures. Meanwhile, I'll continue to benefit from Apple Intelligence and almost none of these other models as everyone yells about how behind they are. I'm excited for what's next. Humans are a tribal species that thrives on competition and debate, and it's no different when it comes to technology. Whether you're talking about Android versus iPhone or PlayStation versus Xbox, people love to pick sides. It's no different for the various artificial intelligence systems available. However, almost universally, it seems people and pundits are calling Apple Intelligence the biggest loser — even when compared to systems that haven't released yet. I remember when this whole "Artificial Intelligence" thing started. It was and still is a bad name for an evolution of technology that has nothing to do with computers knowing anything. Intelligence is literally defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge or skills. Artificial Intelligence does neither. The so-called "artificial intelligence" is just a brute-force technology that works best when it has access to mass amounts of data stolen by mostly large corporations from the web. It can't think, it can't reason, and it doesn't have knowledge — it has access to knowledge. It then parses that knowledge into a soup that sometimes makes sense, and sometimes doesn't. But it does it so confidently, that Google likes to put it forth as gospel, eager for people to scoop up, right or wrong, credited or not. I'll say it up front in case anyone is confused. I'm not here to defend Apple's current state in Apple Intelligence. Let's be frank — Apple's position isn't ideal, and I'm not going to try and convince anyone it's getting an unfair bad rap. It deserves the criticism it gets. There is a narrative going around that Apple wasn't even thinking of this technology until pressure mounted in late 2023. While it is possible Apple wasn't targeting a 2024 release, I doubt they completely missed that ChatGPT and Google Bard were part of a zeitgeist. Apple has been working on computational photography for many iPhone generations, from the bokeh effect introduced with iPhone 7's dual cameras to the intensive camera systems on iPhone 16 Pro Max. These advancements in iPhone photography necessitated a new chipset that would take the load off of the GPU — the Neural Engine. The Neural Engine debuted in the iPhone 8 with the A11 Bionic. While no one was calling these advanced models "AI" at the time, it was the foundation of the technology we use today. OpenAI began research for generative AI models in 2016, which is when Apple, Google, and Qualcomm also announced similar research projects. Apple revealed it was researching AI in December 2016, revealed the Neural Engine in 2017, then ChatGPT was released in 2022, and Apple Intelligence in 2024. That doesn't mean Apple didn't already have so-called AI before Apple Intelligence. A lot of early AI wasn't even generative. Google and others were waltzing on stage talking about AI when the technology they showed wasn't fundamentally different from the advanced ML used on iPhone at the time. Apple wasn't behind on AI in 2016, 2022, or 2024, it's been in the game since it started work on Project Titan in approximately 2015. For those that have already forgotten, Apple had always planned on it being an autonomous driving unit with AI. Increasing pressure to announce something, anything related to AI in 2023, seemingly forced Apple's hand. It can be seen in how the company talked about AI before WWDC 2024. The executives even went out of their way to avoid saying AI to the point it was a running joke in the tech community. Then suddenly, everyone at Apple was saying "AI." An internal adjustment occurred as they came up with their strategy on the fly. Market pressures from the stockholders, customers, and global influences forced Apple to come to the uncomfortable conclusion that the iOS cycle they had planned wasn't going to work. Apple Intelligence had to be revealed in June or the company would face incredible pushback. Without AI, Apple was "behind" and people would turn to competitors that offered access to this new popular technology. Let's not forget that at the time the existing models were doing little more than producing wild hallucinations and poorly conceived student essays. Even so, Google and OpenAI were promising a technology so grand and dangerous it could destroy humanity, eliminate all work, and collapse economies. While this Skynet level of AI never showed up, people ate up the idea, and Apple wasn't part of the conversation. Tech folk kept repeating the lie that AI was changing the world and Apple wasn't going to be part of the revolution. ChatGPT and Google Gemini are hammers, not self-aware computers. They help with very specific situations and make some really cool stuff. I can't help but be in awe at some of the generated images and videos. Interacting with a chatbot can be entertaining and unique, like talking to a video game. Zork writ large. There are people out there producing some really interesting stuff thanks to AI. When the technology is applied to science, research, analysis, and other academic or enterprise uses, it can do amazing things. But let's not fool ourselves. It is already having a detrimental effect on the internet. The real threat of AI from companies like Google and ChatGPT is the death of the information industry as a whole. Google started life with a goal to organize the world's information, now it is using that access to eliminate the need for the web outside of Google search results. It's thanks to companies like Google that we have a web built around ads and tracking users. That ad system pays the bills for publications so information can be researched, written about, published, then indexed by Google. Google has broken that cycle of trust many times over the years. It first did it by boiling the frog, gradually taking more of this revenue for itself, squeezing out everybody else. This has already forced the closure of many, many enthusiast sites, and several AppleInsider employees are refugees from that. It is doing it now by amalgamating several results from multiple sites into one AI summary. It now leads most searches with that, accuracy, accreditation, and payment be damned. Inevitably, the AI will increasingly feed on AI-generated content. This closed feedback loop reinforces specific ideas, eliminates human publication, and ultimately creates a web where the only place you can get any information is from trillion-dollar companies. The only way out of this mess is to stop treating AI like some kind of all-knowing tool that replaces human work. It can accelerate and enhance work done by humans, but it will never replace it. Apple could face a similar dilemma with Apple Intelligence as app intents and LLM Siri are finally rolled out. If users can get all of the information they need via voice interactions with Siri, there won't be much point for opening the app itself. Developers with sprawling UI elements and beautiful design could lose ground to utilitarian single-screen apps that interact solely through generative AI. Apple's on-device systems will be front and center, benefiting from developer's hard work, but without good ways to monetize apps beyond active service subscriptions. All of these companies have a responsibility to think about how the changes brought about by AI will affect incomes the world over. Hopefully they'll all realize that AI can be dialed back in some respects to ensure humanity can still shine through, whether it's via human-written articles or app UI. When Apple finally revealed Apple Intelligence, I was excited by everything they shared. It was on-device, private, secure, and not actively training on user data. Apple's AI tools were smart, if boring. Rather than promise lies like a thinking computer, Apple gave us generative autocorrect, writing tools, and system-wide summaries. Image Playground was and is a terrible attempt at competing on that front. It was somewhat excusable during the beta cycle, but nothing has changed since that bad superhero Mom example during WWDC, and that's not sustainable when competitors release new versions constantly. Though, I do think Image Playground needed to release to help see how users would take advantage of the model, kind of like Animoji or Memoji. It acted as a working example of Apple Intelligence in something more tangible than grammar checks. But yes, the images it makes are terrible if not horrific. Genmoji is neat and useful though. Apple even tied ChatGPT into Siri and its Apple Intelligence tools, but in a smart way that ensures user privacy. The implementation isn't dissimilar to how Siri calls out to Google privately to conduct a search. Of course, none of this mattered because the doom patrol was out in force to say how behind Apple was. Sure, it couldn't make a Pixar-grade image from a prompt, but the other tools were useful and most importantly, built into the devices they already owned. From the September release to today, many people have discussed just how far behind Apple is in this AI race. I think it comes down to a perception issue. Outwardly, Apple is behind. Why is anybody's guess. Apple isn't shipping new, obtusely named models every week with granular improvements and made-up new milestones. The executives aren't promising to end humanity's need for work. Apple is doing what it does best — working internally until something is ready, then releasing. In fact, Apple Intelligence might be one of the few examples of Apple releasing something before it was ready. My guess is that they had planned to announce all this at WWDC 2025, and we'd have gotten a more polished version of what we have today this fall. Instead, Apple has been trying to get something new to say about Apple Intelligence with every iOS 18 release. It's all been done in the name of playing catch-up with competitors that aren't even following the rules of their own race. They invent new terms and new goalposts to celebrate empty victories at every turn. It's all very disingenuous, and AI fatigue has already set in. I ask everyone all the time, here, in the AppleInsider Podcast, among friends and family, and even just people I'm conversing with in public - "what have you done with AI?" Really think about it.

Because I have to prioritize my time and despite wanting to read a thoughtful article on the subject all I have time for is this summary ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ “The article discusses the state of Apple Intelligence in the AI race, highlighting that while Apple’s position is not ideal, it is not as far behind as perceived. The author argues that the current AI landscape, dominated by large corporations, is flawed and potentially detrimental to the information industry. Despite Apple Intelligence’s useful features and privacy focus, it is criticized for being behind competitors, who often prioritize flashy releases over substance.”I think this illustrates my thoughts on the matter and the current state of things. And again, I don’t have time for much else. I think this illustrates my thoughts on the matter and the current state of things. And again, I don’t have time for much else. No one says you have to use AI to write a resume, draft an email, revise an awkward sentence, but tbh as a tech reporter you should dabble. Apple Intelligence- so far as I’ve been able to demo on my Mac - is barely discernible from regular Siri, and if you ask it to do anything spicy, it then asks you if you want to try with ChatGPT, which is certainly polite, but now two questions behind asking ChatGPT directly. IMO just like apple hasn’t released a search engine, they’ve only released ai in name, obviously to keep up with the hype. You said it yourself, llms are only useful with HUGE ( big is not big enough) datasets, and so being ethical will inherently limit a product. If apple wants to compete, they’ll have to square that and/or buy a leader.

But I fear 80% or more of the population will rely on them vs using them as a tool and questioning the results. Trust vs trust and verify. As long as I can use various AI tools on my M2 Mac Studio Ultra, not so much on my M3 MacBook Air, it's all I need. I really don't want the AI de Jour to mess with my experiences with macOS or iOS. I use Pinokio on the Studio and can run a plethora of interesting AI setups with one-click installation. I have the Pinokio installation home folder as a symbolic link on the internal and the actual data (a freaking ton of it with all the models) on an external fast solid state RAID 0 over TB. I don't want anything like that near my MBA. Everything is changing weekly if not daily. A new version of everything pops up faster than I can keep up, and thankfully, all are updateable with a click. That would not be the case if Apple integrated too much into the OS. I agree with the belief that Apple is best being a provider of platforms capable of fast AI use, as they do (very fast with the high-end offerings), but not trying to get involved with AI development directly. And yes, of course, I'd love a version of ChatGPT 4.o (or better) that listens and talks via my Home Pods and iPhones. I'd gladly pay extra for that!

Troubled audio company Sonos has reportedly told its staff that work on its promised streaming video player is now canceled. Apple has held firm on not granting backdoor access to users' iCloud data, and the UK continues to try to find a way — just not publicly. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple's expected new Home Hub device has been delayed until after WWDC in June 2025. Apple's lower-priced iPhone models might seem weak at first, but they're still outperforming nearly every other competitor in the smartphone market. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority wants Apple to allow rivals like Facebook to offer browsers on iPhone, but passes the buck on doing anything about it. Deals continue to pour in for Apple's M4 MacBook Air, 2025 iPad, M3 iPad Air, and Mac Studio, with savings of up to $987 off retail. With iOS 18.4 you can now use robotic vacuum cleaners inside of the Apple Home app and with Siri. It's still problematic but here's what you can do so far, and what the benefits are. A noted analyst has slashed his expectation for Apple stock by about 10% given what he sees to be slower iPhone upgrade rates because of tariffs, and a delayed Siri with Apple Intelligence rollout. Apple has held firm on not granting backdoor access to users' iCloud data, and the UK continues to try to find a way — just not publicly. The Apple Account Card feature is coming to six more countries very soon, although it isn't available for all users yet. Tuesday's iOS 18.3.2 update contains a supplementary security fix, fully patching an actively exploited vulnerability present in older versions of the iPhone operating system.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy - ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS' turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They've also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they've struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they "will be designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs." RELATED: Why your drug store is closing "By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we're continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage," a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has "done very little to defend revenue" of the front-end of its stores. "It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it's not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there's growing competition from chains like Walmart," he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself as a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. (The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)

Title: 7 Rewarding Career Paths for the Fearless Agile Program Manager

Time Published: 2025-03-10T12:30:00Z

STARCIO drive digital transformation STARCIO The redesigned StarCIO blog formally names Social, Agile, and Transformation. Learn more. Agile program managers are one of the roles hit hardest in the monthly stories of tech layoffs. I computed this by reviewing a sample of the 2022-2023 tech layoffs by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. From this sample, 8.3% of 500 layoffs impacted program managers. I suspect that the risk is much higher for program managers who champion waterfall, top-down, or command-and-control methodologies. Forrester reports 61% of organizations have deployed agile methodologies over the past five years and waterfall continues to decline. One of my most popular articles from 2021 was about how to be an agile program manager. Watch the embedded video on five key responsibilities of successful agile program managers and developing an agile program manager office. There may be a need for a program manager role in large enterprises with multi-team agile. Who manages vendors, contracts, and reporting for agile release trains (ARTs), tribes, or scrum of scrums, etc.? For other organizations, agile program manager roles are declining, especially during times of layoffs and downsizing. Agile program manager may feel a little vulnerable and scared about where to take their career paths. If you are laid off, you must consider repositioning yourself above and beyond your agile knowledge and program management skills. One of the key lessons in Chapter 1 of Digital Trailblazer is key to agile program managers. “Step out of your comfort zone and broaden your perspective by seeking outside‐in learning opportunities.” This is what I mean by the fearless, agile program managers. They step out of their comfort zones and develop competencies beyond the leadership skills and agile collaboration competencies. Consider your skills and experiences leading large-scale agile initiatives as building blocks. Here are seven career paths for agile program managers. This career path is for the more technical program managers. They develop DevOps, SDLC, cloud architecture, and other technical skill sets. It requires a hard pivot into more technical responsibilities, like becoming an agile technical team lead or solutions architect. The combination of agile program manager and architecture experience can lead to agile delivery leader roles and, potentially, CTO opportunities. Agile program managers who work in a single industry and develop expertise around its business models, customer segments, and operations should consider pivoting into business leadership responsibilities. The key to getting these roles is developing relationships with business executives in the industry who recognize program management as a key skill set and will open the doors when new opportunities emerge. Invest time at industry-specific conferences and networking events. This is a common career path for companies embracing agile methodologies and recognizing they need more product managers and agile product owners but fewer program and project managers. However, this transition only works well when CIOs commit to product management and the agile program manager embraces the key differences between program and product management responsibilities. If you seek this career path, consider reading selections from my 12 books for product managers and developing design thinking skills. Agile program managers who successfully lead product initiatives, grow end-user adoption, and drive revenue growth can pursue chief digital officer opportunities. Agile program managers with a knack, interest, and passion for compliance functions have two potential career paths. For those with data skill sets and an interest in machine learning and AI, developing a strong understanding of proactive data governance and GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, and other regulations can pivot into data governance leadership roles. Expand the skillset to AI governance and add a certification in ISO 27001 or similar, and there’s the opportunity to become an organization’s chief data officer. Pivoting from program management to information security roles may be a less likely career path, but it is still plausible for those willing to invest in the technical acumen and gain CISSP or similar certifications. One opportunity for agile program managers is to take on roles reporting to the CISO, including that of SOC Director, GRC Director, or security awareness leader. This career path may feel like taking a step backward in responsibilities, but it’s an option for agile program managers looking for stability and career opportunities in larger enterprises. ITSM leaders typically come up the ranks from individual contributor roles, but larger enterprises benefit by having ITSM directors who have strong customer support skills, agile backgrounds, and business relationship-building experiences. This career path is also good for agile program managers who are metrics-driven and enjoy driving continuous operational improvements. I know several program managers who achieved Six Sigma Black Belt certifications and developed expertise in change management who went on to become department directors. The key is to focus on a specific department’s operations and challenges and the opportunities beyond operational functions, especially in sales and marketing. The biggest mistake I see program managers make is getting too comfortable in their roles and expecting new opportunities based solely on the size and success of the initiatives they lead. Some program managers may go on to lead agile PMOs or become the CIO’s chief of staff. For many others, program management is a step in the journey, not a career. Find your path. I’m here to help.

Title: Forbes Daily: Markets Rattled, But Trump Remains Resolute On Tariffs

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. For all of the advancements in modern fitness technology, one of the latest viral crazes is remarkably simple: a headband with a ball attached by a stretchy string. Boxbollen has received endorsements from celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Conor McGregor, Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg, a strategy that hasn’t been cheap—Boxbollen has reinvested as much as 50% of its revenue into its marketing. But it’s paid off: In 2024, the company posted $59.2 million in revenue, its best year yet. “The question is sustainability,” a retail analyst told Forbes. “[A] $50 million business can grow into something larger, or it could fade away. … It’s hard to know what a $50 million business looks like a decade out.” President Donald Trump gestures as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2025. President Donald Trump downplayed last week’s stock market drop in an interview Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” Last week featured a dizzying amount of tariff news, and Trump on Friday said he might impose reciprocal tariffs on some Canadian goods, despite previously delaying the 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods for a month. MORE: The uncertainty of tariffs weighed on markets, as the S&P 500 recorded its worst weekly loss since September, declining 3.1%. More than $3 trillion in market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its February 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data. Mark Carney will replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister, and was critical of President Donald Trump in his victory speech on Sunday night. Carney, an economist who previously served as the governor of both Canada and England’s central banks, won with nearly 86% of the Canadian Liberal Party’s leadership vote, and vowed to keep retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.” Cracks are starting to show in the labor market, as fewer jobs were added than expected last month, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in February, and government jobs fell by about 10,000, though the March report is more likely to be impacted by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts due to the timing of the February survey. William Lansing took over as CEO of credit scoring company FICO in 2012, when the business was still recovering from the financial crisis. In 13 years, he’s made a bundle for long-term shareholders and himself an almost-billionaire, largely by pushing through margin fattening price increases. The once secretive analytics company has become a consumer brand that anyone looking to finance a car or home obsesses over. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY APU GOMES/GETTY IMAGES; JAAP ARRIENS/NURPHOTO; WANG ZHAO/AFP; HANNES P ALBERT/PICTURE ALLIANCE Elon Musk claims Tesla is not an electric car maker, but rather an AI company that can become the most valuable in the world—thanks to the data it collects from its cars. In theory, it could help train vehicles to operate without human assistance, but that data isn’t necessarily as helpful as Musk claims: Training AI on videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle the most critical edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios. Federal investigators suspect that hackers of password manager LastPass caused one victim to lose XRP cryptocurrency that is now worth some $716 million, due to a massive spike in crypto values following the election of President Donald Trump. It’s already been a big year for massive crypto thefts, after hackers stole $1.5 billion from the ByBit exchange in February, in what was dubbed the biggest crypto heist in history. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and other insiders at Dominari Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed wealth management firm, acquired 1 million company shares through a private placement and bonuses—the day before it was announced that the Trump brothers would join its advisory board. The timing probably does not violate insider trading laws, experts told Forbes, but raises questions about whether directors acted in the company’s best interests by selling the shares cheaply to themselves. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday sent a letter to President Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and asked him to make his financial disclosures with the government public, days after Trump announced the creation of an American crypto strategic reserve. In her letter, Warren asked how Sacks intends to prevent “the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.” The latest casualty of DOGE’s work is Notify.gov, a federal system designed to send mass texts to the public, and it’s in imminent danger of shutting down, according to publicly-available proposed changes to its website. The tool is used by governments at all levels to send out important warnings and reminders to citizens, but sources tell Forbes most of the team that manages it have been “fired, transferred, or have resigned.” The CDC is planning to study potential connections between vaccines and autism, a link that has been pushed controversially by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures spreading the long-debunked theory for years, and health experts have widely condemned his stance. MORE: Health officials in Maryland reported a positive measles case in a resident who had traveled internationally last week, unrelated to outbreaks of the disease in Texas and New Mexico. Measles was announced as being eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, given the success of vaccines in eliminating the disease, though outbreaks of the virus have still popped up among the unvaccinated. President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering new “large-scale” sanctions and tariffs on Russia to compel an end the Russia-Ukraine war, but hours later, he said “it may be easier dealing with Russia” compared to Ukraine. The warnings contradict a Reuters report earlier last week that the White House was considering easing sanctions against Russia to improve relations as it works to negotiate a ceasefire and permanent end to the conflict. “One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.” TOPLINE Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares’ quest to sell what he considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand for nearly a decade. Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target, as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across grocery store soup aisles industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category. Despite its growth, Mares wants the company to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of independent board member Sam McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue. With that kind of momentum behind Mares, he is now emboldened to scale up his business and begin selling what he deems as healthier food on a mass scale. “I have a vision much more than an investor does around what the food system should look like,” he says. “With what I want to build in the world, it’s much easier to realize your vision if you have more control.” WHY IT MATTERS Kettle & Fire cooks its products for 14 to 20 hours and sources grassfed beef with a strict set of standards to ensure high levels of collagen, amino acids, and vitamins and minerals. Mares and his team also remove the kinds of additives and ingredients like seed oils targeted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again crowd. Kennedy has touted the benefits of bone broth on social media, and podcaster Joe Rogan, who has extolled the benefits of the carnivore diet for years, is also a big fan of bone broth. MORE Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Retailers shed among the most jobs of any private-sector industry last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that could be just the tip of the iceberg: 6,300: The number of jobs the retail industry lost in February, second only to food services and drinking establishments, which lost 27,500 positions 19,000: The number of jobs cost from the bankruptcy of crafts retailer Joann, and another 16,000 jobs were lost from Party City Up to 15,000: The number of stores that retailers are expected to close this year, more than double the amount that closed in 2024 With all the talk of tariffs, layoffs and more, economic uncertainty is bound to cause stress. Focus on the things you can control: For instance, come up with a Plan B, like a side hustle to earn extra income. Exercise self-care and immerse yourself in the things that bring you joy, and don’t leave your financial situation up to chance—keep track of the money coming in and out. And remember that the unknown can have positive outcomes, too. A pop star who rose to fame in 2008 released a new album last week, which soared to the top of the charts. Who is it? A. Rihanna B. Taylor Swift C. Lady Gaga D. Beyoncé Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

Title: Walgreens heading down a very risky path | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Walgreens has been attempting a financial turnaround for years, and now it says it’s found a new path to finish it. But if history is any guide, its path is more likely to lead to its eventual demise than long-term success. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns drugstores in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and Thailand, announced last week that it would be ending a century as a publicly traded company, and would be sold to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Less than a decade ago it was America’s largest drugstore chain, and its stock was successful enough to replace iconic conglomerate General Electric in the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 companies selected for their importance to the economy and the overall market. But its shares have lost 83% of their value since that day, with a 71% plunge coming in just the last four years. And it would have lost more than that, if it wasn’t for investors looking ahead to the sale to Sycamore, which lifted shares more than 7% in Friday trading. Sycamore and Walgreens have both insisted the purchase will allow for the company, which has already closed many of its stores, to complete the turnaround more quickly. “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,” said Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth. “Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.” Related article Walgreens is going private in an up to $24 billion deal But despite the promise, retail’s graveyard is full of the bones of many once-dominant retailers who closed up shop after being bought by private equity firms. The list includes Toys R Us, Sports Authority and RadioShack — all once leaders in their fields. Even some companies that survived being taken private that survived, such as Aeropostale, did so only after a trip through bankruptcy court. Not all retailers taken private have failed. Some, such as Sycamore-owned Staples, continue to do well. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that this is the right solution, said Mark Cohen, the former head of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “Intellectually it sounds like a good idea to relieve a company of the quarter-to-quarter need to satisfy shareholders and instead focus on long-term success,” said Cohen. “But from a historical point of view, most of these deals result in the company circling the drain.” The private equity business model often relies upon forcing the company to take on massive amounts of debt to give the greatest possible return to the private equity firm, with the long-term survival of the business often not a priority. The debt is often used to pay “special dividends” to the firm itself to cover the initial purchase price, as well as heavy “management fees” placed on the company, to be paid to the private equity firm. Many times brick-and-mortar retail chains have been forced to sell off the buildings that house their stores and pay rents that they can’t afford to new owners, leading to even more store closings and layoffs. Neither Sycamore nor Walgreens had a comment when asked about the history of retailers closing after being taken private. As of last August, Walgreens had about 8,500 stores in the United States, and 3,700 foreign locations. That’s down by about 1,000 American stores and 1,000 foreign stores from where it stood when it joined the Dow in 2018. There are more store closings to come, as the company announced plans in October to shutter another 1,200 stores. Related article Walgreens admits locking up shampoo and toothpaste hurts sales. But it’s still doing it Walgreens itself was booted from the Dow a year ago and replaced by Amazon, which is providing its own growing competition with an online pharmacy. Walgreens has been passed by CVS as the nation’s largest drugstore chain. Both Walgreens and CVS and rival Rite-Aid have been struggling due to lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, hurting the pharmacy business in the back of the store, and growing competition not just from Amazon but from big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target, which often sell the same items as those in the front of stores. Whether or not Sycamore can fix the problems with Walgreens, it is likely to do well in the deal, considering it is getting the chain at a fraction of its former value and because of the way the deals are structured to benefit the private equity buyers, said Cohen. “The pathway to heaven is to fix the business and then take it public and make an enormous amount of money because you’re the shareholder,” Cohen said. But that’s not often the way things play out. “The typical pathway is to milk the business for as long as you can, then break it up and dispose of it,” Cohen added. The fundamental problems leading to the private equity purchase don’t go away with this deal, according to Cohen. “What is it about this transaction that is going to result in the recovery of this? In my opinion, nothing. Are they fundamentally going to be better able to compete with CVS or Amazon? No. Will they be able rationalize the behavior they’ve had to engage in of locking up toothpaste, rather than find some other way to protect their inventory, causing customers to run, not walk to Amazon? No,” he said. “The net of this is it’s just deck chairs on the Titanic being moved around.” CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: 3 major risks could send the stock market tumbling even further
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-major-risks-sp500-tariffs-ai-inflation-recession-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-08T10:50:01Z

Stocks have endured a bumpy period over the last few weeks amid a chaotic start to President Donald Trump's second term. Since February 19, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Most Wall Street estimates remain positive, but investors worry that three key risks could send stocks tumbling even further. Fears that the US economy is heading toward a recession have resurfaced in recent weeks. After a false alarm in 2022 and 2024, signals of potential labor market softening have again fueled worries of a downturn. "Both WARN and Challenger data point to a further rise in private sector layoffs to come in March, and growing anxiety in the consumer confidence surveys about the future health of the labor market usually is a reliable sign of rising joblessness to come too," said Samuel Tombs, Chief US Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on Friday. Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro, also said in a client note on Friday that the weakness is likely to continue. One reason for this is that state and local government spending on salaries is dipping sharply, as is spending on construction wages, a leading indicator. Spending in these areas has fallen during prior downturns. "I don't see an end unless the Fed takes steps to lift demand," he said in a note on Friday. Investors were tuned into February's non-farm payroll report on Friday morning for clues about where the labor market is headed. They didn't get much insight as the US economy added 151,000 jobs, near expectations, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly inched up to 4.1%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the US economy remains solid, sending stocks climbing. But Trump's on-and-off implementation of tariffs has added another level of uncertainty to economic growth, Wall Street banks say. Firms like Apollo, BCA Research, and TD Cowen have all warned of the rising likelihood of recession thanks to tariffs. Goldman Sachs on Friday also raised its recession odds for the next 12 months from 15% to 20% due to tariffs, but acknowledged the import fees could be reversed. "We have raised it by only a limited amount at this point because we see policy changes as the key risk, and the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious," Jan Hatzius, the bank's chief US economist, said in a note. "If policy headed in the direction of our risk scenario or if the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further." On the flip side of tariff-related recession worries are concerns that the import taxes will drive up consumer goods prices. So, even if the economy is resilient, rising prices could lead the Fed to hike rates again, creating downward pressure on stocks and on consumers. Or an even worse situation could arise: prices could surge due to tariffs while the economy continues to weaken. "Tariffs are a self-inflicted stagflationary policy for the U.S. economy that was otherwise poised to continue growing at a solid pace," said Phill Colmar, managing partner and global strategist at MRB Partners, in a note Friday. "The U.S. exceptionalism theme will continue to unwind, and U.S. equities are not yet priced for downside growth risks." Inflation has seen a slight resurgence in recent months, rising from 2.4% in September to 3% in January. The Fed is expected to implement two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. Outside of the shaky macroeconomic picture, the mega-cap AI stocks that drive broader stock-market indexes could continue to suffer. That's because their strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure has come into question after the release of a cheaper and more energy-efficient chatbot from Chinese firm Deepseek. Investors have suddenly been made to wonder if the valuations these stocks have commanded on the promise of impressive future growth are justified. The paradigm shift has been painful for US AI stocks. Year-to-date, shares of Nvidia are down 18.5%, Microsoft is down 6%, Amazon is down 9.5%, and Alphabet has dropped 7.8%. Meanwhile, Chinese AI stocks have rallied: shares of Alibaba, who also released a relatively inexpensive chatbot, are up 65% year-to-date, while JD.com and Tencent have risen 23% and 28%, respectively. "AI is here to stay, and if anything, DeepSeek reinforces that. However, the latest developments do also show that investment approaches that are too concentrated or overly passive can be risky, as value can quickly shift within the AI ecosystem," said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a January 28 note. "An active and diversified approach is a better way to gain exposure to AI, in our view." Jump to

Title: The tariff fight is far from over

Happy Friday! If you're grabbing an Uber or Lyft this weekend and a Tesla shows up, do yourself a favor and don't bring up Elon Musk. Whether you love him or hate him, chances are your driver doesn't want to talk about it. (And if you insist on doing it, they'll probably just say what they think will get them the best tip.) In today's big story, tariffs against Canada and Mexico have been mostly delayed by a month in yet another turnaround in the ongoing trade war. What's on deck Markets: One betting market has the odds of a US recession at 32%. Tech: Microsoft is talking up a massive quantum-computing breakthrough. Amazon execs aren't buying it. Business: Some senators want to take a closer look at X's advertising tactics. But first, another postponement. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. So, about those tariffs… Two days after implementing a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods, President Donald Trump is pulling a U-turn. The president announced a one-month pause on tariffs for both countries' imports that fall under an agreement called USMCA. If you're a bit rusty on your global trade regulations, USMCA was the trade deal that Trump negotiated between the US, Canada, and Mexico to replace NAFTA. The trade pact covers most goods, making Trump's announcement almost equivalent to the monthlong pause on tariffs he initiated in February. The offer didn't extend to the other target of Trump's tariffs, China, which has issued retaliatory tariffs. There's long been speculation that Trump's tariffs were merely a negotiation tactic to get better trade terms from other countries. And the president's willingness to issue another reprieve from his trade taxes could be proof of that. But the market's willingness to accept the ongoing uncertainty might only extend so far. Investors are already on edge as fears of a potential recession start to bubble up. Stocks rebounded on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted a resolution to the tariff situation could be coming. But despite the official announcement on Thursday, stocks finished down considerably. The S&P 500 closed 1.78% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.61%. Trump's flip-flopping may not pay off in the long term. That's according to supply chain and conflict resolution scholars, who said his tariff tensions are eroding the US's relationships with its allies. Things aren't likely to calm down in the meantime. The February jobs report comes out this morning. It will help inform the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on March 19, which is less than two weeks away. And the fight over tariffs is far from over. Canada and Mexico's postponement is only until April 2. That also coincides with the kickoff of more tariffs. This time they're targeting foreign agricultural goods and other products. Trump also mentioned South Korea, India, and the European Union over what he said were unfair trade relations. There's no shortage of experts weighing in on what it all means. If you want to sound smart about the Trump tariffs, here are some of the best thinkers to follow. Sorry, American firms, the AI trade has moved to China. 1. Economists and betting markets agree: Odds of a recession are rising. The chance of a US recession jumped to 32% on Thursday on Polymarket, up 23% from late February. Wall Street economists say the reason is Trump-shaped — the administration's unpredictable policy moves could shake consumer confidence to the core. 2. Inside "Project Voyage," Goldman Sachs' grand plan to thin its ranks, cut costs. In addition to moving the bank's annual culling of underperformers up the calendar, CEO David Solomon plans to relocate employees from New York City to lower-cost areas like Dallas and Salt Lake City, people familiar with the program told BI. One former employee said Project Voyage is a multi-year plan, and you can expect these divisions to be the most impacted. 3. How much do investment bankers really make? As Wall Street waits to see if a dealmaking rebound will fully materialize this year, recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners heard from over 900 investment bankers on how much they earned in 2024. Check out some of the survey's highlights. 1. The petition to standardize closed captions. BI's Katie Notopoulos has a bone to pick with streaming services: Captions are too hard to figure out. Every streamer has a different interface, posing a challenge for the 63% of Americans under 30 who prefer subtitles. Maybe you're swiping up, but what if it's actually down? Perhaps you accidentally click the dreaded "Play from the Beginning" button in the process. She thinks it's all too much, and it's also an accessibility issue. 2. Amazon calls BS on Microsoft's quantum-computing claims. In an email to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon's head of quantum tech expressed doubts that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum computing chip could do all it was hyped up to do, according to a copy of the email obtained by BI. Industry experts said tech companies might be generating more hype than substance in their attempts to outdo each other in the field. 3. The shortcut for cheap AI. Distillation — using one model to improve another — has more potential today than ever, thanks to the plethora of open-source models that can serve as "teachers." While some developers celebrate the concept, the big AI companies behind foundation models need to justify and protect their pricey offerings. 1. These senators want an investigation into Elon Musk's X. Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Adam Schiff, and Chris Van Hollen are calling for a DOJ probe into X. Specifically, they want to know if X is leveraging Musk's political status to pressure companies into advertising on the social media platform, referencing an article from The Wall Street Journal article last month. Read the letters they sent to the DOJ and the FTC. 2. Playing dress up with an AI twist. Fashion app Doji uses AI to help users virtually try on clothes, and early beta testers are loving it. One fan is none other than Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who's also backing it through his venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. 3. Social Security employees can't read news sites at work anymore. As the Trump administration continues restructuring the Social Security Administration, a recent agency-wide email announced new browsing restrictions for employees' work computers. Restrictions prohibit workers from checking the news, online shopping, and visiting sports sites. According to the email, the goal is to limit risk and protect sensitive information. I tried ChatGPT's new Deep Research. It was worth the extra wait of up to 30 minutes for its reports. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Ties between The Trade Desk and key media agencies are weakening

Time Published: 2025-03-07T05:01:00Z

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail The Trade Desk (TTD) and media agencies are drifting apart — a conscious uncoupling that crept in slowly but is now moving fast. Agencies say their spending isn’t climbing like it used to, while The Trade Desk is busy chasing direct deals with advertisers. It’s not a full on breakup yet, but both sides are clearly eyeing other options. One holding company media buyer, who exchanged anonymity for candor, told Digiday that rising client investment in CTV — and the many DSPs that can be used to place such spend — meant their agency was becoming less reliant on The Trade Desk over time. “We’ve had — we have — a great relationship with TTD. I just think that the dominance of the inventory that they represent is less and less important,” said the buyer. That sentiment has only grown louder over the past two years as media agencies have taken more control over programmatic ad buying. Once content to let ad tech players like The Trade Desk handle it, agencies have been pushed by advertisers to step up, building out their own tech and services to optimize ad buying. Naturally, that shift pulled them away from The Trade Desk and closer to the other power players in the auction: supply-side platforms, which hold the data and tech agencies need to secure the best ad impressions. In addition, there’s concerns among some media buyers over rising data fees and dwindling transparency around the ways its products work. “Those things add up to the point where it may be less expensive to run [a campaign] through a walled garden or another platform,” said Jonathan D’Souza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler. In turn these frustrations are starting to influence where advertisers choose to spend their dollars. Indeed, media agency execs say their dependence on it is slipping as client investments bend toward channels that The Trade Desk doesn’t dominate in, namely CTV where, despite its expertise, there’s competition. Viant, for example, saw overall revenues increased 30% in 2024. According to co-founder and COO Chris Vanderhook, that was due to a “massive tailwind” from CTV demand. It’s a thought not lost on the execs at Amazon Ads, who are using the promise of CTV advertising powered by its rich data as a hook to convince more advertisers to use its own DSP. So far, it appears to be working. The company raked in $17.3 billion in ad revenue last quarter, a 17% rise driven by its DSP’s growth. As Digiday previously reported, it’s beginning to encroach upon established ad tech players and, in time, is expected to provide serious competition for The Trade Desk. “Amazon’s DSP has come a long way, and a lot of that has to do with… their market dominance, their data, their commerce solution, their proprietary inventory,” said one anonymous buyer. “They are coming for The Trade Desk.” These tensions are mounting as The Trade Desk’s grip on ad dollars faces pressure from three sides: a fragmented CTV market, the slow death of third-party cookies that fuel its audience targeting and the looming risk that their disappearance could dent its buying efficiency in key areas. After the firm’s recent earnings brought The Trade Desk its first revenue miss in 33 straight quarters, chief exec Jeff Green told analysts that the company had overhauled its client-facing teams as part of a 15-point plan to regain momentum. That included layoffs (it’s unclear how many precisely) and a reorientation of some teams around clients and business verticals; the company’s jobs board currently includes several openings for director and manager positions focused on managing brand relationships. In addition, Green said TTD planned to pursue more joint business plans (JBPs) — direct arrangements struck with big advertisers. A Trade Desk spokesperson referred Digiday to remarks Green made during TTD’s most recent earnings call in a request for comment — during which, Green claimed that TTD’s brand direct relationships were growing 50% faster than other parts of the business. This not so subtle push to cozy up to agency clients directly might look like a threat, but it’s arguably the least important factor at play. The Trade Desk’s pursuit of more top advertiser partnerships isn’t expected to be an issue, given clients will still typically ask agencies to execute and advise on investments. “JBPs are not a threat to the way agencies work,” said one buyer, who asked to remain anonymous, citing continued existing relationships with The Trade Desk. Even recent structural shake-ups within the company’s agency team aren’t seen as something that will escalate tensions with agencies — at least no higher than they already are. In fact The Trade Desk’s day-to-day relationship with agencies appears to still be relatively healthy, especially those outside the holdco groups, according to five buyers that spoke with Digiday. For instance, at indie shop Wpromote, head of media investment Deanna Mulkeen described TTD’s DSP as “a critical part of our media mix … Nobody is perfect, but I think The Trade Desk has been really strong for us.” And for many advertisers, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. According to Ryan Eusanio, svp, video and programmatic at Omnicom Media Group, most clients will utilize multiple DSPs according to their media needs. An advertiser focusing on YouTube might adopt DV360 as a “primary” platform and use another as its “secondary”, he said. “A lot of our clients use [The Trade Desk] as a primary DSP. They’ve been an industry leader in the CTV space for a very long time, [and] we’ve built a lot of co-developed capabilities with them,” he explained. The real question, though, is how far that collaboration with agencies will go. The Trade Desk remains the preeminent gateway to the open web for many. But when growth is on the line, partnerships often take a back seat. The Trade Desk quells talk of full URL-level campaign reporting (similar to Amazon), but there are nuances. The Dentsu media agency’s three new leaders bring broader more traditional chops to widen out the agency’s ability to deliver up and down the funnel for its clients. Nothing is decided yet, but if Coca-Cola does opt for a change then Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth close to $1 billion.
