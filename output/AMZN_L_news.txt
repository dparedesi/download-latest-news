By Lambert Strether. Bird Song of the Day American Robin, Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge; Deadman Lake. Alaska, United States. Readers, I’m going to close out with the American Robin, because it’s always such a lift to the spirits to hear them burbling after a rainstorm. So, robins until Friday. –lambert * * * In Case You Might Miss… Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “One Word Describes Trump” [The Atlantic]. “Weber wondered how the leaders of states derive legitimacy, the claim to rule rightfully. He thought it boiled down to two choices. One is rational legal bureaucracy (or “bureaucratic proceduralism”), a system in which legitimacy is bestowed by institutions following certain rules and norms. That is the American system we all took for granted until January 20. Presidents, federal officials, and military inductees swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a person. The other source of legitimacy is more ancient, more common, and more intuitive—’the default form of rule in the premodern world’ [Stephen E. Hanson, a government professor at the College of William & Mary, and Jeffrey S. Kopstein, a political scientist at UC Irvine] write. ‘The state was little more than the extended ‘household’ of the ruler; it did not exist as a separate entity.’ Weber called this system ‘patrimonialism’ because rulers claimed to be the symbolic father of the people—the state’s personification and protector…. In his day, Weber thought that patrimonialism was on its way to history’s scrap heap. Its personalized style of rule was too inexpert and capricious to manage the complex economies and military machines that, after Bismarck, became the hallmarks of modern statehood. Unfortunately, he was wrong. Patrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations. In its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader’s personal property or family business.” • Hmm. Patrimonialism seems akin to the Schmittian friend/enemy distinction. DOGE Elon out over his skis: “Email starts power clash between Musk and agency leaders — even the Trump loyalists” [Politico]. “Elon Musk’s weekend threat to federal workers triggered panic and confusion Sunday as administration officials rushed to issue sometimes conflicting guidance, setting in motion a power struggle between Musk and agency heads appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the federal government. The guidance varied by agency…. It’s the latest episode of Musk’s ‘move fast and break things’ philosophy clashing with the layers of rules and laws that fortify the bureaucracy he hopes to hobble. And it’s the first sign that even staunch Trump loyalists are beginning to flex their political muscle against Musk, an unelected ‘special government employee,’ whose power stems primarily from his proximity to the president.” • Hmm. Here is the letter: I have seen three explanations for this letter, besides sheer harassment (most employees I know of work in a chain of command; they certainly don’t need to report to Elon). (1) The letters will be fed into an AI, and keywords found will be used for firing; (2) the letters are a sorting device for stupid or loyal people, a la the Nigerian 419 fraud; (3) based on the request for that the worker’s managed be cc’ed, results would enable a more accurate, granular org chart of the Federal government to be constructed. “OPM’s Own Guidance Says Fed Employees Never Have to Respond to the Elon Emails” [Talking Points Memo]. “Notwithstanding that what amounts to a prank email has had the entire federal government debating with itself over the last 48 hours, Musk’s own Office of Personnel Management says that federal employees never have to respond to any of these emails. After landing at the Office of Personnel Management in January, DOGE operatives first order of business was to set up a new email system through which all federal employees could be emailed through a single distribution list. They built it on a new server system outside of the established government email system. But emails it sends come to civil servants from the email address HR at OPM dot gov. This new system was given the name Government-Wide Email System (GWES). On February 5th, 2025 — in other words, well after the Trump and more specifically Musk was in charge of OPM — OPM published this document, Privacy Impact Assessement for GWES. As you can see here, most specifically in sections 4.2 and 4.3, federal government employees are never obligated to respond to any GWES emails and are under no obligation to share any information. Indeed, section 4.3 says that to mitigate the risk that the federal employees may not realize this, every GWES email should ‘explicitly stat[e] that the response is voluntary.'” • BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!! Here are a few of the better “five bullets” letters, culled from the Intertubes: Here's one creative way @SecretService managers told agents to respond to Elon Musk's surprise email demanding hat fed employees list their 5 accomplishments last week. Sources said it was designed to avoid agents sharing sensitive and classified details of their work protecting… pic.twitter.com/3dSx9n0ayi — Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) February 23, 2025 And: I’m going to need five bullets on what you did this past week by morning. pic.twitter.com/SFR3bkU3Hg — Katie Mehnert (@katiemehnert) February 24, 2025 And (NSFW): pic.twitter.com/1YNJMXkizS — Josh Ellis (@jzellis) February 24, 2025 * * * “How Trump’s government-cutting moves risk exposing the CIA’s secrets” [CNN]. “The CIA is conducting a formal review to assess any potential damage from an unclassified email sent to the White House in early February that identified for possible layoffs some officers by first name and last initial and could’ve exposed the roles of people working undercover, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. That’s just one of multiple aftershocks from President Donald Trump’s push to take a jackhammer to the federal government – including the CIA. The administration’s efforts to cut the workforce and audit spending at the CIA and elsewhere threaten to jeopardize some of the government’s most sensitive work, current and former US officials familiar with internal deliberations say. And on the CIA’s 7th floor — home to top leadership — some officers are also quietly discussing how mass firings and the buyouts already offered to staff risk creating a group of disgruntled former employees who might be motivated to take what they know to a foreign intelligence service. Taken together, those actions highlight the depth of unease among career officials that Trump’s efforts to speedily slim down the US government may be putting American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers.” • So far, Trump — except for slapping those “50 intelligence officials” around for election interference — has left the spooks alone (presumably the generation of spook-related cover stories formerly undertaken by USAID will be moved to State). So is this story a message? A warning shot? What? “Despite the hype, DOGE hasn’t found a shred of fraud” [Public Notice]. “DOGE has claimed it’s rooted out $55 billion worth of spending, a dollar amount that appears to be wildly inaccurate: As of Sunday, DOGE’s website claims it has saved or cancelled $55 billion worth of government contracts. But that same website only accounts for $16 billion in contracts. Half of that comes from an $8 million government contract that DOGE incorrectly identified as being worth $8 billion. Additionally, DOGE has been in some cases simply cancelling contracts that the government has already paid for. Some $325 million in supposed savings are simply contracts that have been repeated in DOGE’s reporting, Politico found. But actual fraud? DOGE has found nothing. None of this has stopped Trump, Musk, congressional Republicans, and their allies in rightwing media from breathlessly highlighting millions of dollars’ worth of spending as examples of fraudulent government programs. Nowhere in those lists of programs — like the USAID initiatives that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been lambasting for weeks, including the tortured and incorrect claim that US taxpayers funded ‘condoms for Gaza’ — is anything that even Musk or Trump themselves have identified as ‘fraud.’ Instead, the goalposts for DOGE have silently moved from finding fraud and corruption to simply pointing out and cancelling government programs that Trump and Republicans simply don’t support.” • I kinda turned off following the detail on this story after Musk went all “Ghost of COBOL” on Social Security…. Democrats en déshabillé “AI video of Trump kissing Musk’s feet plays on TVs in HUD building” [The Register]. “A video produced using artificial intelligence (AI) showing President Trump rubbing and kissing Elon Musk’s feet played on television screens in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) building Monday in an apparent mocking of the relationship between the two men. The words ‘Long live the real king’ were displayed over the top of the computer-generated video, a reference to Trump’s Truth Social post last week in which he wrote, ‘Long Live the King!’ The Hill obtained a photo of the screens in the HUD building as the video was playing.” • Here’s the video: On Monday morning, TV sets at the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development played the seemingly AI-generated video on loop, along with the words “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.” Read the full article: https://t.co/TYHyCUUqvV pic.twitter.com/dHRjnmVes6 — WIRED (@WIRED) February 24, 2025 I fail to understand the extraordinary hold this trope has on the liberal Democrat mind; it began, or at least was normalized, in a series in The New York Times back in 2018. Liberals seem to believe that the trope is an enormous “own” of conservatives. In fact, it shows that for liberalism — hold onto your hats, here, folks — tribalism trumps principle. In what other context would the “In this house….” rainbow-flag crowd treat gay lovers as anything other than worthy of praise, indeed emulation? But bring in a demon figure, and the deep triggers go off…. “Angry Democratic donors turn off the flow of money” [The Hill]. “Democratic donors — from bundlers to small dollar donors — say they are still angry about the election results and uninspired by anything their side has put forward since then. ‘I’ll be blunt here: The Democratic Party is f‑‑‑ing terrible. Plain and simple,’ one major Democratic donor said. ‘In fact, it doesn’t get much worse.’ A second donor was equally as pointed. ‘They want us to spend money, and for what? For no message, no organization, no forward thinking. … The thing that’s clear to a lot of us is that the party never really learned its lesson in 2016. They worked off the same playbook and the same ineffective strategies and to what end?'” • The party did great in 2016 and 2020. They crippled the left, and that’s their main goal as a party, right? Stop whining, donors! You never had it so good! “Carville suggests Trump admin will ‘collapse’ within 30 days” [The Hill]. “Democratic strategist James Carville suggested the Trump administration will ‘collapse’ within 30 days as the public reacts to the sweeping actions from the executive branch. ‘I believe that this administration, in less than 30 days, is in the midst of a massive collapse and particularly a collapse in public opinion,’ Carville said during a conversation with Mediaite’s Dan Abrams about the Trump administration’s unprecedented recent actions. Abrams asked Carville to clarify what he meant, to confirm that Carville believes the administration will crumble shortly. ‘It’s collapsing right now. We’re in the midst of a collapse,’ Carville replied. ‘This is the lowest approval, not even close, that any president has ever had at a comparable time.'” • This is cope. Not buying it. And if I did, it would be bad: The Democrats must suffer much, much more before there is any change, inside or outside the party. Republican Funhouse Maybe: Voters are mostly liking what they see in the first month of the new presidency. By 57/43 voters say Trump doing a better job than Biden in advance look at poll coming out Monday. Job approval at 52 but closing the border, cutting waste are hugely popular. So is resetting merit… — Mark Penn (@Mark_Penn) February 23, 2025 I’d certainly give the Trump administration more than Carville’s thirty days, though. Realignment and Legitimacy “Monopoly Round-Up: The Populist Revolt Against Oligarchy Begins” [Matt Stoller, BIG]. why choose to focus on Bernie Sanders giving speeches on how he doesn’t like the superrich? I mean, yawn. Right? But something about this campaign is different. It’s not so much what Bernie is saying, it’s that he is doing it to overflow crowds in Nebraska and Iowa. And it’s not just event crowds, his videos are getting tens of millions of views, and his online campaign metrics are performing remarkably well. I got a note from a contact in Bernie-world, who told me that ‘The level of engagement is higher than the last presidential.’ Democratic operatives who have traditionally disliked Bernie are noting what he’s doing, approvingly. Even billionaire Mark Cuban, who hates populism, is calling Bernie’s approach ‘really smart.’ …. This anti-big business vibe isn’t necessarily channeling itself through the Democrats, who are deeply loathed and distrusted…. What’s important about what Bernie is doing, and these other signals, is he might be showing that fear of oligarchy is the dominant view of a large swath of the public. If that’s the case, a lot of things could change, and quicker than we might imagine.” • (Readers; Please keep the Bernie grousing to a minimum. We know all those points by heart.) What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there!

Measles “Former FDA chief ‘very concerned’ about Texas measles outbreak spreading” [The Hill]. “Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he is ‘very concerned’ about the measles outbreak in Texas spreading…. He noted that he believes it ‘will spread.’ ‘There’s been 100 cases that have been identified so far,’ Gottlieb said. ‘There’s probably many more than that. ‘So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out,’ he added. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed at least 90 cases of measles and said 16 patients were hospitalized. Just five of the patients were vaccinated…. Gottleib also noted that there could be economic impacts from the spread of measles, as other countries could place the U.S. under a travel advisory. ‘The risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level,’ Gottlieb said.” Treatment: Covid “Demographic Variation In US Outpatient Hydroxychloroquine And Ivermectin Use During The COVID-19 Pandemic” [RAND]. “Using insurance claims from the MedInsight Emerging Experience Research Database for 8.1 million patients from all fifty US states, we evaluated COVID-19-associated outpatient hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin use and spending throughout the public health emergency (January 30, 2020-May 11, 2023) versus pre-public health emergency rates. …. The combined overall hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin utilization rate was threefold higher in older versus younger adults. Ivermectin use was greater among patients with the highest versus the lowest degree of social vulnerability and in the southern US versus other regions.” Origins Debate “What sparked the COVID pandemic?

In the incident in question, the aircraft failed to pressurize following a routine departure from DHL’s European hub located at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEI) in Germany.

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’). This is a rare win for the forces of disenhittification and it deserves recognition. It turns out that in these Mangionean times, companies can actually be bullied into comporting themselves with marginally less sleaze and cruelty. It’s especially noteworthy that this took place in the UK, where Prime Minister Kier Starmer has invited tech companies to pick Britons’ pockets without fear of consequence, by firing the top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK.” • Yay!

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’). This is a rare win for the forces of disenhittification and it deserves recognition. It turns out that in these Mangionean times, companies can actually be bullied into comporting themselves with marginally less sleaze and cruelty. It’s especially noteworthy that this took place in the UK, where Prime Minister Kier Starmer has invited tech companies to pick Britons’ pockets without fear of consequence, by firing the top competition regulator and replacing him with the former head of Amazon UK.” • Yay!

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. May you sail into your future on calm seas, with propitious winds and pleasant, sunny days. Thank you, especially for the “propitious winds” part (me being watchful of whatever is airborne).

The Atlantic article and Weber’s patrimonialism is utterly anti-historic. In Mesopotamia, the ruler’s household — the palace economy — was corporately distinct, as were the temples (usually close to the ruler). The economy at large was governed by common law on the land. So it was a bifurcated (or better, trifurcated) economy. The state emerged only in classical antiquity. Not in anthropological societies, where the chieftain’s household also was distinct. Awesome, thanks! It was the Schmittian aspect that appealed to me. Did the friend/enemy distinction appear as the key aspect of politics back in Mesopotamia? I have no notion of how that discourse would have appeared, or even if States in those days conceived of “politics” as we do, so perhaps that is a very stupid question. Schmitt’s theorizing on the friend/enemy distinction appears based on his philosophical decision about human nature not the historical development and evolution of the State. “Because the sphere of the political is in the final analysis determined by the real possibility of enmity, political conceptions and ideas cannot very well start with an anthropological optimism. This would dissolve the possibility of enmity, and thereby, every specific political consequence.” See Carl Schmitt, (The Concept of the Political), pg. 64 That HUD video seems especially stupid, aside from just being dumb – unless all those people were just fired and not worried about use of resources, connecting to 3rd parry tools, if HQ means an area where the public could walk in then public presentation without authorization, etc etc that would get me fired from my private sector job. Who the heck knows why the libs think that deploying gay fetishist images are the way to troll the quote unquote fascists into submission. It’s projection. And infuriating. Thanks for pointing this out. My brain shut off with “disgusting” and refused to delve deeper. ive never understood the foot fetish thing,lol. i mean, to each his own…and Tam’s pinky toes were tiny and bent and cute and all…but man! to reify feet thataway… i wonder at the psychology of it. I never got a boner from feet, myself. democratic culture seems to consist entirely of ad hominem “owns” of republicans. i find it to be deeply frustrating, and exacerbated by the internet. (it’s a lot easier to make fun of people who you don’t actually know, and there are no repercussions, only ingroup praise.) they think it’s funny to “turn the republicans own weapons against them,” when really it’s just one giant bullyish name calling match. a lot of the people i hung out with this weekend spoke of trump and republicans in a really mocking sense. mostly online young women in their 20s. one of them told me about a tiktok trend called “republican makeup” (link for reference) where people put on “foundation that is the wrong color and overlined lips”, while democrat makeup was “like actually good makeup.” which reminded me of the “our blessed nyc clean girl aesthetic vs their barbarous southern beauty queen aesthetic” meme. i am reaching the point where i am just going to ignore everyone who acts like that if i can. because me going “erm thats dumb actually” feels like it’s contributing to the cycle. What is a bit disturbing today is two or three of the screen grabs I have seen from the NSA and what the employees were discussing online in an open forum at the agency. Very inappropriate for work. It is also a bit disgusting to me – not everyone who has had the work they described is happy with the results – there are those in my practice who are in constant misery all day. I am no prude. In my life and my line of work, I have heard it all. But that does not mean this is appropriate to be placed on an open forum at work. Had I done anything like that all the way through my career up into the present day – I would have been terminated immediately. I know that because it has happened several times to others in my life – for far far less than what was done at HUD and what was released from NSA today. The HUD tape and now the NSA forum – the kid last year doing the OnlyFans on Amy Klobuchar’s desk in the Senate committee room…..I can go on and on…… What is wrong with these people? Why do they think this kind of behavior is OK? Here, read some history: Triggering the Libs. I never know if people who only quote one side of the food fight were particularly online in the last yen years, where a lot of this originated. Anyway, I always think about Thomas Frank’s masterpiece, Make Them Cry. Now that people believe that the state is mostly unable to deliver positive outcomes for people, they’ve decided to use virality and state power, if possible, to punish and upset their enemies. I think there may be one big difference – this Dem was so “triggered” by much of what was done in the past 4 years not by random online people but by actual employees and staffers of Dem congresspeople and agencies that it really turned me off to the whole Dem architecture in DC. As in really making me believe they need a break from power. Random online people are not the same as employees and staffers. No, no difference. Why? Those people who started it online on the right are now in power so I think the point stands. The Thiel network is staffed through with groypers and Very Online People, including our VP Vance and most of the DOGE main characters. Elon’s Hitler salute was a classic lib-owning 4-chan bit, even saying that “he is become meme.” Life is now a crummy mirror of the posting wars of the last decade where the group in power gets to punish the others. I don’t think we could honestly look at 2021 and say that Trump world handles COVID substantially better than Biden world, and the fact that we get to live through this farce is heartbreaking. Those online people (groypers and alt right) are now the ones in power, punishing their enemies and privatizing the government so the cycle of Making Them Cry continues. I read somewhere that that video was not an HUD video . . . . not authored and placed by HUD people . . . but was placed there by an outside hacker. Has anyone else read different? How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it? >How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it?

Re: HP and De-enshittification I love the term “enshittificatory” – ha! I suggest another term – “enshittifigenic” … as in, thanks to private equity and greased AI we live in an enshittifigenic environment. I have to admit in my line of work we spent a lot on HP Test and Measurement equipment. We worked closely with them my whole career (later on it was Agilent Technologies, and then Keysight.) Their people were top notch. The equipment was the gold standard for test, data acquisition, and control. They were a big part of what I consider the old Silicon Valley to be all about – technical competence, world class support, and a minimum of BS. This thing they call HP today – I don’t see any of that anymore. Sad. The American Robin was the first bird I identified as a child. It may be common but is still special. Lambert: Thank you for all your contributions over the years. From articles to links to Water Cooler, I feel so much better informed about what is going on in the world thanks in part to you. Your links and information on Covid was so important at a time of chaos. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing for Naked Capitalism. You will be missed! Agree with everything you said. Thanks for everything, Lambert! Same here. You will be missed. Agreed! Of all places to locate words of wisdom, in an early movie scene of Scarface you have Frank the cocaine boss providing advice to the young new hire, Tony Montana…” Don’t get high on your supply…”. The more this cost cutting effort goes ahead in an increasingly wild pattern, it looks like Musk is possibly violating this rule and being a bit too high and strong on his very own power sources whatever form they might be… Eventually some department heads just needed to push back, even moderately so. You can’t lead a department amid a mass exodus and mass personnel changes….well you can I suppose; people who somehow stay or stick it out really should maintain some outside recruiting contacts. As I recall there was a data science / IT technical leader who commented on being let go during a previous round of cost cutting, hope they’re finding some green pasture afterwards. Cost cutting…does sound better than wielding the proverbial axe through bureaucracy, but only a moderate improvement. This all looks like mere chaos from the cheap seats. At some point, possibly far sooner than our Boer settler colonialist friend suspects, Trump is going to have to weigh whether the money he’s making thanks to Musk compensates for lost attention and, eventually, pushback from his base and the broader public. Musk has his incel s^*+heel legion, but they could be put down if so desired. Hard to imagine Musk’s competing megalomania and antics not annoying Trump before long. A couple of things about the above articles – the measles article – and the ivermectin/HCQ article. First of all – there are some very interesting standouts as far as deviations from norms in the measles outbreak. The rate of hospitalization is extremely higher than what would be expected – and that is giving me some real concerns. My guess is that this is being spread among people who are not the healthiest to begin with- and that may be driving this. Even more interesting is the constant use of the word “unknown” when referring to the “unvaccinated”. Just so everyone will know, the use of the word “unknown” especially in the numbers it seems to be being used in this issue – is a kind of medical code word that is often specifically used for immigrants. Their vaccination status for pretty much anything is truly unknown and this is especially true after the past 4 years of no-screening wide open borders. All immigrants during the past 4 years were forced to be COVID vaccinated – despite the fact that it is a non-sterilizing vaccine incapable of preventing transmission – all the while their measles status, among others, was never checked nor were they forced to be vaccinated for it. I have had my share of unscreened immigrants in the past 2 years with all kinds of medical infectious disease issues. I have screened every last one of them for many infectious issues including measles. Every last one had negative measles antibodies – meaning they had never been vaccinated. I have vaccinated them all. BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE BORDER. Just think how much more common sense would have been had – if instead of mandating COVID vaccines which do nothing for transmission – vaccines for measles and other things THAT DO MAKE A DIFERENCE would have been mandated. It is called public health 101. My understanding of this, although all rumor and hearsay, is that immigrants were the nidus of this – but then it spread into some kind of non-vaccinating religious community, I think Mennonite – but not sure – and then exploded. Regardless – do yourselves a favor and have your kids and grandkids make sure they had MMR. Furthermore – as an adult – if you were immunized decades ago, you may be surprised that your immunity has worn off. GET CHECKED. I did – and I was found to be “inderminate” for measles immunity – so I was vaccinated again. I immediately turned off the IVM/HCQ article when they said right off the bat it was for insurance claims only….Huh? – They must have slept through the entire pandemic, especially the part where pharmacy chains et al were blacklisting docs and reporting them to boards etc. An overwhelming predominance of my patients that were using it were getting it from veterinary sources and other under the table methods. Insurance claims? Really? If that is the method they were using – it has WAY WAY undercounted the usage. And I can assure you in my world – there was no lower class predominance. The border vaccination policy you describe is shocking. I was recently surprised to learn that a measles infection comes with a bonus: it compromises immunological memory so that one is rendered vulnerable to reinfection by diseases that one would otherwise have protected from by the adaptive immune system. From Wikipedia: The measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system, which can cause deaths from other diseases.[42][43][44] Suppression of the immune system by measles lasts about two years and has been epidemiologically implicated in up to 90% of childhood deaths in third world countries, and historically may have caused rather more deaths in the United States, the UK and Denmark than were directly caused by measles.[94] Although the measles vaccine contains an attenuated strain, it does not deplete immune memory.[43] I made a misstatement in my above discussion – It should say “All LEGAL immigrants were forced to have the COVID vaccine” – it is very clear that in the chaos at the border where the illegal immigrants were concerned – there was no effort to worry about any vaccination. Nidus = “Medicine: a place in which bacteria have multiplied or may multiply; a focus of infection.” Sorry for the jargon – I try my best but it sometimes escapes. And just FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician. This is often hilarious to read. A nidus is the source of infection in a body – in epidemiological terms – a nidus is often ironically used to refer to the patient zero type individuals – the source of the epidemic. “Sorry for the jargon ” I think you are beyond splendid, and was only setting down a dictionary meaning. “FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician…” https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202502/1328947.shtml February 23, 2025 Local governments, hospitals in China embrace DeepSeek AI helps assisting public service hotline, medical record management By Li Yawei and Liang Rui A growing number of cities in China are embracing the innovative applications of DeepSeek, with some integrating it into government services to streamline repetitive tasks and hospitals leveraging it for preliminary patient diagnostics.

Latin for nest ==> French, le nid. Joining in the etymology-fest: The term “nidicolous” is also used to refer to birds who stay in the nest until grown, and also used to describe other species that mainly occupy nests of other animals, as in “nidicolous mites” or other “nidicoles” that specialize in parasitizing nesting birds and mammals. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWK January 15, 2018 Life Expectancy at Birth for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWM January 30, 2018 Infant Mortality Rate for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 Thanks Doc. We movie fans know that one of the functions of Ellis Island was to check the health status of immigrants and possibly reject them on that basis. Hence the “island.” Disease management going backwards? And of course during Covid port of entry NYC was one of the origin regions for the USA. Whatever one thinks of Musk our government managers seem to have lots of competence gaps. Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing? ” Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing”? Only if maintainance of government function while improving it is Musk’s goal. But if Musk’s goal is to destroy these government departments and agencies, then firing should outrun hiring. And Ideally hiring would be zero while doing the firing so as to destroy the targeted departments and agencies soonest. Since that is what Musk is doing, it would appear that ‘ closing competence gaps’ is not the goal here. The NIH says measles immunity from vaccines starts falling after 10-15 years! https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8189124/ Plus the MMR vaccine is a live (attenuated virus) vaccine and those generally strengthen the immune system (I have become a live vaccine fetishist). Where I am, getting a measles titer test costs more than the vaccine (and my insurance does not cover either). I could almost certainly talk my regular MD into Rxing an MMR vaccine again. Is there any reason not to do that (as long as you space it out in relation to other vaccines or interventions)? To put it another way, shouldn’t everyone over 50 assume they need an MMR vaccine again? The word disenshittification is the main thing that’s always irked me about his attempt to enhance his brand with a new word, when crapification has been a perfectly complete, and more sensible, word since the last century. Petty? Perhaps. (Probably.) The backpedalling has begun, but with hints of more mayhem to come: Elon Musk makes an admission about the productivity email his group sent to federal workers Elon Musk said that blanket emails sent to federal employees asking for a response about their weekly accomplishments or risk termination was a test to see if they “had a pulse.” Less than 24 hours before the deadline, Musk hinted that the emails were simply a ruse to ensure federal employees were “capable of responding” to his correspondence. “This was basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email,” Musk said. “This mess will get sorted out this week. Lot of people in for a rude awakening and strong dose of reality. They don’t get it yet, but they will.” On Sunday afternoon, Musk also referred to the emails as a “very basic pulse check.” That evening, Musk added that a response was indicative that employees have “two working neurons.” I think the degree of future mayhem depends on who/what was behind the backtracking. Musk hates to look a fool, and right now he does in spades. You can tell by his childish response. Since Musk is a significant driver of this stuff, and it is moving faster than any legacy systems or people can keep up, then it becomes up to individuals, along and/or in groups, to figure out how to cause Musk maximal pain so fast as to divert his energy from the great work of dismantling governance. How can millions of people destroy Tesla and force it into quick liquidation all over the world? How many people would have to leave twitterX and/or boycott all its advertisers until they leave it, in order to steer twitterX into a shrinkage spiral and then a death spiral? Thanks. He also sent an email saying the month is up and those not back in offices from work at home would be fired. Presumably another “just kidding” missive? Musk needs a muzzle. Why does Musk need a muzzle? Let Musk be Musk. Let it all hang out. Let people get a good strong whiff of the Musk-man’s true smell. From “a critical care physician and medical director of intensive care units in federal, local and rural hospitals, I am in part a government employee”: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-02-24/doge-office-of-personnel-management-uc-san-diego-veterans-affairs/ The man-children in charge still won’t respect what this doctor does or feel happiness at care brought to patients. They still think AI will do it better. Dealing with certified empathy challenged people who were selected for those traits. It is not just the federal government. This doctor is having many of the same complaints that any doctor in America working for private equity has. Here’s the latest outburst from DOGElon with commentary. https://www.reddit.com/r/1102/comments/1ix0sif/another_tweet_by_musk_about_rto/ Due to office space constraints, many federal agencies have not been able to find space for all of their teleworking and remote work employees, some of whom live thousands of miles from their head quarters. According to Musk, it appears that these individuals will be put on administrative leave and presumably laid off in 60 days. “Bad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.” –Thomas Frank I wonder what Elon will do when he realizes that the US Patent and Trademark Office is about 90 percent remote, including almost all patent examiners. Would be tragic if all Tesla (car company) and SpaceX patents were permanently deleted. Irrecoverably lost. Just gone. Not on Google, not anywhere. It could be an organized hack, who knows? Many government workers don’t have offices to go back to because it was management that sent them home. I’ve already read stories about mass layoffs in the US PTO on LinkedIn. Looks like there won’t be as many of them to rubber stamp tech bros patents … Are you sure they’re not talking about new hires who got their start date delayed or people who took the “Fork”? Nothing about a mass layoff https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/ Lambert – I don’t know if you realize how your postings and curations over these many years have been what seems now as an irreplaceable window into the realities of the world.

That’s not an assignment, just a hope and a wish. Cheers, Mazel Tov and Cent Anni to Lambert! >>>What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there Perhaps he is the designated Judas goat? And despite being almost as supine as most other politicians, he still has more of a spine than most of them? Maybe the “party” feels that Sanders actually had an email list of people who supported him, and thus he should get out there; no one else can even claim to have a popular following. I note that I received not one but two different spam text this past weeks: “Bernie here”. Yeah, sure. I now live in Iowa so maybe it was a way of hyping the rallies in PMC Fooballville (aka Iowa City). I was angry at Sanders after he dropped out in 2020. Now I just feel sorry for him having to carry water for such horrible people, to no apparent purpose, and with no possible benefits. I’ll be missing you weekday afternoons. Along with all of the substantive things Lambert has shared, and all of the substantive comments people will make in farewell, I have been grateful for all of the Clash references. ‘Ignore Alien Orders!’ And Woody Guthrie’s guitar isn’t the only machine capable of killing fascists. Thanks to the team here at NC. It is ok to hear that Sanders has followers. I guess he most people only realistic option to completely selling out. I haven’t seen any positive talk about him anywhere else or encountered any of his supporters on any of the mastodon social media i usually inhabit. I have seen things for Jill Stein, De LA Cruz etc. Lambert, thank you again for all the hard work, sophisticated explanations, and sacrifice you have given to helping knit together this wonderful website! We will miss your daily presence, and hopefully will still enjoy guest returns from time to time. Lambert – thank you for all that you have done. You have not only enlightened people – I think you have done much to save their sanity. To Lambert : Thank you for all your work and all the best in your future endeavors. RE: why Sanders is the only one at the podium Because if actual members of the Democrat party were there too, the “good billionaires” like Pritzker and Soros might have a sad. And we can’t have that lest donations be cut. The spice must flow! Lambert, not sure what you’re remaining schedule is, but thanks for everything over the years! “Your” – it wouldn’t do to allow the typo in my potentially final comment to you in WC to go unremarked. I’ve admired your meticulous grammar over many years! Lambert: masc. proper name, from French, from German Lambert, from Old High German Lambreht, from lant “land” (see land (n.)) + beraht “bright” (from PIE root *bhereg- “to shine; bright, white.”). Plantidotes and John Singer Sargent. Everything begins to make sense. https://youtu.be/lWA2pjMjpBs?si=KzwL4OCH3Io-QY0n Lambert: sharper than any diamond Your last day? Say it ain’t so! You are the very model of a Moderator General, You’ve information vegetable, animal, and mineral, You know the chiefs in Congress, and you quote the fights historical, From Medicare to Labor laws, in order categorical; Paging Edward Gorey, nice one f. Farewell, thou greatest of hamster wranglers Bosch, Smiley, Sparky the raccoon dog…. Gonna miss you Lambert. Thanks so much. Elon’s “five bullets” email debacle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yeah, one bullet is all you need when playing Russian Roulette~ Lambert, It’s been fun having you around with your keen sense of chiaroscuro, and a celebration is in order! Happy trails… Thank you for everything, Lambert, and do take care. Happy trails! If you’re ever near Hanover I’d be honored to buy you lunch and a beverage of your choice. Lambert – many will be referencing your files into the future. Take care. Wishing you well, Lambert. I’m an appreciative lurker. You rock! https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/covid-virus-evolution/681798/ COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution “But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.” I vaguely recall this being discussed on NC early in the outbreak. No? It may have been during those conversations where there seemed to be much amazement at how much previous science about viruses seemed to have went out the window. Maybe a post or two. “And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than 50 mutations—an astounding evolutionary leap. ” And the timing of that…brings something else to mind. “COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution” Please set down the science reference, if possible. I can find no journal publication reference. I didn’t write the article. Just looked like they were talking about something scientists weren’t aware of and I’m trying to remember where it seems like I heard that discussed before. “I didn’t write the article.” I am grateful for the mention of the article, but an article about scientific findings should immediately reference those findings. I am in no way challenging the post, but absent journal-published scientific findings I have no way of judging the article. Thank you so much. (Remember…) > That same month, a preprint from a group led by Ravindra Gupta The link at preprint leads to: : Neutralising antibodies in Spike mediated SARS-CoV-2 adaptation I have a long time frustration with The Atlantic’s Covid coverage. i remember something about that, as well…but Toffler’s information overload applies Lambert, I will really miss you, a lot lot! May you find new adventure on the high seas, but always remember to return home… hope we will hear from you around here once in awhile, but if this is really your quiet grand finale, then thank you ever so much Bosch! I’m so happy to see this. So much to unpack in it as always. Thank you Lambert. Tossing this out there. Acknowledging the questionable nature of the analogy, but Musk’s Legions of Decency and Economy could be equated with Ernst Roem’s Brownshirts of the early days of the NASDAP in interwar Germany. Will Trump have to stage his own version of the ‘Night of the Long Knives?’ (After the Muskshirts have done their wrecking chores. What would Kristallnacht look like on the Internet?) In this case, Trump, or his successor, already has an Enabling Act in place, thanks to the spineless Politicos of Washington. The above is not strictly snark Happy trails Lambert. I will miss you. Labor activism. When the enforcers strike, what does that mean? More than 6,500 National Guard personnel on duty as wildcat NY prison strike continues syracuse.com More than 6,500 National Guard personnel were on duty Monday to help run the New York state prison system as an illegal strike by corrections officers entered its second week. … Strikes by government employees are illegal under a section of state Civil Service Law commonly known as the Taylor Law. The current contract with the corrections officers union took effect in 2023 and lasts through next year. The involvement of the National Guard is similar to a two-week strike in 1979 when guard personnel ran prisons with the State Police. “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” There must be a movement against that kind of thing. It could be called antidisenshittificationism, a new spelling bee word. Anyway wouldn’t the HP action be deshittification? Other: I hadn’t heard about raccoon dogs before. I only knew about wiener dogs. Lambert, OMG just catching up with earlier comments. I’m going to miss you. Make sure to check in with your NC homies here now and then. Bizarre – I’m just noticing now after years, that Gonzalo Lira (the US journalist passed/killed by Ukraine) had a pretty bad dust-up with Steve Keen a decade ago – I had even contacted Steve at the time to let him know of a ‘website malfunction’ caused by the aftermath of this, and learned of Lira’s involvement then (without knowing anything about him then). Weird how short the degrees of separation are – I see he has had stuff cross-posted here at NC at times, as well, ‘back in the day’. Moving to USA as a Brit is bewildering in many ways. Finding out that the American robin is a completely different bird was one. Beautiful :) Re: hanging up the Yellow Waders? But where to hang them? Some artistic placement is needed. Best wishes Lambert! Thanks for all the conversation and links over the years. I hope your next endeavor is everything you want it to be. Re the “patrimonialism” piece, the thing to note is that the Weberian state was always an ideal, not ever a real thing, even if we came closer to it every now and then. As an academic acquaintance put it, “meritocracy” simply meant people who have “merit” (whatever that is) get the right to give stuff to their friends via government. The real question, as I see it, is whether people who don’t have this “merit” can recognize this as something worth yielding to? Are the “meritorious” so powerful that they can’t be challenged? (This would be the unstable path) Or, do they produce such public benefit, even if it’s not their primary goal, that the masses are willing to tolerate them? (This is actually Mancur Olson’s argument–more important insight than the collective action stuff, I think.) This runs counter to what “meritocrats” today think “merit” means–just credentials, whether they actually produce anything useful, or not–actual raw power through which they can assert their rule or something useful for enough others so that they would tolerate your rule.). So today’s meritocrats are just bandits, not the bandits with some “redeeming” values that Olson saw. This cannot be a stable thing…. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Apple says it will spend $500 billion in US over next four years as it faces down Trump tariffs

Spending is said to include over 20,000 new American workers and the production of servers in Texas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple today announced a plan to spend $500 billion in the United States in the next four years, including in jobs, suppliers, and building servers. This comes as Apple — like most consumer electronics companies — faces down a threat of tariffs from importing goods and components from China and other countries from President Donald Trump.The company says this is its biggest US-focused spending plan to date. Beyond jobs, it includes paying US-based suppliers, including factories owned by Texas Instruments and TSMC. Apple will build servers for Apple Intelligence at a facility in Houston, and claims it will increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and establish an "academy" in Michigan to "train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering." Following a meeting between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, Trump said that Cook was ceasing plants in Mexico and would increase its spend in the US. “They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” he told U.S. state governors. It's unclear which Mexican facilities Trump was referring to, though Apple supplier Foxconn has some plants there, Bloomberg points out.The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on goods imported from China and has mentioned, but not yet enacted, a 25% tariff on chips.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018 during the first Trump administration, including jobs and a campus in Austin, Texas. It's unclear which, if any, of the investments discussed recently were previously planned prior to Trump entering office for his second term. During the first term, Trump took credit for Apple's Mac Pro plant run by a contractor, which was already in operation.In 2021, Apple announced more U.S.-based spending plans, including a $430 billion investment including a North Carolina campus, as well as jobs in silicon engineering and research and development. (That campus is currently on pause)."We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a press release. Notably, the hiring commitments come at a time when much of big tech is going through layoffs.Cook's plans for US investments helped Apple during Trump's first terms, earning it exceptions from some tariffs on its biggest devices, including the iPhone. This time around, it appears other tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman and former CEO Jeff Bezos, are trying to follow Cook's playbook by cultivating relationships with the president.

Title: ‘They got to get rid of it somehow’: Shopper buys 24-pack of Sprite from Walmart. Then they open up the cans
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-sprite-coca-cola/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T16:00:00Z

Stace Fernandez This Walmart shopper found something really strange in her Sprite cans. Now, viewers are starting to speculate. Sprite, known for its iconic lemon-lime flavor, is known to be a clear drink, unlike sodas like Dr.Pepper and Coca-Cola, which are brown, and even ginger ale, which has a slight yellow tinge. That’s why this woman was so freaked out once she started pouring the soda she just bought. In a trending TikTok, Walmart shopper Meagan McGee (@themeaganmcgee) shared the offputting thing she found when she went to open a Sprite. The clip garnered more than 200,000 views total, as it was posted twice. See, her husband just went to Walmart and picked up a 24-pack of Sprite. But when McGee opened one, the liquid inside was a dark brown. Maybe it was a fluke with just one soda being accidentally filled? That doesn’t seem to be the case. McGee had already poured out two cans, and the third had the same contents. “Every single one of these is pouring out Coke. Make it make sense,” McGee says. Now, the most logical explanation is that Coca-Cola and Sprite are owned by the same parent company. A big mistake may have been made during the packing process, and Sprite cans were incorrectly filled. But commenters have their own, potentially less plausible, theories. “I wonder to make up for the difference in sales coke cola is being sold as other products just a hunch,” a person said, referring to the Coke boycotts. “Thanks but i like my soda companies with no ICE,” another added, also in refence to the boycott. “I did some quality work in that industry and there is a way to track back to the technician who signed off for that particular can,” a commenter claimed. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Coca-Cola did donate to Trump. The soda brand was added to this boycott list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021.

Title: Review: Space to Grow
URL: https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4940/1
Time Published: 2025-02-24T11:57:00Z
Full Content:
Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier by Matthew Weinzierl and Brendan Rosseau Harvard Business Review Press, 2025 hardcover, 320 pp., illus. ISBN 978-1-64782-716-8 US$32 At Blue Origin, the company with the motto “Gradatim ferociter” or “step by step ferociously,” the steps have been a little more ferocious so far this year. The company finally conducted its first New Glenn orbital launch in January, a mission that was mostly successful other than a failed booster landing. Earlier this month, the company launched its New Shepard suborbital vehicle, demonstrating the ability to provide simulated lunar gravity for the payloads inside for about two minutes. This week, the company will launch another New Shepard carrying six private astronauts. But, earlier this month, the company also announced it was laying off about 10% of its workforce, at least 1,000 employees. Dave Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company had created “more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed” as it grew significantly in recent years. The layoffs were intended to address those concerns, reducing both engineering and management positions. Limp, a longtime Amazon executive, was hired a little more than a year ago by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos to make the company more decisive. ““He said he didn’t think Blue needed another rocket scientist,” Limp said of Bezos at the Commercial Space Conference in Washington a day before he announced the layoffs. “What we needed was a little bit more organization, a little more decisiveness, some manufacturing expertise.” Those events demonstrated that technical success is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success in commercial space: companies, even those backed by billionaires, must eventually demonstrate that they can provide a product that meets the needs of customers and in a way that is financially sustainable. That is at the core of Space to Grow, a new book by Matthew Weinzierl, a professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), and Brendan Rosseau, a former teaching fellow and research associate there. The authors, who created a space economics project at HBS, make clear they see tremendous opportunity for the commercial space industry thanks to the reduced costs to build and launch spacecraft and the growing value of services provided by those satellites in communications, Earth observation, and other sectors. But while they call this a “revolution,” this is book is not an uncritical, overzealous look at the space industry, but one grounded in the rigors of economics. Many of the chapters in the book are case studies of some major space companies: Blue Origin, Planet, SpaceX, and others. Those chapters trace the rise (and sometimes fall: one of the profiled companies is defunct asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources) of these companies, including how they responded to, and sometimes reshaped, the markets. That is tied to what can be considered the book’s central theme, that under certain conditions, markets are efficient. They use economic concepts throughout the book to support their analyses of the companies they profile. Those concepts range from simple supply-and-demand curves to more advanced concepts like the Le Chatelier principle, which explains how decreasing the cost of the supply of a product or service may create only modest increases in demand in the short term, but larger changes in the long term as the market takes more advantage of that less expensive supply. Fortunately, you do not need a background in economics to appreciate that: Weinzierl and Rosseau do a good job explaining those concepts in plain language. They acknowledge that, despite that central theme, markets are not always efficient. They discuss market failures like orbital debris, where there are limited incentives for satellite operators to pay to clean up their defunct satellites, along with regulatory obstacles. They also cite concerns of monopoly power that SpaceX in particular holds in the launch sector; competition, they note, is one of those “certain conditions” required for markets to be efficient. Much of the background about the companies in the book will be familiar to readers, but the economic framing is useful for people inside and outside the industry alike. The authors stop short of making specific recommendations for companies or policymakers, but it’s clear they see potential for efficient markets to enable further growth of the industry. In light of the recent events at Blue Origin, it was worth examining that chapter in detail to review their assessment of the company. A “monumental turning point” for the company, in the words of former president Rob Meyerson, was the decision not to bid on the next phase of NASA’s commercial crew program in 2012 after participating in earlier phases. By doing so, Weinzierl and Rosseau state, Blue Origin was “denying itself the discipline imposed by the market forces that are at the heart of the commercial space revolution’s promise” and acting more like a “philanthropic nonprofit than like a space startup.” That appears to be changing now, both with Blue Origin’s technical accomplishments and its internal shakeups. “We have made a lot of progress in the past year on fundamentals and acting quickly and turning us into a world-class manufacturing company, and focusing the company,” Limp said at the Commercial Space Conference. “I think we’ve made some progress. We have a lot to do this year, too.” Note: the authors provided me with a galley of Space to Grow and requested a blurb about the book, which was included in the published version. That blurb reflected my sincere opinion of the book, described in far greater detail in this review.

Title: Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? - The Pragmatic Engineer

Time Published: 2025-02-24T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. This article is an excerpt from last week's The Pulse, issue – full subscribers received the below details seven days ago. To get articles like this in your inbox, subscribe here. Many subscribers expense the newsletter – if you have a learning & development budget, here's an email you could send to your manager. Before we start: despite the below stats, the tech market is not all gloom and doom! This week, we covered pockets of the tech industry that are seeing more demand than before in the issue State of the startup and scaleup hiring markets – as seen by recruiters. Interesting data from jobs site Indeed shows the change in the number of active software developer job listings on the site. For context, Indeed is the largest job aggregator portal in the US and in several countries, and it crawls vacancies on other sites, too. This means that Indeed aims to track most of the posted jobs across a given region (via crawling and processing them) – not just the ones companies pay to post on Indeed. The overall picture looks pretty grim, right now: Since February 2020, Indeed has shared aggregated statistics on the number of active jobs listings, taking January 2020 to be 100%, as a reference. Facts about software developer jobs on Indeed: Indeed tracks international job markets, too. Canada has virtually the same graph as the US. Things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and Australia: Trends look similar across the world. Australia’s growth in software engineer positions is eye-catching because it’s higher, and it’s the only country where the number of jobs listed is not lower than in 2020. Section 174 — the accounting change effective from 2023, mandating software engineering costs to be amortised over 5 years is most likely to result in fewer software developer jobs in the US, as we have previously analyzed. The drop in jobs somewhat lines up with when this change became effective. However, Section 174 only impacts the US and US-headquarters companies. its impact would only be visible from early 2024 — and the drop since 2022 can in no way be attributed to it. Section 174 changes also do not explain why countries the UK and France see a similar drop in job postings. This suggests that although Section 174 changes in the US surely have an impact: this accounting rule change is not the main driver of this drop. What about the number of total jobs in other industries? The data: Across Indeed, 10% more jobs are listed today in February 2025 than were in February 2020. There are 35% fewer listings for software developers. Let’s dig a little deeper into which other industries are also experiencing a drop: The change in the number of listings in 2025, compared to 2020, for each of these areas: Hospitality and tourism openings are also down by 18%. Overall, software developer jobs have seen the biggest boom and bust in vacancies. No other segment saw hiring more than double in 2022; only banking came close. At the same time, hiring has fallen faster in software development in the last 2-3 years than anywhere else So, which areas have grown since 2020? Several sectors saw job listings go up, significantly: Growth rates compared to five years ago: The numbers don’t lie, job listings for devs have plummeted. There’s a few potential reasons why: Interest rate changes explain most of the drop. The end of zero percent interest rates is a mega-trend that affects many things across the economy since 2022, including hiring, the steep fall in VC funding, and how many tech startups survive, thrive, or die. But it doesn’t explain why highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon or Google have slowed down their hiring, or the large layoffs in recent years at tech’s biggest workplaces. The tech sector seems to react to sudden events with more intensity than any other industry. There is no other industry that started to hire in the frenzy than the tech industry did in 2022 – and then no other industry cut back hiring in 2024-2025. Let’s compare it with the industry that had the second-largest hiring boom during COVID: banking and finance. The job posting slowdown could partially be explained by how much more tech companies hired during the pandemic-era boom, and that companies are well-staffed thanks to that boom. Of course, we cannot deny that developer jobs – as well as banking jobs – are underperforming, compared to job listings across the economy: GenAI impact – yay or nay? We know first-hand that coding is an area in which Large Language Models are really helpful. Indeed, would it be so surprising if coding goes on to become the single best area of all that LLMs thrive in? The discipline looks tailor-made for it: Could tech companies be hiring less thanks to anticipating productivity boost that GenAI tools could bring for existing engineers? I don’t really buy this logic: but I can see how several companies could do a “wait and see” approach, slowing down hiring or even pausing it while they gather more data. A perception that engineering is no longer a bottleneck could be a reason for lower hiring. As covered in January, Salesforce will keep software engineering headcount flat because it’s seen a 30% productivity gain from AI tools. Salesforce has an interest in making AI productivity sound compelling because it sells an AI offering called Agentforce, and the company can afford to hire 1,000 additional salespeople to sell its new products it’s built. This suggests there’s substance in the reported productivity gain; Salesforce might be building software faster than it can sell it. Playing the devil’s advocate, this also raises the possibility that Salesforce isn’t building the right products, if it needs to hire more agents to sell its products, despite already having a strong distribution network and partnerships. Still too many engineers, after overrecruitment in 2021-2022? The period was the hottest tech jobs market of all time, and companies hired at a record pace. In 2023, widespread layoffs followed. Sluggish hiring today could be an indicator that companies still have enough “excess hires” from 2022. Perhaps some companies feel they hired too quickly before, and are going slower now. Are smaller teams more efficient? The two companies below hire slowly, and have small engineering teams: Could we be approaching the point at which building products is simpler to do for one or two engineers? Not because of LLMs, but how languages like Typescript allow working across the backend and frontend (using e.g. Node.js on the backend and React and React Native on the frontend and web). Of course, LLMs make onboarding to different stacks easier than ever. Consider how Indeed job postings will not be fully accurate data. There is a fair chance that Indeed is becoming less popular as a destination to post jobs – especially software engineering jobs – and that Indeed is either not crawling, or banned from crawling them. For example, Indeed lists a total of 663 jobs from Microsoft – however, Microsoft has more than 1,000 jobs just with the words “software” in them listed. I also struggled to find several startup jobs advertised on sites like Workatastartup (the job board for Y Combinator companies) listed on Indeed. I suspect that Indeed’s data should be directionally correct, and there are indeed fewer developer job listings than before. But I don’t think this data is representative enough of startup hiring, and it probably doesn’t track Big Tech hiring all that well either. Data shows that in 2023, the number of software engineers dropped for the first time in 20 years, fuelled by layoffs. It’s predicted that growth in the tech industry is likely to be low this year, and most certainly well below growth between 2011-2021 growth. I see a few possibilities: Smaller engineering teams get more productive. This is the optimistic outlook, where LLMs add a big boost to both individual and team productivity, which leads to more engineering teams being spun up, across the industry. More startups could be founded, and traditional companies could bring development in-house. The industry stagnates / shrinks. In this pessimistic outlook, even as software becomes cheaper to produce with fewer engineers needed, companies produce the same software, but with fewer people. This also assume entrepreneurs will not jump at the opportunity to build their ideas more efficiently – and much cheaper than before! I cannot see the scenario of the shrinking industry playing out – not with good software missing from so many parts of the world, and building better software being a big business opportunity in some many other industries. LLMs make software development more accessible for non-developers: I’m sure that LLMs are a leading cause of the fall in software developer job postings: there’s uncertainty at large companies about whether to hire as fast as previously, given the productivity hype around AI tooling, and businesses are opting to “wait and see” by slowing down recruitment, as a result. Startups are finding that smaller teams are working fine, and that it pays off to hire slower – as Linear and Bluesky are doing – and to avoid the “hyperscaling” approach of hiring first and asking what the new workers will actually do, later. Big Tech will hire slower than before, and I don’t see startups speeding up hiring. What’s missing is an answer to the question: how much new software will be created by non-developers using AI tools, for which a lot more developers will be needed to grow and maintain those new solutions?

Title: Software engineering job openings hit 5-year low amid industry shift
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106878-software-engineering-job-openings-plummet-35-five-year.html
Time Published: 2025-02-22T15:50:00Z

Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent). The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak. Trend in software development job postings in various countries - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz. He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring. Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a "wait and see" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams. Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople. The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes. All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data. So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

Title: The best trade in the market might be following everything Elon Musk touches

Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.

The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust

Time Published: 2025-02-20T18:15:38Z

Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fund big AI bets

Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse.
