Title: Executives Don’t See AI Undercutting Jobs Yet

ByJoe McKendrick, Senior Contributor. AI a job killer? While AI gets partially the blame for headline-grabbing layoffs such as Amazon shedding 14,000 employees, it’s notable that more than five million people still get hired monthly within the United States. The latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the hiring rate at 5,126,000 for the month of August. Less than two in 10 executives, at most, foresee job cuts as a result of AI in their own organizations, according to the authors of a new study of 800 business leaders out of University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and GBK Collective. If anything, 40% expect AI to help boost hiring of entry-level jobs, while another 40% say their hiring patterns will not change. Only 18% foresee AI decreasing entry-level job opportunities. Likewise, 33% of executives expect AI to increase hiring of executives, and another 54% expect no effect on the sizes of their executive staffs. This is the third year for this particular study, conducted by Wharton’s Human-AI Research (WHAIR) center. Some parts of the business will see the greater impact from AI than others. IT departments lead the pack, with 47% affected by AI, up from 30% in the 2023 survey. Purchasing and procurement comes in at 39%, up from 14% just two years ago. At least 37% of product development and engineering departments will be reshaped by AI, up from 22% in the 2023 survey. When it comes to measuring relative success rates with generative AI, the Wharton study paints a generally positive picture. A few weeks back, a lot of eyebrows were being raised about MIT researchers’ estimates that only five percent of generative AI projects are showing tangible results in businesses. The current Wharton study, on the other hand, finds at least three in four enterprises, 74%, are already seeing positive returns on their genAI investments, the Wharton survey finds. These results are based on solid ROI metrics such as productivity, profitability and throughput. The successes with AI were self-reported in the Wharton/GBK study, as the co-authors note that they “intentionally asked the question about ROI for gen AI in a fairly broad way to allow leaders to essentially answer according to their own definition.” Are executives compelled to portray a rosier picture of their efforts? Who knows, right? Perhaps there is greater comfort with AI. Close to half of these executives, 46%, now use gen AI on a daily basis in their work. A majority, 82%, use it weekly. On average, 82% business leaders expect their AI investments to pay off in just two to three years. With the technology evolving almost every day, the greatest inhibitor is “skill atrophy” — meaning it takes talent and training, not just technology, to fully succeed with AI. Decision-makers see gen AI as a supplement to human capital (89% agree), more than a replacement (71% agree). Still, 43% agree that gen AI will lead to declines in proficiency. The higher you go up the corporate hierarchy, the more optimism you find pertaining to gen AI. Leaders at the vice-president level and above are much more optimistic about early ROI for their gen AI investments compared to mid-managers, with 45% reporting significantly positive returns (defined as greater than 20% ROI) versus only 27% of mid-managers. Mid-managers, the survey shows, are more cautious, and are twice as likely to say it is “too early to tell/still in pilot phase” (16% versus 8% of senior leaders).

Title: General Motors to slash nearly 1,700 jobs across the US amid EV demand concerns– who will be impacted?

GM layoffs: General Motors (GM) announced on Wednesday plans to cut US electric vehicle and battery production. It will lay off 1,200 workers at its Detroit EV plant and 550 at a battery plant in Ohio, as a response to a slowdown in battery car demand, Reuters reported. In January, the automaker said it would pause battery cell production at two US joint-venture battery plants in Tennessee and Ohio for nearly six months. Meanwhile, GM will temporarily lay off 5,500 employees across three plants. This includes 3,400 workers furloughed at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where the electric Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Hummer EVs are produced. The company stated on Wednesday that it will evaluate the required level of production and reinstate approximately 2,200 of those employees in January when the plant resumes operations on a single shift. The remaining 1,200 will be furloughed indefinitely, Bloomberg reported. The layoffs come as several companies announce job cuts. E-commerce giant Amazon recently confirmed it will slash 14,000 jobs across departments amid its push for artificial intelligence (AI). From January, GM will reduce production at its Detroit EV plant to one shift, down from the current two, following previous layoffs at the facility. This change will decrease output by roughly 50%. The plant manufactures three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, along with the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV. General Motors said the production and job cuts were “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.” Last month, it lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements, the report said. US automakers are significantly reducing their EV plans, expecting a rapid decline in consumer demand once the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires. Experts say that EV sales could potentially drop by 50% in the upcoming months after surpassing 10% of total US car sales this summer, the report said. Nissan, Jeep-maker Stellantis, and other automakers have halted plans for upcoming electric models. Earlier in October, GM announced it was cancelling the production of its Brightdrop electric van, citing slow progress in the commercial EV van market. GM has revised its outlook for EV sales downward and implemented additional EV production cuts this year. United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain criticised GM for the job cuts, highlighting that the company increased its expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. "The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond," the report quoted Fain. The company said it cut around 500 white-collar jobs in the last week. In 2021, GM announced plans to shift to all EV sales by 2035 and increased investment, but it has since scaled back its efforts amid dwindling demand. Last week, GM CEO Mary Barra said, "With an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it's clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned." She also hoped that the automaker would reduce EV losses from 2026 onwards. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Amazon kick-started an answer this week. On Tuesday, the Jeff Bezos-owned tech giant cut 14,000 workers across its corporate workforce. Amazon said the deep cuts were the latest in CEO Andy Jassey's plan to have the firm act "like the world's largest startup." Business Insider's tech team used internal documents to reveal how Amazon's top brass shared the news, what they told workers who were laid off, and their advice for the staff who remained. But all eyes are now on what comes next — not just for Amazon but companies beyond Silicon Valley as artificial intelligence rattles a frozen job market. Is AI behind Amazon's decision to lay off 14,000 employees, and will more companies follow suit with layoffs of their own? Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito joined Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to discuss. Kim broke news about the divisions of Amazon hit hardest by the layoffs, while Ito's latest piece explored how Amazon's full-throttle approach to layoffs could be a warning sign of more AI-related job cuts. In our chat, Kim and Ito tackled Amazon's business case for the layoffs, looked ahead to the company's earnings, and flagged what white-collar workers should watch for in this new age of AI.

YouTube is offering employee buyouts as part of a major reorganization, CEO Neal Mohan said on Wednesday in a memo to staffers that was obtained by Business Insider. "Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform," Mohan wrote. "We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity." Mohan said YouTube, which is owned by Google, was creating three separate product organizations that would report directly to him: viewer products, creator and community products, and subscriptions products. No layoffs were planned as part of the reorganization, which is set to take effect on November 5. "But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan said, adding the YouTube employees in the United States would be receiving more information about the buyout option. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several companies have recently made cuts to their workforce — in part due to AI. Amazon announced this week that it was slashing more than 14,000 jobs in order to position itself to innovate faster in the age of AI. Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported record earnings on Wednesday, achieving its first-ever $100 billion quarter. Read Mohan's full memo to YouTube employees below: Jump to

Title: Amazon Denies That AWS Just Went Down Again After Mass Layoffs

By Joe Wilkins Published Oct 29, 2025 5:29 PM EDT Staff at Amazon are still reeling from a fresh round of layoffs that saw thousands of corporate workers lose their job as execs appeared to sacrifice employees for their topline. In a memo to all Amazon workers, Beth Galetti, the company’s senior vice president of HR, bragged that “some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti beamed. Mileage may vary. The layoffs from earlier this week came hot on the heels of an unprecedented Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that took out a major chunk of the world internet, from Snapchat to ChatGPT. Early financial loss estimates say the damages from that could amount to over half a billion dollars when all the dust settles. Those bad optics were compounded by prior rounds of layoffs over the summer, specifically in AWS’s cloud computing unit, which lost hundreds of employees. In July, AWS CEO Andy Jassy enthused that “generative AI and agents” were changing “the way work is done” in the company’s internet services division — though it remains to be seen if the tech is truly up for the task. And the fun isn’t over yet. Today, users on Downdetector started reporting another AWS outage that they said was affecting airport websites, gaming systems, and “countless internet webpages,” as flagged by The Independent. The disruption even affected Heathrow Airport in London, the UK’s biggest. Even the Scottish Parliament was affected by the turmoil, opting to suspend a voting session due to the network issues. Amazon disputed the outage reports, though — and seemed to suggest that users were blaming it for an outage at Microsoft’s Azure. “There are no issues with AWS services, and all AWS services are operating normally,” it wrote on a status page. “We are aware that an operational issue at another infrastructure provider may be impacting some customers’ applications and networks.” A full postmortem will be up to the internet infrastructure wonks, but Tom‘s Guide noted that Azure and AWS are intertwined in “key ways,” making it hard to diagnose specifically what’s going wrong in real time. The lesson for Amazon is clear, though: successive waves of layoffs as leadership sings the praises of AI to replace workers make AWS an easy target when things break online. “Either way,” Tom’s writes, “for people who rely on Azure- or AWS-backed services, it probably doesn’t matter which one is causing the problem — all that matters is they can’t do what they need to.” More on Amazon: Leaked Document Shows Amazon Scheming to Keep AI Data Center Water Use Secret I’m a tech and transit correspondent for Futurism, where my beat includes transportation, infrastructure, and the role of emerging technologies in governance, surveillance, and labor.

Title: ServiceNow CEO says AI is reorienting the global economy

Every time Alistair publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. AI is reorienting the global economy in radical ways, and the effects are spreading from consumers to companies, says Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, an enterprise software giant. McDermott, a veteran of the software industry who previously led European tech giant SAP, chatted with me as his company reported third-quarter results on Wednesday. We spoke about AI disruptions to the job market, the AI spending boom, and the threat of generative AI to the software industry. The big Amazon layoffs this week have reignited concerns about the impact of this powerful new technology on the job market. McDermott said the economy will certainly undergo fundamental changes due to AI. "AI is going to reorient the global economy," he told me in an interview. Individual consumers have already benefited from this by having access to powerful AI chatbots and models that answer questions in new ways. Next, enterprises, such as companies, governments, and other large organizations, will see gains from this technology, the CEO said. "This is the biggest breakthrough in enterprise technology in half a century," McDermott added. For ServiceNow itself, the CEO said generative AI is encouraging the company to hire more in certain areas, while re-skilling existing staff. "What good is AI if it doesn't serve the greater good of people?" McDermott said. "We use agents in support of our employees, which enable us to hire more people." ServiceNow is hiring "feet on street," which includes salespeople, technology architects and designers, and forward-deployed engineers who can help companies set up new AI and other tech projects in weeks, he said. "And we're retooling and reassessing the skills of every employee, and retraining people to build the workforce of the future," McDermott said. With trillions of dollars being spent on AI infrastructure, I asked the ServiceNow CEO if he's seeing evidence of gains that would justify such heavy spending. "Your point you make is right on," he responded, while saying that most digital transformation projects fail, and 95% of early corporate AI initiatives are not delivering a return on investment. He said ServiceNow has built its software to help companies handle the complexity of new AI projects. "Our platform is that single, clean pane of glass that overcomes digital transformation problems," McDermott said. "It resides above that messy legacy data layer and works across functions and digital processes. No one has time to rip and replace all that legacy mess." ServiceNow shares have been pressured this year by concern about the potential impact of generative AI. Some investors worry that AI coding tools and similar technology could make it easier for companies to build their own software, rather than buying it from software-as-a-service vendors such as ServiceNow. When I asked McDermott whether ServiceNow customers are building their own versions of the company's software, he was unruffled. "No, they can't duplicate what they took 20 years to build," the CEO said. ServiceNow offers enterprise features for IT, operations, employee, customer experience, and engineering on the same product, he said. "That is not what OpenAI and Anthropic, or Gemini, do," he added. "Companies are still running the ServiceNow platform to execute their business missions." ServiceNow delivered another strong quarter, raising its full-year outlook as demand for its AI-powered offerings accelerated. The company's board also approved a five-for-one stock split. The company reported third-quarter subscription revenue of $3.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Revenue reached $3.4 billion, also a 22% increase. ServiceNow raised its 2025 guidance for subscription revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow. McDermott credited the surge to companies accelerating their adoption of ServiceNow's AI capabilities. ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono said that AI products, such as Now Assist, Workflow Data Fabric, and RaptorDB, have exceeded internal plans, showing strong uptake across both new and existing customers. The company highlighted 103 deals worth more than $1 million in net new annual contract value and 553 customers exceeding $5 million. ServiceNow also highlighted the success of its new AI Experience interface and the Zurich product for building scalable AI systems. The company's investments in AI innovation and partnerships, spanning Nvidia, FedEx, and government agencies, show deepening integration of AI into enterprise workflows.

Title: Amazon Games Division Faces ‘Significant’ Job Cuts Amid 14,000 Layoffs: Report

Amazon is making sweeping cuts across its video game division as part of a larger round of layoffs affecting more than 14,000 corporate employees, according to Bloomberg. A company memo sent out on Tuesday confirmed “significant role reductions” in its Games unit, particularly affecting offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division. The move follows Amazon’s announcement earlier this week that it will eliminate 14,000 corporate roles as part of broader “organizational changes,” giving most affected employees 90 days to find new roles internally. Steve Boom, Amazon’s Vice President of Audio, Twitch, and Games, said in the memo that the company is “leaning into the things that Amazon does best.” That includes scaling back development on big-budget titles — especially massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) — and focusing instead on smaller, cloud-based and AI-driven projects. The company’s Montreal studio will continue developing March of Giants, a strategy title, while external partners like Crystal Dynamics and Maverick Games remain at work on a new Tomb Raider game and a racing title, respectively. Amazon’s cloud gaming platform, Luna, will also continue to receive new “casual and AI-focused” games. The company recently relaunched Luna in Canada with a major overhaul, featuring an updated interface, new multiplayer options, and free games for Prime members, all playable across nearly any device without a console. Amazon’s retreat from big-budget games comes as it sunsets New World: Aeternum, its ambitious MMO that peaked at more than 900,000 concurrent players when it launched in 2021. The company said the recently released Nighthaven update will serve as the game’s final content drop, with servers remaining online through 2026. The changes mark another reset for Amazon’s decade-long push into gaming, which has produced only a handful of notable hits. In its blog post announcing the end of development for New World, the company acknowledged: “We’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” As Amazon tightens its focus around Luna and smaller-scale experiences, it’s clear the company is taking a more conservative approach to gaming — one centred on long-term efficiency rather than blockbuster ambition.

Another's "get ready with me" video turned sour after she said she'd learned her fate. With as many as 14,000 Amazon employees set to lose their jobs, some workers who said they were laid off by the e-commerce company are posting through it on social media. Several of them are sharing updates in real time as they process their feelings about the reductions. The person who posted the "get ready with me" video, for example, had planned to take her followers along with her for a morning run when she said he learned she was affected by the cuts. "I no longer have a job to go to after I go running," the TikToker said in one of her videos. Get ready with me to go to work!!! Except I got laid off this morning! Shoutout to you Amazon🤍🤍 I’m about to be poor so please donate to my charity link pinned to the comments!!!!! #amazon #layoffs #fyp A few others are posting almost hourly updates on how they're doing since the cuts were announced. One user, who said she's on vacation in Mauritius, posted a video two hours after she said she learned she was laid off. She said it was "divine intervention." "I'm not freaking out," she said. "I'm also still very much in shock." #techlayoffs #amazon Others don't seem to be taking it so well. One TikTok creator who said she worked at Amazon told followers on Tuesday, when the company announced the layoffs, to place bets on whether she'd be affected. The next day, she said she'd been let go after more than eight years at the company. Since then, her updates have been a mix of jokes, including telling her cats the news, and crying videos. One of her videos has gone viral, with nearly 200,000 views in less than 24 hours. Amazon layoff breakdown begins Some posts were bittersweet. One person who said their Amazon Games studio was affected said they would work with their team again "in a heartbeat." Just got laid off from Amazon Games San Diego(including like 99% of the studio), the team I worked with was incredible and I will miss all of them. If I had the opportunity to work with them again I would take it in a heartbeat! Others hit the ground running on LinkedIn, changing their status on the professional networking platform to "#OpenToWork" and asking connections for leads on open positions. On Reddit, dozens of people have begun crowdsourcing a list of affected roles and divisions to determine which areas were hit the hardest. Posting through the pain of being laid off isn't a new concept. Many people, specifically Gen Zers, have gone viral in posts about losing their jobs. It's all about validating their feelings about being fired and seeking human connection, one workplace researcher told Business Insider in 2024. Amazon declined to comment on the social media posts. This week, one woman said she was working in her "dream role" as a social media manager at Amazon before being laid off less than a month after celebrating her one-year anniversary in the position and a week before her birthday.

Title: As Amazon's game business crumbles, the public is surprised to discover that it was trying to compete with Steam all this time

If you're wondering how it all went so wrong, former VP Ethan Evans might be able to shed some light on things. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. September 30, 2016 was a big day for Amazon Game Studios: It was on that day, at TwitchCon, it unveiled Breakaway, Crucible, and New World, signalling a major push into the realm of big-budget game development. Not quite a decade later, we find ourselves standing amidst the rubble of that once-great ambition, with a single question on our minds: What the hell went wrong? Because things very definitely did go wrong. First, Amazon halted development of Breakaway in 2018 after some iffy previews and an open alpha that failed to impress. It followed that up by not halting development of Crucible, even though it probably should have given that Crucible ended up being 'un-released' just a month after it went live and was ultimately canned outright. And yesterday, it nailed the trifecta: New World, despite appearing to be at least a moderate success (which makes it a big success by Amazon standards) was brought to an end: Amazon said the game will continue to run until at least the end of 2026 (although it also said New World would remain available for purchase, a commitment that held up for about 12 hours) but active development is over. Various other whiffs have been interspersed throughout—failed games, forgotten game stores, that sort of thing—but for me, the fates of those three games really encapsulate Amazon's gaming misadventure: Big talk, half-assed execution, ugly endings, all of it leading to yesterday's announcement of major layoffs at Amazon Games. Of course there's no single answer to the question of what the hell went wrong, because obviously a lot of things did. But the end of New World, and seemingly of Amazon's gaming ambitions as a whole, bring to mind what former Prime Gaming vice president Ethan Evans had to say about it earlier this year—essentially, that hubris and money are a dangerous combination. Amazon's overarching goal, according to a LinkedIn post we reported on in February, was to "disrupt the game platform Steam." No problemo, right? As Evans wrote on LinkedIn, "We were at least 250x bigger [than Steam]," and that's a pretty good starting point. Ah, but problemo indeed. "The 15+ year long attempt to challenge Steam started before I was VP of Prime Gaming, but we never cracked the code," Evans wrote. "Not under my leadership or anyone else's." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Twitch tried to break into the digital marketplace via acquisition, and failed; then it tried to build its own storefront into Twitch, which was also a bust. Then it built the cloud gaming service Luna, which went largely unnoticed. Steam, meanwhile, continued its uncontested dominance of PC gaming, ably guided by Gabe Newell and a potato. "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits," Evans admitted in his February LinkedIn post. "We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available. "We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it." The extent of Amazon's failure to crack the Steam nut is revealed in the fact that not only did it fail to compete, but lots of people didn't even know it was trying in the first place. That's, uhh, really not a good sign. Today I learned amazon had a platform competing against Steam. lol Amazon: "you took everything from me" Steam: Amazon was OFFICIALLY competing against Steam this whole time? I’ve had steam since it was a thing, and this is quite literally the first time I’ve heard they have a game store Like I knew about New World or whatever their MMORPG was but that’s it. Amazon isn't giving up on games entirely, but it's shifting focus away from major productions like New World to stuff like the AI-powered Snoop Dogg game where he's a judge. I'm sure that'll work out much better. Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Former World of Warcraft and League of Legends MMO lead says replacing devs with AI is "a little bit premature" - "AI may one day accelerate game development. But it's not happening today"

"All of these layoffs are just to cut opex and make the stock prices go up. It will lead to empty portfolios for the next few years" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A former Blizzard and Riot Games lead developer says there may come a time when AI can competently displace human game developers, but that day is not today. Over on Twitter, Greg Street, who was lead systems designer on World of Warcraft from 2008 to 2013, and then filled various lead roles at Riot Games including executive producer on the League of Legends MMO until 2023, touched on the harrowing topic of AI and its capabilities in the game dev space. "AI may one day accelerate game development. But it's not happening today," said Street. "All of these layoffs are just to cut opex and make the stock prices go up. It will lead to empty portfolios for the next few years." Street was seemingly responding to this week's mass layoffs at Amazon, the gutting of Amazon Games, and the ending of new development on the studio's fantasy MMO, New World. In a follow-up tweet, he commented, "I'm sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream alive." Further reflecting on the seemingly unending downsizing in the games industry, Street said: "I mean layoffs happen for lots of reasons. But if a company is claiming they don't need workers because AI is going to make their games or movies or books today, that's a little premature. (It's better at music.)" It definitely feels like generative AI hasn't reached a point where it can make mechanically and narratively compelling games, although I take great issue with the suggestion that AI music is anything other than auditory torture. Still, in response to a commenter, Street predicted AI will soon "be able to do terrain or say a billion weapon variants," but argued "it's a long way from being able to tell cohesive stories (but that doesn't mean decades either)." Counterpoint: Take-Two CEO says AI is "going to be really, really bad" at making video games and probably couldn't even come up with the GTA 6 marketing plan Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more After earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We've been hearing that AI is coming for our jobs for years. Is it finally happening now? Maybe. We're now seeing a slew of big companies ditching thousands of jobs, citing AI as an animating rationale. This week, for instance, Amazon said it was cutting 14,000 white-collar jobs, arguing that it can and should be leaner in an AI age. In July, Microsoft said the same when it got rid of 9,000 jobs. IBM says it has replaced hundreds of workers with AI. And all of that may certainly be true. On the other hand: Again. I don't doubt that AI is being used in various ways, across multiple industries, and that those uses will grow. (I now routinely use ChatGPT to help me research and structure stories like the one you're reading now. While we're here: Axel Springer, the company that owns Business Insider, has a partnership with OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT.) And it would make plenty of sense for a company that thinks it's going to replace workers with software to move to do that in advance, instead of getting around to it after the fact. But inevitability is different from reality. I've been through enough layoff waves to know that rationales change … all the time. Chances are you know this, too.

By Nellie Andreeva Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV Jill Arthur, EVP TV Development and Production, is among the executives leaving Fifth Season as part of the layoffs at the independent studio, which impacted 10% of its staff, Deadline has learned. Fifth Season has been looking for a new head of television following the fall 2024 departure of Joe Hipps. Arthur and fellow EVP Noah Greenshner have been the most senior television executives at the company in the interim, with Greenshner staying on as the search continues. Arthur joined Fifth Season in 2022. Before that, she was a Senior Development and Programming Executive at Amazon Studios where she worked across comedy and drama on projects including The Power, Expats, Hanna, With Love, The Wilds, The Tick, Red Oaks, Catastrophe and Forever. She previously worked at Jerry Weintraub Productions, including early development of Westworld for HBO, and started her career as an agent at ICM. Watch on Deadline As Deadline exclusively reported Tuesday, Fifth Season has pink-slipped fewer than 20 staffers in its overall 160-employee count as part of the layoffs. The news of cuts comes in the wake of Chris Rice departing Fifth Season as co-CEO in September. His longtime partner, fellow co-CEO Graham Taylor, became Fifth Season’s sole CEO. Rice inked a first-look production deal with Fifth Season and remains an adviser to the company. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Title: US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as labour market weakens

Time Published: 2025-10-29T18:18:51Z

On Wednesday, the US central bank announced its second rate cut of the year. By Andy Hirschfeld Share Save The United States Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75-4.00 percent, amid signs of a slowing labour market and continued pressure on consumer prices. The cut, announced on Wednesday, marks the US central bank’s second rate cut this year. “Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” the Fed said in a statement. “Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated.” The cuts were largely in line with expectations. Earlier on Wednesday, CME FedWatch — which tracks the likelihood of rate cuts — said there was a 97.8 percent probability of rate cuts. After the September cut, economists had largely been expecting two additional rate cuts for the rest of this year. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley, among others, forecast one more 25-basis-point reduction by year’s end following Wednesday’s cut. Bank of America Global Research is the only major firm that is not anticipating another 25-basis-point cut in 2025. “The Fed has a challenging line to walk; lower interest rates to support labour markets and growth, or raise them to tamp down inflation. For now, they are taking a cautious approach tilted a bit towards the growth concerns,” Michael Klein, professor of international economic affairs at The Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told Al Jazeera. Despite forecasts, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said another rate cut isn’t necessarily inevitable. “We haven’t made a decision about December,” Powell told reporters in a press conference, referring to the next rate decision meeting of the Fed. “We remain well-positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.” The cuts come as economic data becomes increasingly scarce amid the ongoing government shutdown, now in its 29th day as of Wednesday, making it the second-longest in US history, behind the 35-day shutdown during the first presidency of Donald Trump in late 2018 and early 2019. Because of the shutdown, the Department of Labor did not release the September jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3. The only major government economic data released this month was the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the cost of goods and services and is a key measure of inflation. The CPI rose 0.3 percent in September on a month-over-month basis to an inflation rate of 3 percent. That data was released because the Social Security Administration required it to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for 2026. As a result, Social Security beneficiaries will receive a 2.8 percent increase in payments compared to 2025. The shutdown, however, could have a bigger impact on next month’s central bank decision as the Labor Department is currently unable to compile the data needed for its November reports. However, amid the limited government data, private trackers are showing a slowdown. “We are not going to be able to have the detailed feel of things, but I think if there were a significant or material change in the economy one way or another, I think we would pick that up,” Powell said. Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low, according to The Conference Board’s report that was released on Tuesday. The data showed that lower-income earners – those making less than $75,000 a year – are less confident about the economy as fears of job scarcity loom. This comes only days after several large corporations announced waves of layoffs. On Wednesday, Paramount cut 2,000 people from its workforce. On Tuesday, Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs. Last week, big box retailer Target cut 1,800 jobs. This comes as furloughs and layoffs weigh on government workers. The US government is the nation’s largest employer. Those making more than $200,000 annually remain fairly confident and are leading consumer spending that is keeping the economy afloat, according to The Conference Board. Pressures both on consumer spending and the labour market are largely driven by tariffs weighing on consumers and businesses. US markets are lower on the rate cut. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down by about 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq is about even with the market open as of 3pm in New York (19:00 GMT). Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Federal Reserve Cuts Key Rate As Government Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year as it seeks to shore up economic growth and hiring, even as inflation stays elevated. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell also cautioned that further rate cuts weren’t guaranteed, citing the government shutdown’s interruption of economic reports and sharp divisions among 19 Fed officials who participate in the central bank’s interest-rate deliberations. Speaking to reporters after the Fed announced its rate decision, Powell said there were “strongly differing views about how to proceed in December” at its next meeting and a further reduction in the benchmark rate is not “a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The rate cut — a quarter of a point — brings the Fed’s key rate down to about 3.9%, from about 4.1%. The central bank had cranked its rate to roughly 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 to combat the biggest inflation spike in four decades before implementing three cuts last year. Lower rates could, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as for business loans. The move comes amid a fraught time for the central bank, with hiring sluggish and yet inflation stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Compounding its challenges, the central bank is navigating without the economic signposts it typically relies on from the government, including monthly reports on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which have been suspended because of the government shutdown. Federal Reserve issues #FOMC statement: https://t.co/PN2waoTZrP Financial markets largely expected another rate reduction in December, and stock prices dropped after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 nearly unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing slightly lower. “Powell poured cold water on the idea that the Fed was on autopilot for a December cut,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. “Instead, they’ll have to wait for economic data to confirm that a rate cut is actually needed.” Powell was asked about the impact of the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 and has interrupted the distribution of economic data. Powell said the Fed does have access to some data that give it “a picture of what’s going on.” He added that, “If there were a significant or material change in the economy, one way or another, I think we’d pick that up through this.” But the Fed chair did acknowledge that the limited data could cause officials to proceed more cautiously heading into its next meeting in mid-December. “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving (on rates). I’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possibility that you would say ‘we really can’t see, so let’s slow down.’” The Fed typically raises its short term rate to combat inflation, while it cuts rates to encourage borrowing and spending and shore up hiring. Right now it sees risks of both slowing hiring and rising inflation, so it is reducing borrowing costs to support the job market, while still keeping rates high enough to avoid stimulating the economy so much that it worsens inflation. Yet Powell suggested the Fed increasingly sees inflation as less of a threat. He noted that excluding the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, inflation is “not so far from our 2% goal.” Inflation has slowed in apartment rents and for many services, such as car insurance. A report released last week showed that inflation remains elevated but isn’t accelerating. The government recalled employees to produce the report, despite the shutdown, because it was used to calculate the cost of living adjustment for Social Security. At the same time, the economy could be rebounding from a sluggish first half, which could improve job growth in the coming months, Powell said. That would make rate cuts less necessary. “For some part of the committee, it’s time to maybe take a step back and see if whether there really are downside risks to the labor market,” Powell said. “Or see whether in fact that the stronger growth that we’re seeing is real.” Two of the 12 officials who vote on the Fed’s rate decisions dissented Wednesday, but in different directions. Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against the move because he preferred no change to the Fed’s rate. Schmid has previously expressed concern that inflation remains too high. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented for the second straight meeting in favor of a half-point cut. Miran was appointed by President Donald Trump just before the central bank’s last meeting in September. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not reducing borrowing costs more quickly. In South Korea early Wednesday he repeated his criticisms of the Fed chair. “He’s out of there in another couple of months,” Trump said. Powell’s term ends in May. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the administration is considering five people to replace Powell, and will decide by the end of this year. The Fed also said Wednesday that it would stop reducing the size of its massive securities holdings, which it accumulated during the pandemic and after the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The change, to take effect Dec. 1, could over time slightly reduce longer-term interest rates on things like mortgages but won’t have much overall impact on consumer borrowing costs. Without government data, the economy is harder to track, Powell said. September’s jobs report, scheduled to be released three weeks ago, is still postponed. This month’s hiring figures, to be released Nov. 7, will likely be delayed and may be less comprehensive when finally released. And the White House said last week that October’s inflation report may never be issued at all. Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months, according to the Labor Department’s data. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The government shutdown puts millions at risk of losing food assistance — and Trump and lawmakers are MIA.

Title: What To Know About President Trump’s Cognitive Test

ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at President Trump’s cognitive test, Nvidia’s collaborations in life sciences and drug development, Cobot’s hospital robots, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. President Trump told reporters Monday that he had aced a cognitive test, comparing himself favorably to two younger Democrats, both of whom are non-white women. “The first couple of questions are easy. A tiger, an elephant, a giraffe, you know. When you get up to about five or six, and then when you get up to 10 and 20 and 25, they couldn’t come close to answering any of those questions,” he said. Trump, 79, appeared to be referring to a 10-minute test known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, commonly used to detect mild cognitive decline and early signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. These tests are not given routinely in the general public, but are typically administered to adults who may be experiencing memory problems or to those whose family members are concerned about them. Donald Trump’s father, Fred Trump, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, which has a genetic component. In his comments this week, Trump also said that he underwent an MRI, claiming that “it was perfect,” but did not identify the reason for it or whether it was related to the cognitive test. Brain MRIs can be used to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and to track their progression, but Trump did not give details about the MRI and there are numerous other body parts that could be scanned and reasons that they’re done. The White House did not respond to questions about the MRI or cognitive exam. This isn’t the first time that Trump has bragged about acing a cognitive test. Back in 2020, Trump notably went on television to talk about how he remembered a group of five words – Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV – in the right order. The appearance spawned memes and swag emblazoned with the five words. For decades, there has been discussion both within the White House medical team and the broader medical community about how presidents should be evaluated for office, cognitively as well as physically, former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman wrote in a New York Times op-ed last year. “While nearly all physical difficulties can be accommodated, cognitive impairments are a different issue,” Kuhlman wrote. “A president must be in top mental shape to evaluate a complex situation, form a plan, consider the alternatives and possible consequences to a decision, and then provide definitive directives in a timely manner.” Tech giant Nvidia, which became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market cap today, announced a series of partnerships this week with healthcare companies to use AI for drug development and in the life sciences. One major development: pharma giant Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the two are calling an “AI factory.” This supercomputer, built on more than 1,000 of Nvidia’s chips, will operate out of Lilly’s existing data center in Indianapolis. This machine will build new AI drug discovery models based on Lilly’s proprietary data and will also be tasked with automating manufacturing and optimizing clinical trials. Other collaborations include ones with Alphabet subsidiary Verily, which will integrate Nvidia’s AI tech into its precision health platform Pre; with Johnson & Johnson, which will use Nvidia's AI models to help train its surgical robots; and with Innovaccer, which is partnering with the tech giant to accelerate development of multimodal AI models for healthcare. Nvidia is also increasing its work with academic partners to use AI to advance life sciences research, including with more open source research models. These include CodonFM, used to develop RNA medicines; La-Proteina, which generates 3D protein structures; and a trio of models used for medical imaging. It also expanded its collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to develop virtual cell models that can be used by the scientific community. Novartis agreed to buy Avidity Biosciences for $12 billion to get its dystrophy drugs, now in late-stage trials. The deal is the second-largest biotech acquisition of the year, behind only J&J’s $14.6 billion purchase of central- nervous system drugmaker Intra-Cellular Therapies in January. Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan justified the price on an investor call Monday, saying that if the firm had waited for data, the size of the deal could have been “potentially twice as big.” Also: London-based GHO Capital raised $2.9 billion for a new healthcare fund focused on biopharma, medtech, life sciences tools and other areas of healthcare. The new capital brings GHO’s assets to some $10.5 billion, which it says makes it Europe’s largest healthcare-focused private equity firm. Plus: BridgeBio reported success in a second late-stage study for its therapy for a rare endocrine disorder and the FDA approved expanding the label for Merck’s potential blockbuster Winrevair to include its ability to reduce patients' risk of hospitalization and death from pulmonary arterial hypertension. AI pharma company Recursion received its second milestone payment of $30 million from partners Roche and Genentech for developing a whole-genome map of microglial immune cells. These are resident in the central nervous system, and the hope is that this information will provide new potential drug targets for a wide range of neurological disorders. The payment is part of a deal, worth up to $12 billion, that Recursion struck with the two drug companies in 2021. Plus: Curve Biosciences, which is building a digital “atlas” of the human body based on its collection of tissues from multiple organs and disease states, raised $40 million in funding led by life sciences investor Luma Group to commercialize its software to enable diagnosis and monitoring of chronic diseases. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company was valued at $35 million last year, according to PitchBook; it declined to disclose its current valuation. Brad Porter, who helped Amazon deploy an army of more than 500,000 warehouse robots, founded Collaborative Robots, or Cobot, three and half years ago to push more robots out into the world. One early customer (and investor): Mayo Clinic. Moving stuff at hospitals is an ordeal that takes lots of time and manpower, and the fast-paced environment of a hospital can lead to clogged hallways and delayed surgeries. “There’s a lot of material movement in hospitals and it’s done 24/7, and hospitals struggle to find enough staffing to do all of it,” Porter told Forbes. To start, he said, Cobot’s robots can move linen carts and food carts, and get surgical tools to the sterilization room and back. The Santa Clara, California-based company, which has raised $140 million from investors that include Sequoia, Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst, as well as Mayo Clinic, doesn’t just focus on hospitals. It has also worked with shipping giant Maersk, vaccine maker Moderna and healthcare logistics firm Owens & Minor. This is the unsexy side of robots, but the potential impact on hospitals, where profit margins are tight, could be game changing. “If you are a surgeon and you know you have a back-to-back schedule all day, and the surgical tools don’t make it from sterilization in time, your procedure is set back 15 minutes. On a human level, that causes a little anxiety and adrenaline,” Porter said. “If we can make it very smooth, then everything gets done very efficiently. That’s one of the lessons that we learned at Amazon.” Plus: Surgeons removed a genetically modified pig kidney from a patient nine months transplant. That’s the longest time such a kidney has lasted in a human patient. (Forbes spoke with the CEO of biotech startup eGenesis, which provided the kidney, last year about its technology and plans.) The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which helps determine vaccine policy, was hit by widespread layoffs at the agency, according to The Guardian. The working groups that analyze data and help draw up ACIP’s agendas have reportedly not met for months, and a scheduled October meeting has been indefinitely postponed due to the government shutdown. If the federal government does not make key vaccine recommendations for children next year, families may not be reimbursed by insurance companies or qualify for social programs. Plus: Texas sues Tylenol maker Kenvue alleging it deceived mothers about the risks associated with autism. The suit follows official warnings by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that acetaminophen is a potential cause for autism. Scientific research to date does not suggest a causal link. UnitedHealthcare may lose two-thirds of Obamacare enrollees after double-digit price hikes caused by Congress failing to extend premium subsidies. These subsidies are at the heart of the dispute over the current government shutdown. More than one-third of Eli Lilly’s new prescriptions for its weight-loss drug Zepbound are coming from its direct-to-consumer program, LillyDirect. Diptheria, a deadly disease for children, is resurgent in Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Chad. HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy, Jr. is directing the CDC to investigate health harms of offshore wind farms, despite no indication any exist. AI models are able to diagnose certain kinds of brain cancers faster and more cheaply than current molecular testing, according to a new study. Tom Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, pledged to give $253 million to six children’s hospitals around the country and form an alliance among them. Citing Donald Trump’s executive order on the “biological reality of sex,” the Veteran’s Administration will make it more difficult for male veterans to obtain coverage for breast cancer treatments, despite the fact that this cancer is typically more deadly for men than women. The FDA issued new draft guidance today proposing updates to the regulatory process for biosimilar drugs, aiming to accelerate their approval in order to reduce drug costs for patients.

New World will remain playable through 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon has ended development on New World, the company's big fantasy MMO. Season 10 is the last round of updates the game will receive, as some 14,000 jobs are impacted by layoffs across Amazon Games. As you might imagine, many of the large-scale action-RPG's players are feeling a mixture of emotions at this announcement, anger and sadness being two major ones. Some of them have poured hours into Aeternum, making friends and forging deep bonds through the game. One such player, who clocked an incredible 13,000 hours exploring, foraging and battling in the rich, fantastical landscape, wrote an impassioned Reddit post expressing their sorrow. "I can't even find the motivation to play. I think what's going on is unbelievably sad. And I'm feeling more than a little morose," they state. Coming less than a month after the Nighthaven expansion makes this "extra hard to take," as they lament what seemed like real hope for the project’s future. "New World was back. The game was alive," they say, before thanking everyone involved, especially the players: "The game is nothing without us." Their sentiment is shared in the Steam reviews, which are dragging New World's standing on Valve’s store into the gutter. "Amazon just stabbed it in the back," writes one New World-er who managed 100 hours over the course of a month. "Shame on you Amazon," says another. "Never trust Amazon Games," a third reviewer adds, and on and on. Lots of people are feeling a little betrayed by the decision, sudden as it seems, since there appeared to be more genuine investment going into making this a long-term release. New World’s servers will remain active through 2026, and there'll be at least six months for any decisions made otherwise, according to the announcement blog post. Sadly, this doesn't appear to make it any less painful.

Title: Why insurer Nationwide is investing $1.5 billion through 2028 on AI and other tech initiatives

Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Almost half of Nationwide’s 22,000 employees are using Microsoft Copilot and other artificial intelligence tools every day. The insurer’s wants that number to hit 90% by 2026. To make this lofty target a reality, the property and casualty insurance company on Wednesday announced it would invest $1.5 billion through 2028 to support technology innovation initiatives, including $100 million that will be earmarked to advance AI each year for the next three years. The AI spending will go toward creating and managing AI assistants that will take on more work tasks, training and education, software development, and the underlying infrastructure to ensure that the AI systems that Nationwide relies on are resilient and secure. Jim Fowler, Nationwide’s chief technology officer, says that the new financial commitment represents a 20% increase from what the company has been spending on an annual basis “in the last couple of years.” Since 2015, Nationwide says that it has invested $5 billion in technology modernization. It is also indicative of a strategic pivot of Nationwide’s AI Playbook. Four months ago, Fowler says the company’s leadership met and wasn’t pleased to see dozens of AI use cases had proliferated across the organization. While workers were getting more efficient, it wasn’t always clear how they should use their extra time. Ten of Nationwide’s C-suite leaders worked collaboratively to identify 18 flagship AI use cases to prioritize across the business. “We stepped back and we said, ‘We’ve got to get out of experimentation mode,’” says Fowler. A few of the flagship AI use cases that Nationwide will be focusing on include a tool that will automate 80% of pets claims, including the resolution of 25% of those claims with an instant settlement. Fowler says this application of AI will create more capacity for the operations team to hunt down new business. For the farm and agricultural insurance business, AI tools are expected to reduce the review time for those claims by 20%. In recent months, CTOs and chief information officers have pivoted their investment strategies to focus on fewer bets tied to bigger business outcomes. This new approach could help them finally achieve a steadier return on their AI investments, which has proven to be difficult to achieve as enterprises near the three-year mark since the debut of ChatGPT. “Part of what we’re doing differently, that I see other companies doing, is we’re setting targets that are the ROI,” says Fowler. “And those targets are big enough that even if we don’t get to the full target, we will still be wildly happy with the outcome.” That includes an efficiency target for Fowler’s own software employees. His goal is to use more AI coding assistant tools to cut the cycle time to write new software by 50%. “I’ve got no shortage in the backlog of demand for technology,” says Fowler, especially given this week’s big new IT investment. Nationwide, which ranks 72 on the Fortune 500, says it has already scaled six AI initiatives. Those tools include a generative AI claims assistant that can summarize the log notes of complex customer claims. When a claims representative gets in touch with a customer to discuss a large reported loss, it gets a one-paragraph summary to bring them up to speed on the case. An AI-enabled tool is also being used by developers to help migrate legacy code to new platforms. Fowler says that this tool has driven a 50% reduction in code conversion time for Nationwide’s development teams. That solution was developed during one of Nationwide’s hackathon events. Already, AI chatbots and other productivity tools have been embraced by some early AI adopters. Nationwide says it has identified around 1,000 employees who had made themselves more productive using AI. While the company wants to continue to encourage that usage, Nationwide also wants to focus more energy and dollars on the flagship ideas. “What we saw is that with all the experimentation that was going on over the last two-and-a-half years, nothing was scaling,” says Fowler. “I don’t want to take away from the associates the ability to kind of drive their own local productivity, but I want to be more intentional about where we’re going to get scale for bigger solutions.” Next week, Fowler says that Nationwide will host a symposium for roughly 1,000 employees who have an associate vice president title or above. The company will tap the expertise of both internal and external speakers to talk through expectations for how technology, including AI, will improve operations and the future strategy for every business unit. These bigger bets on AI from have raised questions about the future of work and surveys have shown workers are worried that they’ll be displaced by the technology. Just this week, Amazon announced it will cut about 14,000 jobs as it accelerates spending on AI. But AI may not necessarily be a job killer at Nationwide. Fowler says that the company’s sales have grown 50% over the last five years and “we’re really not expecting that to slow down.” His hope is that AI and other innovative technologies will make it easier to generate more business. “This isn’t just an efficiency play,” explains Fowler. “AI is not just about productivity.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Amazon to cut 14,000 corporate jobs amid AI push. Mere months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that efficiency gains from AI would mean fewer jobs, the tech giant announced a fresh round of layoffs that will reportedly span various departments including logistics, payments, video games, and the company’s cloud computing business. Reuters on Monday had reported that the layoff total could actually affect as many as 30,000, but Amazon says that will increase hiring for some parts of the business and the 14,000 figure represents an overall workforce reduction. The newly planned cuts would surpass the total of the company’s rolling reductions in 2022 and 2023 that led to more than 27,000 corporate job eliminations, as Amazon and other tech giants angled to slim their workforce after a pandemic-era boom in hiring. Global IT spending is projected to hit a record in 2026. As CIOs are busy preparing their 2026 budgets, it looks like many of these technologies will have a lot more money to invest in generative AI and other technologies, as research firm Gartner projects that global IT spending will surpass $6 trillion. It would be a record amount and indicates a big 9.8% increase in spending from this year, growth that is driven by investments in data center systems and software, both categories that reflect the increased demand for AI. “The cost of software is going up and both the cost of features and functionality is going up as well thanks to gen AI,” said John-David Lovelock, an analyst for Gartner. Gartner also projects that shipments for mobile phones and PCs would be strong next year, but at a slower pace than in 2025. Alaska Airlines to review IT systems after recent outages. After an IT outage grounded hundreds of flights late last week and caused four days of flight disruptions this summer due to a hardware failure, the airline says it will bring in external experts to review its IT infrastructure. “We are immediately bringing in outside technical experts to diagnose our entire IT infrastructure to ensure we are as resilient as we need to be,” the company said in a statement shared with the Anchorage Daily News. An airline analyst at Raymond James has warned that the IT outage that canceled about 400 flights could cost Alaska Airlines $26 million. Those losses will be included in the company’s fourth-quarter results. McKinsey warns bank profits could take a massive hit if they don’t adapt to AI. The consulting giant has issued a stark report that warns that AI could erode the banking industry’s profitability by $170 billion, or 9%, over the course of the next decade, as consumers will embrace AI agents instead of humans to handle some of their financial services needs. Bloomberg notes that while the banking sector is set to generate cost savings between 15% to 20% from investments in AI, McKinsey has warned that competition from AI will likely erode those gains and that most of the benefits will be accrued by customers. Leaders are bullish on the ROI for agentic AI despite tech being in early stages of deployment. While some recent studies have poured cold water on the promised ROI of AI, an agentic AI-focused survey published Wednesday from data intelligence company Collibra and The Harris Poll took a far more bullish stance. 86% of respondents say they were “confident” that agentic AI will drive ROI for their total organization, with similar proportions confident that their investments in the technology will spur innovation (85%) and governance (84%). The survey polled more than 300 data management, privacy, and AI decision makers from U.S.-based companies. Nine out of ten technology leaders say their organization is currently developing or rolling out agentic AI, though most remain in the very early stages of developing this more autonomous form of the technology. When asked about implementation methods, a clear majority are relying on vendors or third-party partnerships (58%), while 49% are building their own agentic systems internally. Collibra CEO and founder Felix Van de Maele tells Fortune that many enterprises will build their AI agents on top of platforms offered by Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, and others, but that this approach will come with challenges related to tracking an explosion in the number of agents that will be deployed, data reliability, and securely monitoring what actions they are authorized to take. “If something goes wrong, the impact is much bigger,” says Van de Maele. “The stakes are higher and so the governance of that is going to be important.” Courtesy of Collibra Hiring: - USPTO is seeking a CIO, based in Alexandria, Virginia.

Title: One chart shows how Amazon's layoffs are a drop in the bucket after its pandemic-era hiring spree

The 14,000 corporate workers being let go are about 0.9% of its roughly 1.6 million employees as of the end of last year. The Big Tech company expanded to over a million full-time and part-time employees in 2020, climbing to 1.6 million a year later when there was a lot of turnover in the overall US workforce as the economy reopened after the pandemic-induced recession. Amazon's workforce has roughly tripled between 2017 and 2024. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a message to workers on Tuesday that the new cuts "are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs." Amazon is just one large company that's laying off workers. UPS said in its third-quarter earnings that it has cut thousands of roles in the first nine months of the year. Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, told Business Insider that AI is a plausible factor in the current spate of layoffs. However, he added that the elevated hiring a few years ago is likely the larger reason. "I see this as mainly a correction to pandemic-era dynamics rather than some new thing like AI that's striking these companies," Tedeschi said. During the Great Resignation and the hot labor market following the big post-COVID reopening, workers felt empowered to move around a lot. That also meant companies opening up roles and seeking new hires. Tedeschi said companies were able to maintain their beefed-up workforce for a while, but can't continue to do so in a more uncertain period. "The other shoe is dropping, and they have to cost optimize and let some of those people go," Tedeschi said. Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, told Business Insider that the US is in a low-hire, low-fire job market, following a high-hire market with high quits just a few years ago. "We've just had some pretty dramatic changes in the labor market in recent years," Sahm said. Some of the laid-off Amazon workers could end up finding a new role at the company. Galetti said in the Tuesday message that the company is "offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Jump to

Title: Wall Street zeroes in on AWS and AI investments ahead of Amazon's Q3 earnings report

Amazon's stock popped more than 13% on Thursday afternoon after the company reported huge growth in the third quarter, including in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. CEO Andy Jassy said AWS was "growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022." He also called out particularly strong demand for its AI offerings. "We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure," Jassy said. The company's results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, offering investors a sigh of relief, particularly as Amazon's stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven this year. "This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end," Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon. The earnings report came after Amazon earlier this week said it would be cutting 14,000 jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in its history. Jassy told analysts on Thursday's earnings call that the layoffs were "not financially driven" and were instead about making the company faster after years of head count growth. Amazon's stock is up 13% in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call ends. AI agents could become a big part of how people shop online, but there's still room for improvement, Jassy said. Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said. AI agents could become a big part of how people shop online, but there's still room for improvement, Jassy said. Many shopping agents don't have access to shoppers' purchase history, limiting how good their suggestions are. They also often mess up basic information, such as an item's price, he said. That will likely change, though. "I do think that we will find ways to partner" with AI shopping tools, he said. Jassy said that Tuesday's layoffs were "not financially driven." Instead, he said, it's about culture. Amazon grew its head count over the past few years, which "can weaken the ownership" of Amazon employees who "are doing the actual work" and slow down key decisions, Jassy said. He added that Amazon wants a flat, fast organization. Jassy said Whole Foods is growing faster than most grocery chains. He also told analysts to expect more locations for Whole Foods Daily Shop, the chain's latest small-format grocery. Amazon is "most excited about" the ability to deliver perishable groceries for same-day delivery. Jassy added that the ability to order fresh foods multiple times a week for delivery, like Amazon provides, is part of the reason more customers are avoiding a weekly stock-up. Jassy said that Amazon will always offer customers multiple chip options, including those from rivals like Nvidia. At the same time, he said, Amazon's in-house chips make it different from other tech players. Amazon's Trainium chips, including its Trainium 3, will offer customers better value, especially as they try to use AI more broadly, he said. The first question asked how capacity-constrained AWS is right now. Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027. The first question asked how capacity-constrained AWS is right now. Jassy said that Amazon increased capacity during the quarter. The company plans to double its capacity by the end of 2027. There's also lots of interest from customers in Amazon's Trainium chip, Jassy said. Amazon expects capital expenditures of about $125 billion for 2025, CFO Olsavsky said. That's above the $118.76 billion that analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting. That will increase in 2026, he adds.

That will increase in 2026, he adds. For the third quarter, Amazon's capex was $34.2 billion. Jassy highlighted the fourth quarter as a key one for Amazon, with the holiday shopping season and AWS's re:Invent conference scheduled for December, before handing the call over to CFO Brian Olsavsky. Jassy said that Amazon sees opportunities to grow advertising around Prime Video, adding that live sports have gotten a lot of interest from advertisers. For the third quarter, advertising services net sales rose 24% to $17.7 billion. Jassy said Rufus had 250 million active users this year, and that customers using Rufus during a shopping trip were 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Amazon is on track to beat its delivery speed record again this year for Prime members, Jassy said. Jassy said a new option that lets customers add items to orders they've already scheduled has been used 80 million times. Jassy highlighted how some Amazon agentic coding tools have saved time and money for its clients. Kiro, for example, attracted about 100,000 developers in an initial preview, and the number of users is now more than double that. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy kicked off the call by talking about AWS, teasing unannounced deals worth more than all new deals in its third quarter. He also briefly mentioned that Amazon's competitors have smaller annual revenue than AWS does. CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are kicking it off with prepared remarks. Shares of Amazon are 11% higher in after-hours trading as the company's earnings call is about to begin. Amazon grew the number of rural communities that had access to same-day and next-day delivery by 60% over the past four months, it said in its earnings release. The e-commerce giant is increasingly competing with Walmart and Dollar General as it offers faster delivery in small towns and other sparsely populated parts of the US. Amazon's earnings show that the company is "firing on all cylinders after a year of relative underperformance," Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said on Thursday afternoon. The results are also a good sign for Amazon's standing in relation to the other Big Tech stocks, Feller said.

"Despite lagging the Magnificent Seven and the broader market for much of 2025, the company's fundamentals never meaningfully weakened," Feller wrote. "This banner quarter could mark a turning point for investor sentiment and set the stage for Amazon to reclaim a leadership role among large-cap tech stocks heading into year-end." Amazon's third-quarter results show the company is making progress in adding AI to its operations, Investing.com's senior analyst Jesse Cohen said. "Although AWS sales fell slightly short of projections, the division still achieved its fastest growth pace since 2022, underscoring the robust demand for cloud services," Cohen wrote.

He added: "As AI continues to play a pivotal role in Amazon's trajectory, the company is well-positioned for continued innovation and expansion." Amazon shares were up more than 9% after the company reported its earnings Thursday afternoon. One factor could be CEO Andy Jassy's comments on AWS. Amazon shares were up more than 9% after the company reported its earnings Thursday afternoon. One factor could be CEO Andy Jassy's comments on AWS. "AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY," Jassy said in Amazon's earnings release. "We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months." Amazon's third quarter included two big one-time charges. The first is $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs "primarily related to planned role eliminations." The other was its previously announced $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over its Prime membership program. Third quarter results: Fourth quarter guidance: Third quarter results: Fourth quarter guidance: Source: Bloomberg and company filings Amazon's Prime Day event in October has become an early chance for shoppers to score holiday deals, and other retailers have even debuted their own versions. On Thursday's call, Amazon could provide an early glimpse into how holiday shopping is shaping up. Expect Amazon to play a big role once the holiday shopping season starts in earnest. About 73% of shoppers surveyed by marketing platform Omnisend said that Amazon is their go-to source for deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon's ad business has been finding potential growth opportunities lately. A recent deal with Netflix will let brands buy ad slots on the streamer through Amazon's own demand-side platform. The move rattled shares of adtech rival The Trade Desk after it was announced. Amazon is expected to give a capital expenditures update on its earnings call this afternoon. Last quarter, Amazon's capex totaled $31.4 billion, and the company said the figure was "reasonably representative" of its quarterly capex rate for the rest of the year. It's largely driven by investments in AWS — particularly AI and tech infrastructure — and Amazon's fulfillment and transportation network. Capex growth is a hot-button issue across Big Tech. The following chart shows how spending stacks up so far. Investors will be listening for any details that CEO Andy Jassy and the company offer about Amazon's grocery business in light of a recent reboot. In June, a memo obtained by Business Insider showed that Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go were being united under a single "One Grocery" operation eight years after Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

Wedbush has high hopes for the tech giant heading into the call, maintaining a $280 price target, up from its previous target of $250 a share. The firm's analysts predict that it is poised for a breakout in 2026 and likely to shake off the volatility that has weighed on the stock recently. They expect Amazon to reach $99.6 billion in full-year revenue, and predict Q3 revenue of $20.1 billion.

Amazon said on Tuesday that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs in one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history.

AWS also hired a new vice president of security services and observability this month, a sign that the unit is trying to improve security around its AI products. JPMorgan analysts said that while they believe Amazon has done a good job executing on retail sales and margin expansion, they're worried about its positioning in the booming generative AI space. "There is concern around AMZN's GenAI positioning/strategy, relative gap to Azure/Google Cloud growth, & trajectory of 2H AWS growth pick-up," they said.

New World season 10 is the game's last major update When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After a little over four years of updates, Amazon is throwing in the towel on New World. The recently launched season 10 of the ambitious fantasy MMO will be its last, and among those providing commiserations is a former World of Warcraft dev who's very aware of the current struggles. Greg Street, who served as lead systems designer on World of Warcraft for several years, posted a simple tribute on Twitter to the team behind New World. "I'm sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream alive," he stated. A longtime designer who’s been in the industry for over 20 years, Street is currently attempting to put out an MMORPG himself, through Fantastic Pixel Castle, for which he serves as studio head and game director. Started in 2023, the outfit has been working on a fantasy multiplayer game for some time, though earlier this month, Street revealed they were having trouble finding a publisher after a deal with NetEase fell through. I’m sorry for my friends at Amazon who were trying to keep the MMO dream aliveOctober 29, 2025 When asked about the climate of triple-A development, where we've seen numerous layoffs and canceled projects over the last couple of years, Street mentions it's possible with the right management. "I think it's sustainable with realistic budgets and timeframes. But indies are having a great moment right now," he says. Amazon cited sustainability issues in its decision to pause the rollout of additional features for New World, and the decision comes amid layoffs affecting 14,000 employees across its video game operations. Getting an MMORPG off the ground and keeping it alive are two distinct struggles, and in a world where there are already so many live-service games vying for people's time, carving out space for New World can't have been easy. The game will remain playable through 2026, per official messaging, and a minimum of six months' notice is promised before anything happens that impacts access.

Title: Trump may finally get what he wants from Fed chair. But the economy is still wobbly.

MSNBC TV More Shows President Donald Trump received a long-awaited gift from America’s central bank today: lower interest rates for the second consecutive month. The news was delivered by one of the public officials he has most villainized throughout the course of both of his presidencies: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017. Trump lambasted Powell this week, calling him “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell” in a speech to Asian business leaders in South Korea. “We’re not going to have a Fed that’s going to raise interest rates because they’re worried about inflation in three years from now,” Trump added. It’s unclear if Trump’s rhetoric about Powell will change now that the Fed has shifted course from leaving rates unchanged. On Tuesday, the central bank’s governors voted to lower rates by 25 basis points. “The Federal Reserve’s much-needed interest rate cut only highlights how destructive the Democrat Government Shutdown is — with key government economic data releases delayed potentially indefinitely, the Federal Reserve is flying blind heading into its next meeting in December. As are the businesses, families, investors, and markets who rely on reliable and timely government data,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. Trump has frequently taken aim at the Federal Reserve chief for holding steady on interest rates as inflation continues to dog the economy — threatening to fire him and then backing off. He is actively seeking a new Fed chair to appoint once Powell’s term as chairman expires in May, engaging in an unusually public search for a replacement. The personal animus continued during Trump’s swing this week through Asia. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday about Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” Trump lambasted the Federal Reserve chair this week, calling him “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell” in a speech to Asian business leaders in South Korea. The last time the Federal Reserve dropped its funds rate was in 2024, in a series of decisions that Trump has described — without evidence — as politically motivated, coming both before and after his election. Now that the president got his wish of lower borrowing costs, economists say it’s unlikely to deliver immediate relief. Although a key inflation reading turned out to be lower than expected last week, it was still above the Fed’s 2% target, coming in a full point higher at 3%. Enduring inflation has remained a thorny issue for Trump, running counter to his campaign vows to lower the cost of living for Americans while he is in office. A majority of Americans, 74%, say that economic conditions are only “fair” or “poor,” according to a recent survey from Pew Research Center, including more than half of Republicans and 90% of Democratic respondents. William Yu, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the Fed is responding to “a problem” in the economy, specifically weak labor and housing markets. Cutting the federal funds rate is the “right decision,” Yu said. The Labor Department has yet to release its official monthly jobs report due to the ongoing government shutdown in Washington, D.C., but forecasters say the downward trend of recent months is likely to continue. Multiple corporate giants, including Amazon, Target and United Parcel Service, announced massive layoffs this week. Meanwhile, Meta, the owner of Facebook, and Rivian, an electric-vehicle company, said they also cut about 600 jobs each. In August, unemployment rose to 4.3% for the first time since October 2021. Previously, data showing a strong job market and stubborn inflation kept interest rates near their highest levels in more than a decade. Typically, a downward adjustment is a sign that the board wants to encourage economic growth. “I don’t think it will change the trajectory of the economy all that much,” said Josh Bivens, chief economist at the progressive-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Cuts “will not be any kind of game changer in the near term.” Bivens, like other analysts interviewed by MSNBC, said he believes that the White House’s tariff policies are pushing prices higher. Five Senate Republicans on Tuesday voted to block Trump’s duty on Brazil in a rare rebuke of the president. Those levies, Biven said, are more likely to continue to drive costs going into next year, rather than the federal funds rate. Yu also expressed skepticism that interest range changes will have a sizable impact on inflation, though for different reasons, including increased costs for rent, insurance premiums and medical expenses. “That is totally different, totally unrelated to monetary policy,” he said. Still, the California-based professor sees bright spots, including positive expectations for gross domestic product in the third quarter. Tech companies have kept output high, generating trillions of dollars globally so far this year. However, “very few” sectors outside tech are growing, said Jai Kedia, who studies macroeconomics at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. The persistence of elevated prices has led to some debate about the Fed’s next move. “I understand that the Fed is worried about the labor market and is trying to lower rates to boost employment,” Kedia said, “but if you look at the trade-off between employment and inflation, I think the decision to cut rates is much harder than what most people seem to be making it out to be.” The central bank’s decision comes on the cusp of a meeting between Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping in South Korea. U.S. officials are optimistic that the two competitors will avoid another escalation in a roller-coaster trade war that has the potential to destabilize the global economy. Kedia pointed to “the highest tariff rates we’ve had in several decades” as the main culprit for his assessment of a “poor economic cycle.” Some companies are absorbing tariff costs, Yu noted, preventing consumers from taking the hit. “People expect that the Fed will change something and it’ll have drastic effects,” Kedia said, “but really, a 25 basis point interest rate cut isn’t going to change companies’ minds on whether they shouldn’t fire people or shouldn’t hire more.” The libertarian economist sees supply shocks as causing both unemployment and inflation to rise, and he said he believes more companies are passing along tariff costs to Americans. Nonetheless, a rate cut is precisely what Trump has lobbied for, including by floating the prospect of ousting Powell on several occasions. The Fed is considered an independent government agency, making the removal of a chair highly unusual and unprecedented. The president, as recently as Monday, mused about replacing Powell at the end of his term in May. “I think it’s the world’s easiest job, but to get it right, you have to be very smart, and we have a person that’s not at all smart right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. The president in September appointed his former chief economist Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve. Miran is the one governor whose recommendations largely depart from his fellow board members by calling for bigger rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs help homebuyers save money on purchasing, along with other consumer lenders, an important reason why the president has pushed for a change in Fed policy. Trump has called for dramatically bigger rate cuts. With several months remaining until Trump gets his pick for a new chair, he’s still taking jabs. "We’ll appoint somebody that we all like, because we should have the lowest interest rates of any country, because without us, there are no other countries, really," he said this week.

Title: WSJ: AI Contributes to White-Collar Jobs Disappearing in Corporate America

According to the Wall Street Journal, America’s largest employers are cutting white-collar positions at an alarming rate, leaving experienced and new workers struggling to find opportunities in a stagnant job market. AI plays a role in the elimination of some white-collar jobs, with some CEOs directly crediting the technology with reducing headcount. The Wall Street Journal reports that the landscape of white-collar employment in the United States is undergoing a dramatic shift as companies embrace AI and prioritize efficiency. Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been eliminated in recent months, with major players like Amazon, United Parcel Service, Target, Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton, and General Motors announcing significant layoffs. This trend is leaving both experienced professionals and new graduates with fewer options and increased competition for the remaining positions. Behind this wave of job cuts lies a combination of factors, including the adoption of AI technologies that can handle tasks previously performed by well-compensated white-collar workers, investor pressure to streamline operations, political uncertainty, and rising costs. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of remaining managers and employees are being redefined, with heavier workloads and less time for individual attention becoming the norm. In some cases, corporate leaders are bragging about AI replacing humans, such as Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Breitbart News previously reported that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned months ago that white-collar job cuts were coming due to AI: Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. The warning comes amidst growing excitement and concern about the potential of AI to disrupt the job market. Some industry leaders, such as Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, have predicted that unemployment could spike to 20 percent in the next few years due to the rapid development of AI technology. The impact of these layoffs on affected workers is profound. Many find themselves struggling to secure new employment in their fields, despite years of experience and qualifications. Some, like Chris Reed, a 33-year-old former tech sales professional, have been forced to take jobs outside their areas of expertise to support their families. Reed, who was laid off a year ago, applied to over 1,000 jobs before accepting a position selling cars, a decision that has taken a toll on his work-life balance and family relationships. As white-collar opportunities dwindle, the demand for front-line, blue-collar, and specialized workers is growing. Companies report shortages in trade, healthcare, hospitality, and construction roles, while simultaneously cutting positions in consulting, management, retail, and finance. This shift is further compounded by the increasing use of AI to perform tasks in accounting and fraud monitoring. The changing job market is also affecting entry-level hiring, with recent graduates facing heightened competition and fewer offers despite submitting more applications. Kobe Baker, a 23-year-old Baylor University graduate, struggled to find a foothold in the New York City job market before eventually accepting a customer service position. Many young people are finding it increasingly difficult to achieve independence due to the lack of available opportunities. Read more at the Wall Street Journal here.

Title: Amazon’s New World and Middle-earth Dreams Crumble into Dust as the Destruction of the Video Game Industry Continues

It is not every day when you get to witness a disregard for a cherished classic that also demonstrates hubris and a blind ignorance of MMO history, but occasionally you get interview like that. And it is less common to then get to see the whole thing blown up. I am referring to the GamesIndustry.biz interview with Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann of a couple years back in which he went on about the company’s plans for a Middle-earth MMO, blithely declaring that people would move to their title from LOTRO because it would be a better game and that you if wanted something that adhered to the books you should go read the books. Amazon was going to make a game first, and something to do with the Middle-earth lore second, seeming to devalue the impact the lore might have on the game and its appeal, something which might make one ask why they would bother licensing the IP if it was being a good game that mattered. At the time the idea was ascendant once more with Amazon because the Embracer Group had bought the Middle-earth IP and was looking to exploit it, no questions asked. Since then we had not heard much. Not until yesterday. Here they come again Yesterday Amazon announced that it was laying off 14,000 workers (and possibly as many as 30,000 ongoing) and is going to embrace AI more fully, two things no doubt aimed to boost the company’s stock price. There is nothing Wall Street loves more right now that unemployed tech workers and the fantasy that they can all be replaced by the hallucinating plagiarism machine that is AI. As part of that Amazon Game Studios was a direct target in the layoffs, with the locations in California, San Diego and Irvine, both reported to be hard hit. Neither location now exists as an option on Amazon’s hiring site, though that may only mean that there are no open positions. Still, reports are that Amazon’s shot at a game based on The Lord of the Rings has reached its end. We will never see if Amazon could make a better game that LOTRO, how loose and fast they would have been with the lore, and if LOTRO players would have migrated to the new title in any numbers. Their hubris will not be tested and LOTRO remains unchallenged. This also means the end of development for Amazon’s New World MMO, which struggled through a problematic launch which saw the company spending most of the game’s first year fixing problems and implanting standard industry features like a test server where players could go through new features and changes before they were pushed to production, the “test in production” methodology that the studio initially adopted being one of the key problems with the game in the early months. Amazon has pledged to keep the game going through 2026… but if you wanted to play it, I would suggest getting started sooner rather than later. This divestiture from video games isn’t hugely surprising. Amazon didn’t buy their way into video games due to any passion for the industry. Jeff Bezos isn’t a gamer. They did it because video games, as an industry, had a really good decade. Between 2011 and 2020 the line kept going up for the industry, peaking dramatically during Covid. And when the video game industry ended its golden run, a lot of companies started cutting back. Amazon has been particularly callous in its management of its so-called Amazon Game Studios. Cancellations and layoffs were already a regular thing. This is just “the big one,” the message that Amazon is no longer at all serious about video games. So Amazon is just following the current trajectory of implosion that the video game industry has been facing in the post-Covid downturn where we can no longer use the term “decimate” as that technically means “one in ten” and we’re probably past that. The drumbeat of layoffs continue to hit the industry, led by Microsoft and its regular culling off staff to help XBox head Phil Spencer keep his obscene annual bonus coming. Just last week Netflix purged its game development staff at Boss Fight Entertainment. And more is expected to come, especially with EA set to be torn asunder in the name of wealth extraction once Saudi Arabia grabs what they want from the company as part of their acquisition plan to whitewash their bloodthirsty regime by becoming an esports hub. Part of the EA plan is to fully embrace AI, a plan that companies like Krafton, makers of Subnautica and PUBG, are also adopting. AI means fewer staff in theory. We will see what pushing development tasks to AI means in practice. More money for AI companies for sure, and probably worse choices for consumers. As part of Amazon’s announcement, they also declared that they are going to go big on AI, and have not been at all shy about how it will replace jobs at the company. No layoffs yet at the AI game group, which recently launched Courtroom Chaos, a game in which an AI driven Snoop Dogg does his routine. Courtroom Chaos – Now the pinnacle of Amazon Game Studios This is something your mother would probably enjoy, a chance to laugh at a black man transgressing the norms of “polite society” or something. That is Snoop Dogg’s shtick for sure these days, and I am sure it pays well, but it isn’t a serious video game with any depth. It is an attempt to automate Cards Against Humanity. But you can try it for free on Amazon’s Luna platform if you are an Amazon Prime member. So what happens next? Amazon has resisted answering any questions about the once mighty Middle-earth title. They would like that all to just go away please. Embracer Group will have to find somebody else willing to pay for the rights to do whatever they want with the IP. Maybe Amazon can get Ian McKellen to voice a Courtroom Chaos as Gandalf? There were also a couple other unannounced titles Amazon was working on that are no doubt dust in the wind at this point. Then there is New World. That title is a dead man walking if ever there was one. We all know it. It is just a question of how much longer it will last. I am surprised, what with the super duper AWS architecture that the company bragged about, that they are going to pass up an opportunity to do something like rent 4 player New World servers to people. They are always hungry for some AWS revenue. But maybe their AWS model wasn’t as flexible as they suggested. And even if it was, that sort of move would require some prep work, and Amazon isn’t investing any more in big games. There are also another batch of game developers looking for their next job in an industry that has been shedding such positions for almost five years now. Amazon says all laid off staff will be able to apply for other jobs within Amazon, but that seems unlikely to pay off. There are certainly developer jobs outside of game development, if you want to work in a company that is trying to be the “worlds largest startup,” their words. That translates into small teams, long hours, unrealistic timelines, changing goals, and a constant anxiety about the safety of your position. I have known five people who went to word for Amazon. Four moved on in under six months, all in software developer roles. The fifth works at the Amazon warehouse seasonally to make a few bucks in retirement. Not exactly the career oriented model for most of us. Related: It’s curious that Amazon have declined either to make a statement or answer direct questions about the LotR game. They’ve been very happy to give chapter and verse on all the other MMOs they have running. It makes me think the fate of the in-development title isn’t finalized yet. Perhaps they plan to sell it on? Or even finish it. I have (Another) post about AI brewing, the gist of which is that a lot of people are in for a rude awakening. Probably on both sides of the love it or hate it divide. I bookmarked a couple of articles from gamesindustry, both of which have specific examples of companies that have used AI for the reducing staffing/speeding up production purpose it seems to be mainly being promoted these days. It did not go well for either of them. I have yet to read a report about any company that’s tried it for whom it proved more useful than where they were before. On the other hand, I read another piece at GI today, which made the excellent point that what AI might actually be useful for in game development is making new types of games that currently don’t exist, rather than making the same ones faster and cheaper. I think that might also be true, although if the result is a whole lot of Snoop Dogalikes I can’t say I’m thrilled by the prospect. Anyway, I’d better save that for the post. Shame about New World. I always liked it. LikeLike One of my current job tasks is to be part of a test team trying to us AI to build apps. These are pretty simple web based apps. We started with using some requirements I wrote for previous apps that were already built… and AI will go down every rabbit hole it finds. It has been a pretty graphic example of how AI doesn’t understand anything in the way a human does. Getting it to realize something is out of scope can be like arguing with a curious toddler. My current operating theory based on a couple months of this is that the best case scenario is that communication with AI will become another programming language of its own and that you will eat up as much time getting prompts exactly right as you would have with a competent developer just writing the code in whatever coding language you have chosen. I will have to check on that GI article about “new types” of games. I am pretty skeptical that AI can do anything new unless you plan to lead it by the hand. LikeLike It’s not a whole article. That was me being lazy. It’s a section of a report on the games/comics convention that was on in London recently. It was the bit towards the end with the YouTube video for an actual game that’s supposed to come out next year. It’s hardly original but it gives a hint of where AI games could go. LikeLike The devs that were let go verified the entire LOTR team was let go so no way they finish it. LikeLike I have a theory on the current games landscape. I think that between WoW and Minecraft and their multi billions, the industry has been in a bubble for the past 20 years or so. It feels like we are finally getting to the point where big companies see that the multi billion dollar games are rare enough not to bet on, so they are winding down their investment. There is still a good industry to be had among the medium sized and small/indie houses, but for the big non-dedicated companies (MS, Amazon), AI feels like a desperation move to make games the gold rush they used to be, but it won’t pan out and they will wind down further. It’s a contraction, but it will make the industry healthier in the long run to remove those only here for the bucks. LikeLike Absolutely provable via the data, video games started a run after the Dot Com bubble burst that ran through to the end of Covid, which helped it hit peaks we’ll not see again, with only the mortgage default crisis of 2008 to 2012 slowed down. There is an absolute ton of money sitting in low yield but very safe government bonds that is always looking for any safe bet for a better yield. This “giant pool of money” was what drove the mortgage default crisis, because mortgages were safe… but there were not enough of them relative to the potential investors, so brokers started issue no income/no asset verification mortgages. That money, which was over a trillion dollars back in 2008, is always looking for some better return and is what drives all the bubbles. VR, the metaverse, crypto, and now AI. That went into video games pretty big in the back half of the teens and went on a frenzy on seeing the Covid era numbers. And then we all went back outside. LikeLike WoW isn’t even really a big dollar game. It’s big to us as MMORPG fans, but its not anywhere near titles like CoD or the real kings: mobile game giants. In comparison; WoW is actually an expensive game to keep going. That’s the landscape shift in game development; hard complex games to develop and run live services for are losing out to simple mobile cash generator games. LikeLike WoW has crossed the billion dollar annual revenue line, or hovered near it, for most of its life. That sagged for a while, but was revived with WoW Classic. And I would argue that it is no more expensive to keep up than a live service game like the annual COD titles, which also cost a lot more to produce every year than a WoW expansion. That success continues to entice companies. Amazon didn’t throw itself into building two MMOs and publishing a few more, because MMOs are small potatoes and not worth the effort. Amazon just thought reproducing WoW numbers would be easy, like every company since 2005 or so. That said, WoW is an extreme outlier. Most MMOs are under $100 million in annual revenue. That is enough to support a small company that is careful with its resource and can be a nice thing to keep off the books. EA put its MMOs under Broadsword because it liked the revenue, but not the hit to margins so they made up another company so they could just claim the income. Shared world MMORPGs are a niche market. LikeLike If Amazon could use robots –both warehouse and flying– to package, ship, and deliver, they wouldn’t have more than 5-10 people in those warehouses. The same thing goes for data centers: if they could get away with it, Jeff Bezos would utilize everything in his power to have robots do it all. The drawback is, of course, what to do with all of those workers that are being displaced. But to folks like Bezos, that’s “not my problem”. What’s more likely, however, is that the AI bubble bursts and wipes out a large portion of these huge companies with it. LikeLike The other problem that no-one seems to want to address is if all those people are removed from the workforce, who picks up the spending slack they leave behind them? It’s all very well having robots do all the work for free but they aren’t going to make very effective consumers. Also, wasn’t Amazon actually using drones for delivery at one point? Or did that turn out to be just as stupid an idea as it always seemed at the time? LikeLike I was thinking about the economic losses caused by mass displacement of employees, but I’m sure Bezos and the others don’t care. They’ll have made their money so they don’t need to worry about it. Yes, Amazon is (still) looking into drones for delivery, but right now drones in the US have to be registered with the FAA if they go above a certain weight limit (which is very easy to breach; the drone I own is at the weight limit and the thing is incredibly light). If Bezos wanted to circumvent that, he’d have to bribe a lot more people to make it happen. Then he’d also have to deal with all of those folks with guns who’d shoot down drones flying near their property because “they’re spying on me!” (Before you laugh, the reason why I’ve not taken my own drone out much at all to inspect my gutters is that I do have neighbors like that.) LikeLike “WoW isn’t even really a big dollar game. It’s big to us as MMORPG fans, but it’s not anywhere near titles like CoD or the real kings: mobile game giants.” Agreed. But I do think that WoW/Minecraft contributed to an influx of people to those games also. In my wider theory I call those “normie games” because there has been Madden and Call of Duty for years but the audiences are minimally intermingled. Mobile games are yet another phenomenon that didn’t exist when WoW launched. They are the biggest wild card because as you said, cheap to develop and I think most people play them to some extent. And they aren’t usually live-in games like PC or normie console titles, so there is infinite appetite. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Amazon fires staffers via early-morning text messages during round of 14K job cuts: report

Some of the 14,000 workers Amazon began firing this week learned of their fate through an impersonal text-message blast, according to a new report. Amazon sent affected employees two text messages early Tuesday morning as the e-commerce giant launched a round of corporate job cuts, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One message urged employees to check their personal and work emails before coming into the office – in an effort to prevent laid-off staffers from showing up to work and discovering their badges no longer worked, according to the report. Just to be sure, Amazon sent a second text message directing employees to call a help desk if they had not received “an email message about your role,” Business Insider reported. Amazon declined to comment. Tuesday’s layoffs were the latest in Amazon’s efforts to “reduce bureaucracy” across its white-collar workforce, Beth Galetti, Amazon’s executive in charge of human resources, said in a memo to staffers. “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she stated. Some managers were told Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief laid-off employees once the emails were sent out, sources told Reuters. Several teams were impacted, including ones working on HR, devices, services and operations, according to the outlet. Impacted employees will be able to look for a new role internally. Otherwise, they will be offered severance pay, outplacement services and health benefits, according to Galetti’s memo. In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce – over the coming weeks, sources told Reuters. Another round of corporate cuts is expected in January, after the busy holiday shopping season, two people familiar with the matter told the New York Times. Amazon has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since Andy Jassy took over the helm from the company’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, in 2021. In June, Jassy urged employees to embrace automation and “help us reinvent the company.” He said new tech could create new job opportunities – though he also admitted it could bring “efficiency gains” by helping to reduce the overall workforce. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” Jassy wrote at the time. Amazon has already embraced robots and automation in its warehouses. The company plans to avoid hiring more than 600,000 warehouse employees in the coming years thanks to the new tech – even as it expects to sell twice as many items over the same period, according to a New York Times report. Amazon called the article “an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans.” In its most recent quarter, Amazon reported $18 billion in profit and ramped up its spending on AI data centers. Capital expenses, which include data centers, are expected to push past $120 billion this year – up nearly 50% from last year. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti wrote in her Tuesday memo. But “the world is changing quickly” and Amazon is focused on operating “more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership” to take advantage of AI opportunities, the exec explained.

Title: Amazon And Target Job Cuts Reveal How AI Is Reshaping The Retail Workforce

ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Retail job losses are surging, with Amazon and Target cutting nearly 32,000 corporate jobs combined, signaling a major industry restructuring. These early cuts, three times last year's pace, are driven by poor corporate performance, rising tariffs, and the growing impact of AI on administrative and managerial roles. Retail job losses are running three times ahead of last year’s pace through September, according to employment advisory firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Now Amazon and Target are becoming part of the broader trend. Each just announced plans to slash its corporate workforce up to 10%, with 31,800 jobs on the line. While the scale of job cuts differs by company size – and Amazon’s cutbacks cover more than retail-related positions – the losses within the retail sector are substantial. Coming this early in the season, well ahead of the typical post-holiday layoff peak in January and February, these cuts signal broader restructuring across one of the nation’s largest employment sectors. While different reasons are given for the layoffs, they collectively point to a structural weakness in the retail industry. The retail industry faces the perfect storm of poor corporate performance, tariff headwinds raising costs, and the growing power of AI to perform routine administrative and managerial tasks. In related news, Carter’s, the baby and children’s apparel company noted for the Carter’s and OshKosh B’Gosh brands, announced it will layoff 300 corporate staffers before the end of the year – 15% of its corporate workforce – and close 150 underperforming stores in North America over the next three years. The number of store employees affected was not revealed. Tariffs are blamed for much of the forced cost-cutting, with duties rising from $110 million in fiscal 2024 to between $200 million and $250 million this year. Currently, about 16 million Americans are employed in retail, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, now on hold due to the government shutdown. Nearly half (46%) hold frontline sales-related positions, while roughly one-fourth are in management, business, and financial roles (13%) or provide office/administrative support (10%) to those on the front lines. The rest are involved in other aspects of retail, most especially in production, transportation, and warehousing functions (23%). Overall, Challenger, Gray and Christmas reports retailers have cut 86,233 jobs through September – less than 1% of total employment – but more troubling, this year’s job cuts are up from 28,440 through the first nine months of 2024, a 203% increase. Even more concerning, U.S. employers across the board have cut just shy of one million jobs, up 55% from the first three-quarters of last year. This makes 2025 year-to-date total job losses the fifth-highest in the 36 years Challenger has been reporting this data. Hiring plans are also down 58% year-over-year to just over 200,000 new jobs, largely due to a sharp cutback in retail seasonal hiring. Through September, employer hiring plans are at their lowest point since 2009, during the Great Recession. In effect, many of the nation’s industries are dealing with the same factors that are taking away jobs in retail. “Right now, we’re dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases, and a transformative new technology,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s labor expert, in a statement. “Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,” While he believes a much-hoped-for interest rate cut could help stabilize the job market in the fourth quarter, the other factors impacting the labor market, in general, and retail in particular, are not going away and could get worse. According to numerous reports, Amazon is preparing to cut up to 30,000 corporate positions or about 10% of the corporate workforce. However, a blog post from Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology, stated only about 14,000 roles were on the immediate chopping block. Amazon reports on Thursday, so we may learn more about the layoff plans. If Amazon’s layoffs reach the 30,000 mark, it will be the company’s largest restructuring in history after letting 27,000 people go in 2023. It would also rank among the highest corporate layoffs over the last 25 years. In Galetti’s blog post, the layoffs are explained in familiar corporate talking points about streamlining bureaucracy and reallocating resources to better meet current and future customers’ needs. However, reading between the lines, they are largely pinned on AI. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” she wrote. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” GlobalData’s Neil Saunders reads the news as a “deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce,” noting the company has become more complex and layered over the years. He applauds the company for moving quickly in the face of rising costs affecting corporations across the board, yet he sees the restructuring as “a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” After Target announced plans last Thursday to eliminate 1,800 corporate jobs, including laying off 1,000 workers and closing 800 open job slots, pink slips went out on Tuesday to affected employees. Putting the blame on the usual suspects, in-coming CEO Michael Fiddelke wrote in a staff memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal, “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” It may be true that Target’s headquarters has become lethargic due to increased complexity in the corporate ranks, but the deeper truth is that Target has been hampered by 11 consecutive quarters of falling or weak comparable sales growth. While some of the blame for poor performance can be attributed to outside economic and competitive forces, that is likely not the largest part. Target’s controversial Pride Month offerings in 2023 sparked protests that turned off many culturally conservative shoppers. Then, earlier this year, the company decided to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion program (DEI), which raised the ire of many other shoppers, who have since abandoned the retailer amid calls to boycott it. Placer.ai, which tracks retail foot traffic, reports Target’s footfall has declined every month since January, including a 7.6% drop in September. Since boycotts were called February 28, Target’s average daily foot traffic has been off by 4.1% from the previous year, while Walmart’s has risen 7.2% in the same time period. The direction of change at Target has hurt employee morale, particularly after its DEI reversal. A company-wide survey earlier this year found about 40% of the 260,000 employees surveyed said they didn’t have confidence in the company’s future. No retailer can be expected to pull out of a sales tailspin with such a high level of dissatisfaction in its ranks. Hoped-for change emerged when longtime CEO Brian Cornell announced his retirement and Target-lifer Michael Fiddelke, noted for his financial expertise, previous efficiency initiatives and an advocate of technology transformation, would replace him this coming February 1. However, Cornell, chiefly responsible for the company’s unravelling, won’t be exiting the company but will move up to executive chair of the board. GlobalData’s Saunders is dismayed by what’s going on at Target, calling for a need to change the corporate culture. “Leadership has been in seeming denial about many of the challenges and has not been nearly open enough about them with either staff or stakeholders,” he said. The culture challenges are likely to be further exacerbated by the layoff news. “The job cuts will dampen morale at a company where the mood is already somber. That in turn will raise a question in many minds: why does the CEO who presided over the mess Target is now in get elevated to the position of Chairman, when so many others will lose their roles?” The story of these two companies – Amazon and Target – collectively reveals shared problems in retail, including rising costs, increased complexity and customers abandoning previously favored status brands for alternatives. While retailers look to consumer-facing AI as a way to re-engage customers – Amazon’s Rufus and “Buy For Me” AI shopping assistant, Target’s AI-powered “Bullseye Gift Finder” and Walmart’s “Instant Checkout” on ChatGPT – it is also enabling retailers to cut the headquarters’ fat. AI can increasingly do much of the work faster and more effectively than people. “The discussion about AI taking jobs, or at least good jobs, is generally framed as tomorrow’s problem. However, there are some hints that AI may already be taking ‘knowledge worker’ jobs,” commented J.P. Morgan’s chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli in a white paper. Microsoft just published a study entitled “Working with AI: Measuring the Applicability of Generative AI to Occupations,” which found that office and administrative support, business and financial operations, management, and sales-related jobs are among the top occupations most at risk of being replaced by AI. Retailers are top-loaded by all of those functions. Despite the popular belief that AI has yet to make a significant impact on the job market, Challenger, Gray and Christmas’ most recent report challenges that idea. It found that AI ranked third among the reasons for corporate job cuts in September, behind closures and market conditions. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon sees it accurately and while Walmart hasn’t announced any layoffs, it is holding the line on adding new staff. “It’s very clear that AI is going to change literally every job,” he said during a workforce conference with executives from other companies hosted at the company’s Bentonville headquarters and reported by Wall Street Journal. “Maybe there’s a job in the world that AI won’t change, but I haven’t thought of it.” Regrettably, some 32,000 employees of Amazon and Target are going to learn it the hard way.

Title: Amazon just made deep job cuts. Its AI tools now need to prove it can do more with less.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hello! Wednesday is as good an excuse as any for a happy hour. But when it comes to Wall Street's favorite watering holes, does the Financial District's Stone Street still have the juice? BI's William Edwards went to find out. In today's big story, Amazon's massive layoffs are in full swing. Could it be the start of something bigger across corporate America? What's on deck: Markets: Mulling a move to Dubai? The good (tax-free status) and bad (traffic jams) of living and working in UAE's biggest city. Tech: The dark reality many female founders face when raising money from VCs. Business: Getting laid off stinks. Here's what to do if it happens to you. But first, cuts are coming. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. If the AI war on human jobs is really beginning, consider this the shot heard round corporate America. Amazon hasn't outright said AI will replace the 14,000 jobs it eliminated on Tuesday. But the technology is clearly playing a key role in its decision to make some of the deepest job cuts in its history. And when it comes to tech, where one big company goes, others soon follow. That's why this could be the beginning of a series of mass AI layoffs, BI's Aki Ito writes. Some Amazon leaders are calling out AI in their message to staff in the wake of the cuts. Tapas Roy, Amazon's vice president of device software and services, told employees in an internal memo to "lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness." Meanwhile, Bob Carrigan, the CEO of Audible, didn't outright mention AI in a Tuesday email, but said there will be changes to "increase the speed of decision-making." And the pain might not be over at Amazon. Tuesday's layoffs mostly impacted early and mid-level managers in the retail division, according to internal data obtained by BI's Eugene Kim. But some fear AWS, which saw less than 1% of its staff affected, could be a target early next year. Amazon's job cuts could be a giant proof of concept for the new business it's betting on. Like everyone else in the AI race, one of Amazon's top priorities is proving its AI tools are worth the price of admission. That hasn't always been easy, as is evident by Amazon's Q Developer struggles. Talking about how great your tools are only gets you so far, though. When the owner of a bulletproof vest company wanted to sell his product, he strapped it on and shot himself in the chest multiple times. So what better way to advertise the benefits Amazon's AI tools can bring customers than starting with itself? Our tools are so efficient that we cut 14,000 people and didn't miss a beat. It's a massive risk, as failure would disrupt Amazon's business at a critical juncture and call into question the value of its AI products. But with so much on the line, and its back somewhat against the wall, Amazon might not have another choice. What it's like to work and live in Dubai. Migration to the expat-filled city is cementing the UAE's status as an international business center. BI's Bradley Saacks recently visited Dubai and spoke with those who have made the move to understand what life is like in the Gulf. The tax-free status and warm weather are nice perks, too. The (rate cut) show must go on. The ongoing government shutdown means there was no September jobs report, but the Fed is still expected to cut rates this week even without that missing data. Consumers could start to feel relief from lower mortgage and credit-card borrowing costs. How Goldman Sachs' managing directors get made. Goldman is expected to promote about 600 people — or 1% of staff — to the rank of MD. BI's Reed Alexander went behind the scenes for a glimpse of the secretive promotion process. The hidden cost of fundraising as a female founder. Venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig surveyed 180 women founders about building their startups. Though she didn't ask about sexual harassment on the job, they told her anyway. Female founders say it's still common while seeking venture capital, and two of them shared with BI what they experienced. The evolution of Elon Musk's pay package pitch. It's not the first time Tesla's board has asked shareholders to back a package. For Musk's latest $1 trillion pitch, Tesla is taking a more direct approach, explicitly addressing the fear of losing him as CEO. The top people in Mustafa Suleyman's circle.

Title: Amazon to End Development of New World: Aeternum as Part of Recent Layoffs

Amazon has confirmed its plans to sunset development on its MMO New World: Aeternum. As part of the latest round of layoffs, the game will not receive any new major updates across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. “After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates,” the team says in a statement. The New World: Aeternum team announced that the recent Nighthaven and Season 10 update “will serve as the final content release.” As part of the decision to shutter support for the game, the Nighthaven release is being made free to all players. Additionally, Rise of the Angry Earth is also being made free for PC players. In-game purchases will also continue to be supported. Amazon Games Orange County, the team behind the popular MMO, confirms that servers will be maintained. “In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum,” it’s said. As part of this ongoing process, players will be given “a minimum of six months’ notice” before any major changes are made to the ability to play the game. The shuttering of New World: Aeternum arrives soon after Amazon announced it is laying off around 14,000 employees. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that Amazon is “making organizational changes.” The mass layoff is affecting many different departments across the company. Beth Galetti, a senior executive at the company, sent a memo to staff explaining that those affected have 90 days to look for new roles internally. New World was first released on PC back in 2021. The game then built a sustainable player base before the major Aeternum update landed on October 15, 2024, with console support coinciding with the release.
