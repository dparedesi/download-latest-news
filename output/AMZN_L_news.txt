We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021.

The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile.

Title: Are Return-To-Office Mandates About Efficiency Or Cutting Costs?

Trying to find a balance isn't getting any easier. The Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental governing body headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is taking on remote work for government employees. The move by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce pushes back on remote work—especially if government workers quit as a result of the initiative. While 18% of the Fortune 500 companies require 100% full-time in-office work, it’s no secret that removing remote work as an option is reducing the workforce. A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term”, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers’ balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that’s the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That’s a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today’s workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders’ (or constituents’) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, “Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?” That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that’s why it’s called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the “conflict of the wages”? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Snowflake’s shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it’s going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street’s target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn’t prevent Snowflake’s loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That’s up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it’s now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. “We’ve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,” Ramaswamy said. However, the company’s chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street’s target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. “We feel good about what we’re doing, and we think there’s a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,” he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake’s recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake’s cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. “Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,” he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company’s strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. “As an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,” the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise’s hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. “Snowflake’s growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,” the analyst pointed out. “On the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.” The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn’t reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo’s tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake’s data warehouse. “By bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures — unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,” Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake’s hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic’s most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake’s AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake’s executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic’s Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake’s AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. “Our partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,” Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake’s stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.

Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More Gary Shapiro, the CEO of the CTA, has seen tech change over decades. I talked to him about his latest views of politics, tech and economic growth. He was blunt in his responses, and that reminded me of the title of his new book on innovation, dubbed Pivot or Die: How Leaders Thrive When Everything Changes. I spoke with Shapiro a day before the U.S. presidential election. I asked him about politics and tech in one of my early questions. But he first went on to tell me about CES 2025, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas that will happen in early January. After all, that’s job one for Shapiro, who, as CEO of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), has to make sure the massive trade show for technologists goes off without a hitch. We eventually circled back and talked about some political issues. He was particularly concerned about the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s “excessive” antitrust enforcement against the tech giants under the leadership of Democratic appointee Lina Khan. We also talked about the turbulent tech economy and how its been affected by the shadow of two major wars in the world. And we addressed the impact of AI on the tech industry. That led us to a discussion of the role of government in the tech industry, when it comes to both support and oversight. And I asked him about the chance we have for balanced growth — where revenues grow, AI gets accepted, and jobs grow too. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. VentureBeat: It’s good to see you getting another book out. Gary Shapiro: It’s still relevant. We just had a meeting today, the day before the election and 60 days before CES. We talked about the pivots we had made previously in the last few years as an organization. Given the uncertainty of what’s going to happen tomorrow, given the economy and everything else, the only thing that’s certain–well, something will happen. VentureBeat: This is going to run after the election, but what are some of your thoughts that link what you have in the book to your views of politics and tech? Shapiro: The CES is an amazing, powerful tech event. I was looking back at what you had written last year about it, before and after. A lot of people go with a very full agenda, but we always say you have to have time for serendipity and discovery. We have a new look, a new feel. We focused the campaign on “Dive in.” We’re inviting attendees to do three things: connect, solve, and discover. “Connect,” in the technology world–we want people to get together, through B2B and B2C. The statistic we’ve used before is that the average attendee has about 29 meetings during the show. It’s an important business event. You get that face to face. About 75% of attendees say their business is primarily B2B, or both B2B and B2C. We struggle with the name. Some people call it the Consumer Electronics Show, but it’s just CES. There’s so much there that’s B2B. That’s one of the changes that occurs for people when they discover. Another theme of the show is not only to connect, but to solve. We talked about human security for all, our work with the United Nations focusing on the sustainable development goals, focusing on fundamental human security in areas like health care, finances, personal safety. We see that in all sorts of ways. Of course accessibility is another big thing. Even for me, attending the show in 2024, that was one of the biggest surprises and themes. I don’t think I even talked about that before the show – how many people were there looking out on behalf of the disability community, and how many companies were responding to that with all sorts of technology. We have a meeting of the disability community before the show. We had to cut off attendance because there wasn’t enough room. Discovery or serendipity is the third theme, the trends we see. Some of it is a continuation, but some of it is new. Obviously AI is still a big thing. It pervades almost every category. Digital health is also very big. Mobility is huge with electric vehicles and connected cars, autonomy, sustainability. We’ve done our own pivots as well. The concept of electricity being available is not something we’ve talked about at CES before. Now we have a whole conference track on it. With electric cars, generative AI, and quantum, they all use tremendous amounts of electricity that we’re not prepared for. Not surprising to me, a number of companies in the last month have announced deals with nuclear power plants and things like that, which is totally new, but it’s a way of dealing with it. We’ll have that. We’ll have exhibitors focusing on energy savings on the supply side, heat reduction, local production. We’ll also have panels talking about how we can look at the electric grid. Similarly to that vein, we’ll have a shift that we haven’t had before to quantum computing. We have a half day of programming on that. While AI and generative AI is currently the thing, now generative AI doesn’t get you to the finish line with a lot of things, for example in health care. It’s a whole shift upwards in computing that we haven’t had in a long time. The other great thing about CES, we have the most powerful group of keynotes we’ve ever had. You heard about Delta earlier this week. We’ll continue to announce more. This is our first keynote in the Sphere, Ed Bastian. Delta is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Their shift to becoming a technology company is centered around CES. In mobility we also have the Volvo Group. We have a first-time exhibitor, OshKosh. You may only know them from kids’ clothing, but they also have a huge business where they dominate in fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency vehicles. They want to show what they can do against some of the other mobility companies. And how could I not mention Nvidia? This is Jensen Huang’s third time keynoting. It’s a big shift from the last time. I’ve known Jensen for a very long time. I’m sure you’ve known him longer. It’s the hottest company there is right now. VentureBeat: At one point it was one of 80 graphics chip companies. Shapiro: I wish I’d bought their stock, but hey. And we have many other new exhibitors. Foxconn, Komatsu, Scout Motors. I think the number I heard at our staff meeting today is at least 400 new companies. VentureBeat: How do you feel about how the tech companies feel right now as far as the strength of the tech economy? It feels to me like some elements are very out of sync with each other. The AI boom is happening for a lot of the tech industry, but the game industry is coming off 30 months of layoffs. It’s fairly weak. Hollywood feels like it’s also been on the ropes in many ways. These things that used to be so tied together feel like they’re on different economic cycles. Shapiro: Certainly there’s economic uncertainty. If you think about it, COVID was devastating to the economy, but good for the tech industry. It forced people to stay home and play games and watch movies and build home offices and invest in all these things. People invested in their homes. Then we had the government fueling a tremendous amount of cash into the economy. Every time I’m trying to drive around the Detroit area, there’s construction projects on top of construction projects. Obviously they don’t talk to each other, so it takes a long time to drive anywhere. What’s obviously also changed in the last couple of years, we’ve had a couple of major wars going on. There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. The economic uncertainty sometimes builds on itself until we talk ourselves into a recession. The tech industry is positive and promising a better future, better solutions. Certainly there’s a dislocation going on with the skills that are needed. Because of generative AI, a lot of companies are trying to hire people who know how to deal with generative AI and try to make them more efficient. Some of the people who were really hot a few years ago, software people, are less so. In the free market economy there’s some dislocation going on. In the long run it’ll work out for the better of everyone, but in the short there are some personally painful situations. Anyone who’s running an organization, the last thing you want to do is lay off people. But it’s the reality. The other thing that’s going on, and we’ll know in a week or two whether it will continue–the federal government, the Federal Trade Commission, has been pretty tough on tech. The chairman of the FTC literally wrote her thesis that made her famous about why Amazon is so terrible. She believes big companies should not acquire small companies. That isn’t something that’s been pervasive. The positive thing is, a lot of tech people supporting the Democrats and Harris, those same tech people are saying that she’s gotta go. Not all of them, but a lot of them. On the Republican side, obviously–I could get into the details a lot on this issue. JD Vance has said he kind of likes her. Who knows what Donald Trump thinks? It’s unlikely he would keep a Democratic chairman of the FTC, especially because she rules like such an authoritarian. Changed the antitrust standards. Literally, there’s a report that just came out Wednesday or Thursday last week from the House oversight committee laying out in very clear detail what happened with Amazon and iRobot and others, how they’ve gone to Europe and tried to stop American companies and gotten fines put on them. Also, internal emails showing that they intentionally tried to keep large companies from buying small companies. Not just through the lawsuits, which is the tangible side. They’ve lost almost every one of them at the FTC. But just the threats. Acquisition activity has gone down, and therefore startup activity has gone down, because startup investors don’t see the exits they used to see. That adds to an uncertain economy. There’s a different level of investment. VentureBeat: I see part of this playing out in a different way on my level. Epic Games has been at war with Apple over antitrust issues for quite a while now. The platform companies extract their fees. They hold the most power in the industry. They’re the biggest companies. The developer companies are underneath paying these 30% fees. Is that holding back growth from happening? Those big companies are getting bigger. Apple is getting bigger. But the developers of those technologies can’t necessarily move on to the next generation if they’re paying 30% of the top line to platform companies. But it’s not a black and white issue. Shapiro: There are two issues there. One is, what is the federal government’s role? I would maintain that it’s been overly aggressive, anti-American, anti-big tech, expressly so. It’s not only the U.S. It’s a global situation. For the most part our companies dominate the world. There’s a legitimate question about the role of the federal government. Plus they’ve changed the standard, which President Carter put into place almost 50 years ago, which is what’s best for consumers, not what’s best to protect existing competitors. Those are big changes. I believe they’ve been very unhealthy for tech and the U.S. economy in general. On the other hand, there are private lawsuits, which is what you’re talking about. We’ve stayed out of that. I would agree with you that there are arguments on both sides. On the one hand, you can take each of the platforms and say they’ve enabled X hundreds of thousands, or even millions of new businesses to do business on their platforms. Before this technology revolution they wouldn’t even exist. It’s not just one platform. There are several. They keep coming alive. Everyone thinks that once they have this exclusive hold–the history of technology has shown that it’s hard to come up with a platform that survives for more than 20 or 30 years. They seem to be eclipsed. If you look at the different search engines and the different selling platforms that come along–to me that’s something for the courts to work out on the basis of those private lawsuits, whether you’ve taken advantage of something in a way that’s wrong or unfair. But companies do have a right to do business and try to grow. We have a right to know what the law is. In some cases Congress hasn’t done their job. They sometimes come up with a compromise that’s intentionally ambiguous. What has changed, and radically so, is that the Supreme Court came out with a case several months ago saying the agencies can’t do anything other than what Congress says they can do. They can’t fill the gaps. That’s already created a huge number of lawsuits challenging regulations and government action. In the private antitrust area–these antitrust lawsuits are expensive on both sides. I have mixed feelings. I started out as an antitrust lawyer. I have a lot of experience in this area and I follow it closely. In the U.S. there are litigation costs that no one else has. Both sides pay a lot for antitrust lawsuits. There are treble damages. It’s very unusual. I just wish there was a better way of creating legal certainty. At CES, we have the best thing for competition in the world. Trade shows are great because you get to see all the competitors lined up. We’re seeing it play out in so many areas. We see it in electric vehicles. I was reading a Wall Street Journal story about the Latin American market for electric vehicles, because the U.S. and Europe are shutting them out. Competition is an amazing thing. It drives down prices for consumers. VentureBeat: A good question is, what’s going to be the way to something like an open metaverse? How can you ensure that it will be open and accessible so that we get the best of all economies that come from it? Shapiro: Things have a way of working themselves out. If you make something too closed it doesn’t work. That goes all the way back to VHS and Beta. Sony had the better technology by almost every definition, but Matsushita was smart enough to license out theirs to everyone. VentureBeat: Or America Online. Shapiro: Right, and all the systems before and after that. I hear you. If you don’t allow returns on investment for the companies that are there first, you don’t get investment. The bottom line is, we have to create a system if we want to be a winning country. You have to be willing to change your response to circumstances. Many of these companies are going through a rough patch, but they have to pivot. COVID allowed every company to pivot in a way they’d never done before. That was to the benefit of tech as well. What I talk about a lot in the book a lot is, who can pivot quicker? A big company or a small one? The truth is, a small company can pivot quicker by far. They can adjust. That’s why big companies like to acquire them. A big company has the capital and the infrastructure, but they’re always protecting their existing moneymakers. VentureBeat: You mentioned that a lot of companies pivoted during the pandemic. Do you feel like this is a time for pivoting again, for any particular reason, in the post-COVID era? Do companies have to change one more time? Shapiro: What’s changed since COVID is that–certainly we focus on our health. That will always be important. Tech provides a lot of solutions there. That’s why generative AI and health tech and telemedicine and all these things are so important. We have–again, talking very specifically about this moment in time, where we have what feels like an equally divided election, where all three bodies of government are equally up for grabs, where we have an economy that’s so uncertain. The Fed lowered interest rates by half a point and there was no response. The long-term yield hasn’t changed, which is unprecedented. They’re meeting the day after the election as we’re talking about another quarter point. At the same time inflation seems to feel high, although the numbers don’t indicate it. Consumers are whiplashed. The university system, the educational system is under dramatic change. There’s a lot of pressure to cause a lot of change very quickly. We have two pretty significant wars that are going on that are very new. VentureBeat: We still don’t know what the true effect of AI is going to be. Shapiro: We’ve seen already that generative AI is having positive effects, a lot of efficiency and improved competence. We’re seeing promise in health care very quickly. I’m an optimist. I think it’s going to be great. I think we’re going to solve fundamental problems. That’s what CES is about, solving these problems. Generative will be there. But that also comes with new problems. When we focus on efficiency we get a lot of things. We get the products the Department of Energy certifies as Energy Star compliant from us, from our companies. But that was the products themselves. I don’t think we focused on the energy business the way we do now. If you look at the numbers, the numbers don’t lie. If generative AI truly does take off, that’s a lot of energy. The same with electric cars. Energy has to come from somewhere. The same with quantum. This is definitely a transformational period in our technological history. There are new challenges. With all these new challenges, you have to pivot. What I talk about in the book, there are certain things that force pivots. We had COVID. We have to change quickly in response to external forces. Or what Microsoft just did with the nuclear power plant. There are startup pivots, where you get new opportunities, new equipment. That’s where startups are at. Then there are failure pivots, where you know your business is going down, and if you don’t succeed, you try again. VentureBeat: The media business is front and center for that one. Shapiro: It is. I just saw the headline today. Marc Benioff is looking at selling Time. I was wondering what value it had. A lot of tech moguls bought media properties. Jeff Bezos was in the news this week because of the Washington Post [he had killed an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris]. There’s a lot of stuff going on. It seems like you’ve figured it out. You write more words than anyone I know. VentureBeat: The interesting thing to me is that some people feel like tech and government, tech and politics, have always been different topics, not tied together so much. But I remember this one program way back. George Gilder was talking about how tech companies bring themselves up by their bootstraps and get things done, and they’re so much more efficient than anything related to the government. And then Andy Grove was in the same session, and he said, you know, does it give you no pause that all of us, all the chip companies were born because of the space program? It was an interesting moment to hear that government and technology have gone hand in hand over many years. Shapiro: They have. If you look back to developments in telecommunications, a lot of it is government procurement. They’re the biggest customer. On the other hand the government can also slow it down. Look what they did with AT&T. Look what they did with Microsoft. They spent years killing it off just on the basis of the search engine, which makes no sense. A lot of the government actions against the big tech companies prove to be irrelevant, but they do distract the companies and their senior leadership in a big way. Generative AI is one area where China has definite advantages over the free market system, given the lack of focus on privacy and their strategic focus on it. There’s more of an international competition going on in a non-war environment than any other time. When the government has gotten its act together in the U.S., it’s been World War II and other things. That’s when technology worked well with the government. Right now, is technology working well with the government? I’m not sure. I don’t know if I have a good answer. In some ways, yes. AI is one area. Generative AI is one area where the government, the federal government at least, has taken a very reasonable approach. It started with Trump and continued with Biden. The only challenge is, just as with self-driving cars, Congress has been rather slow to react. Congress, especially the Senate side, they’ve really engaged in some listening, and they recognize that premature action is probably going to be less helpful than anything. But I don’t think the private sector is looking to the government on generative AI for anything other than guardrails. We say, because we believe in this as an organization–the mistake that Europe has made on AI is they made it so difficult and expensive for any startup to get involved. That’s not healthy. We don’t want to be like Europe. Going forward, we’ll know by January which direction we’ll be going in terms of government. VentureBeat: One thing I hope, and I wonder whether you agree–eventually we’ll get to balanced growth, which to me would mean revenues for the industries all keep growing. Jobs also stabilize and keep growing. People hire a lot of people. And we embrace new technology like AI. We don’t get these things out of sync – AI advances and all of a sudden jobs disappear. That’s not what we want. Or revenue grows but no hiring happens. If they could all synchronize and be together – people accept new technology, people get jobs, and revenues grow for companies. Shapiro: What I’ve learned in my career is that you never get to perfect, but you just try to do better than you did last year. The definition of perfect changes. I don’t think, in a free market economy, that perfect is where everyone gets to keep their jobs. You have to learn new skills. There is another theory out there, though, which is that it will add more free time, and that will generate its own economic growth. My wife goes to a lot of medical conferences, and there’s a generational difference between doctors in that the incoming doctors don’t want to work as hard. They want regular hours. They don’t want the lengthy hours. Today that’s a front page story in the Wall Street Journal. I’ve been talking about this for two years now. It’s true, and I know this because I’ve talked to enough doctors in different fields about it. People want time now. It probably predated COVID. People value experience and time. That’s what it is. There are two theories. One is the one you mentioned. I don’t want to call it old school, but it’s based on traditional economics. Economic growth can solve big problems with debt. Economic growth can lift up everyone. Economic growth should not cost jobs. And the way you do that is you get people trained differently and quickly. That’s one thing Trump did a lot of. He doesn’t get credit for it, but the whole white collar apprentice concept of hiring people and training. That’s one thing he was personally focused on with his daughter Ivanka. I worked with them a lot on that. They had major strides. The Biden people kept it up. But guaranteeing employment, making it more difficult to fire people, putting European restrictions on letting people go and how much you have to pay them–we’ve already seen some of that. You can’t have non-disclosure agreements. You have to disclose salaries. You can’t ask people what they’ve been paid. You can’t do all these things. That’s a shift toward a more European way. But there is that third way, where people start talking about guaranteed income, basic income and things like that. Studies have shown that it doesn’t really work very well, because then people don’t work. If nothing happens then they’re not necessarily happy. My belief in life is that people are happy if they’re productive, if they have some type of job or volunteering where they do something good. A lot of these discussions will occur. I don’t think it’s next year’s issue. Several years ahead, I think you’re right. People will talk about it. I’ve been in the room with President Trump where he’s in with companies committing to how many people they will train and hire. They make commitments. First there was no follow-through. We didn’t make that commitment, because we’re an association. A lot of our members made commitments, but you can’t make commitments like that because the economy is so volatile. It’s very difficult. It was an interesting time. Trump tried to establish himself as a president for the working class. If he’s elected again, I’m pretty sure he’s not going to go back there. He’ll talk about AI in that way. But I also think Harris will talk about AI in that way if she’s elected. We’ll see. The federal government is imposing rules. The question is whether they’ll put up the type of strictures that have made Europe very non-competitive, non-innovative, and non-productive. The number one export from Europe is now regulation.

Title: What Trump 2.0 means for tech and AI regulation
URL: https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2024/11/what-trump-20-means-tech-and-ai-regulation/401161/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T14:00:00Z

MIT professor Max Tegmark and Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson discuss what AI policy might look like under the next Trump Administration at the 2024 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Camille Tuutti Stay Connected By Camille Tuutti A second Trump administration could reshape U.S. and global tech industries, with deregulation, artificial intelligence safety and Elon Musk’s growing influence at the forefront. These potential shifts were discussed at Lisbon’s Web Summit during the Nov. 12 session “A New Trump Era,” moderated by NPR CEO Katherine Maher. “Pod Save the People” host DeRay Mckesson and “West Wing” actor Richard Schiff explored how Trump’s second presidency might impact the tech world. Schiff began the session by comparing tech’s growing influence to that of the oil industry, highlighting its ability to drive policy and accumulate wealth. “I think Elon Musk has already doubled his wealth since last Tuesday,” he said. “And tech to me . . . might very likely be the new oil in that it's going to affect policy because the money is there and the power is there.” Schiff said he doubted the Trump administration would regulate tech or address monopolies, a stance he said benefits the industry but raises equity concerns. “The most important tech person in the world has now become the shadow vice president and, if not more, so I think the tech industry is going to get whatever they want,” he said, referring to Musk. “Are we going to stop monopolies? Probably not. Are we going to regulate? Probably not. Maybe that's great for tech, I don't know. I don't know how good it is for the world, the country.” Mckesson turned the conversation to Musk’s leadership, criticizing his tenure at X for making the platform more ideological, despite Musk’s claims to oppose such tendencies. He compared Musk’s polarizing approach to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s growing reputation as a more moderate leader. “[Zuckerberg] was a villain for so long in Silicon Valley,” Mckesson said. “Now, he's sort of the sane person left standing, it seems. So it'll be interesting to see what he does with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — these places that are in the ecosystem that is not Twitter.” Maher then shifted the discussion to AI, asking whether a stronger AI sector could bolster national security. Schiff offered a cultural perspective, suggesting that tough times often ignite creativity. “The silver lining, for me, might be that in authoritarian societies, the best art comes out of the more compressed artists feel, the more expression they end up having,” he said. “There's that darkness that there's light somewhere.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration At a Nov. 13 panel titled “Did Elon Musk Destroy Twitter?” panelists examined Musk’s leadership style and its implications as the proposed head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Kate Conger, a New York Times tech reporter, argued Musk’s drastic cost-cutting measures at X could serve as a blueprint for how he might address federal bureaucracy. “Musk's campaign to downsize Twitter is really a model for what he wants to do for the federal government, and in a lot of ways, it's empowered him to pursue this role,” she said. She pointed to Musk’s perceived success in maintaining X operations after massive layoffs that gutted 75% of the workforce. “Despite some small outages, it still has continued to run, and so he must feel very empowered by that and feels that he can make these deep cuts to the government and bureaucracy,” she said Ryan Mac, another New York Times tech reporter, brought up Musk’s potential conflicts of interest leading DOGE. Tesla and SpaceX, both of which rely on federal contracts, are under at least 20 federal investigations, according to NYT reporting, he said. As DOGE head, Musk could wield significant influence over the agencies regulating his companies, Mac added. “If there is a situation at the [Federal Aviation Administration], which oversees Tesla and SpaceX, could [Musk] have his finger on the scale to change what the FAA does?” Mac asked. “We just don't know. I think that potential is pretty scary.” AI policy and power concentration Trump has suggested rolling back President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI, a move that could shutter the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the institute addresses risks to national security, public safety and individual rights. During the panel “Is AI the Answer or the Problem?” Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson explored whether Musk’s outspoken concerns about AI risks might influence Trump to adopt stricter AI policies instead of loosening regulations to compete with China. She asked MIT professor Max Tegmark if Musk’s views could shape Trump’s approach to AI governance. “I hope so,” Tegmark said, stressing the need to educate leaders about AI’s dangers. “You don't actually need to persuade them that they shouldn't want to be replaced by and dominated by some new weird machine species. They are already against that. It's just a matter of education.” Tegmark expressed optimism that Musk could help Trump grasp the national security risks posed by uncontrolled AI and the economic importance of building safe, manageable AI. “I'm definitely hoping that Elon can help Donald Trump understand that this is just not in America's national security interests that American companies build something that we lose control over in two years, and that the real path to prosperity in America and even strength is to build AI tools that can be controlled,” he said. Olson also highlighted the growing concentration of AI power, pointing out how companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google are snapping up smaller startups. Tegmark identified two major risks: the dominance of a few companies and humanity losing control over powerful AI systems. Despite these concerns, Tegmark ended on a hopeful note, highlighting AI’s potential to solve global challenges if developed responsibly. “With AI, there's so many things we would love to do but just haven't figured out how to do — prevent our loved ones from dying of diseases and safeguard our climate and so on and so forth,” he said. “And if we can get this right with tool AI, we can have a more amazing future than we ever dreamt of.” This year’s Web Summit attracted over 71,500 attendees from around the globe, according to a LinkedIn post by the event's organizers, including industry leaders, policymakers and innovators.

Title: Inside Amazon's agonizing attempt to save Alexa with AI

Time Published: 2024-11-19T19:04:43Z

Your browser does not support the video element. Amazon's Alexa seems like the perfect product for the generative AI era. Getting this powerful technology to actually work well with the digital assistant is a monumental challenge that's been plagued by gnarly technical problems and repeated delays. Customer-friction concerns, partnership hiccups, compatibility questions, latency problems, and accuracy issues have snarled progress, according to internal Amazon documents and multiple people involved in the project. The Alexa team is under immense pressure to get something out. A decade ago it launched with Echo speakers and became a household name. But that early success fizzled and the business has so far failed to become profitable, leading to drastic cutbacks and layoffs in recent years. Some company insiders consider this AI moment to be a seismic opportunity for Alexa, and potentially the last chance to reignite consumer interest in the voice assistant through the power of large language models. A product of this scale is "unprecedented, and takes time," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. "It's not as simple as overlaying an LLM onto the Alexa service." One of the main challenges facing the new Alexa relates to how the digital assistant will interact with other companies and services, and who is responsible for customers if their requests, orders, and payments don't go smoothly. In late August, Amazon was working on integrating 8 third-party applications, including Uber and Ticketmaster, into the upcoming AI-powered Alexa to handle various user inquiries. At that time, the goal was to launch the new Alexa around mid-October, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. However, it was still unclear which companies would be responsible for customer support issues, like payment and delivery errors, this document stated. The lack of clarity could cause Amazon to send "frequent" customer contacts to the partner companies. Then, those partners would sometimes redirect the users back to Amazon, the document explained. "This level of support would cause significant customer friction, when some of the orders/purchases are time-sensitive (meal orders or rideshare trips) and purchase mistakes can be expensive (e.g. buy Taylor Swift tickets)," the document said, assigning it a "RED" warning. Snafus like this have caused Amazon to push back the release date, almost on a weekly basis, according to some of the people involved in the project, which has been codenamed "Banyan" or "Remarkable Alexa." BI's sources asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to talk to the press. For example, without more clearly defined responsibilities with third-party partners, Amazon expected further delays in the launch. "Alignment on customer support plans between Product teams and the 3P partners may push this timeline further out if any delays occur," one of the documents warned. The company had once planned for a June launch, but after repeated delays, it told employees late last month that the new Alexa would launch "no earlier" than November 20, one of the documents said. A few of people BI spoke with recently are even talking about the Alexa upgrade rolling out in early 2025, which would miss the key holiday period. Bloomberg earlier reported on a 2025 launch plan. As of late October, Amazon had not settled on an official brand for the updated voice assistant, and instructed employees to simply call it the "new Alexa" until further notice, one of the documents said. To be sure, Alexa has significant long-term potential in the generative AI era — as long as Amazon can iron out problems relatively quickly. Time is of the essence, partly because the existing Alexa business has lost momentum in recent years. According to a recent report from eMarketer, user growth for major voice assistants, including Alexa, has declined significantly in recent years. The sudden rise of ChatGPT has showcased what is possible when powerful AI models are integrated smoothly with popular products that consumers and companies find useful. Some Amazon leaders are bullish about the AI-powered Alexa and a new paid subscription service that could come with it. At least one internal estimate projected a 20% conversion rate for the paid subscription, one of the people said. That would mean that out of every 100 existing Alexa users, roughy 20 would pay for the upgraded offering. Amazon doesn't publicly disclose the number of active Alexa users but has said it has sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices. An internal description of the new Alexa shows Amazon's grand ambitions: "A personalized digital assistant that can handle a wide range of tasks, including drafting and managing personal communications, managing calendars, making reservations, placing orders, shopping, scouting for deals and events, recommending media, managing smart home devices, and answering questions on virtually any topic," one of the documents said. Customers will be able to access the new Alexa "through natural language using voice, text, email, shared photos, and more across all their devices like Echo, Fire TV, mobile phones, and web browsers," it added. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar vision during last month's earnings call, saying the new Alexa will be good at not just answering questions, but also "taking actions." In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said the company's vision for Alexa is to build the world's "best personal assistant." "Generative AI offers a huge opportunity to make Alexa even better for our customers, and we are working hard to enable even more proactive and capable assistance on the over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world. We are excited about what we're building and look forward to delivering it for our customers," the spokesperson said. Still, the project has grappled with several challenges, beyond customer friction and partnership problems. Latency has been a particularly tough problem for the AI Alexa service. In some tests, the new Alexa took about 40 seconds to respond to a simple user inquiry, according to three people familiar with the test results. In contrast, a Google Search query takes milliseconds to respond. To speed up, Amazon considered using a smaller AI model, like Anthropic's Claude Haiku, to power the new Alexa, one of the people said. But that dropped the quality and accuracy of the answers, leaving Amazon in limbo, this person said. In general, smaller language models generate quicker responses than larger models but can be less accurate. Amazon had initially hoped to use a homegrown AI model, one of the people said. Last year, Alexa head scientist Rohit Prasad left the team to create a new Artificial General Intelligence group at Amazon. The stated goal of the new team was to create Amazon's "most expansive" and "most ambitious" large language models. However, this AGI team has not produced notable results so far, which led Amazon to consider Anthropic's main Claude offering as the primary AI model for the new Alexa, this person said. Reuters previously reported that Amazon was going to mainly power Alexa with Claude. Amazon's spokesperson said Alexa uses Amazon Web Services's Bedrock, an AI tool that gives access to multiple language models. "When it comes to machine learning models, we start with those built by Amazon, but we have used, and will continue to use, a variety of different models — including Titan and future Amazon models, as well as those from partners — to build the best experience for customers," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also added a note of caution by highlighting the difficulties of successfully integrating large language models with consumer applications. These models are great for conversational dialogue and content creation, but they can also be "non-deterministic and can hallucinate," the spokesperson added. Getting these models "to reliably act on requests (rather than simply respond) means it has to be able to call real-world APIs reliably and at scale to meet customer expectations, not just in select instances," the spokesperson explained. In late August, Amazon discovered several new risk factors for the AI Alexa service. Only 308 of more than 100,000 existing Alexa "skills," or voice-controlled applications, were compatible with the new Alexa, presenting a "high risk for customers to be frustrated," one of the documents explained. Some older Echo devices would not be able to support the AI-powered Alexa, the document also warned. And there were no plans for expanding the new service to dozens of overseas markets where Alexa is currently available, leaving a large user base out of touch, it also noted. Fortune previously reported some of these risk factors. As of late August, Amazon had 8 "confirmed" partner companies to handle certain tasks for the new Alexa, as BI previously reported. The company hopes to onboard roughly 200 partners by the third year of the new Alexa's launch, one of the documents said. Integrating with some of these companies has already created headaches. One document said that Amazon struggled to develop a consistent troubleshooting process across every partner service. Companies including Uber, Ticketmaster, and OpenTable have deprecated their existing Alexa skills, further disconnecting them from the voice assistant. Amazon's spokesperson said that, as with any product development process, a lot of ideas are discussed and debated, but "they don't necessarily reflect what the experience will be when we roll it out for our customers." Amazon has also anticipated customer complaints, at least in the early launch phase. One internal document from late August stated that the new Alexa was projected to receive 176,000 customer contacts in the first three months of its release. At one point, Amazon considered launching a new automated troubleshooting service for issues related to its devices and digital services, including Alexa, according to one of the internal documents. That was later shelved. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip? Contact the reporter, Eugene Kim, via the encrypted-messaging apps Signal or Telegram (+1-650-942-3061) or email (ekim@businessinsider.com).

Title: Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves

Full Content:
Failures We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&T–>Time Warner–>Warner Brothers Discovery merger process has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands. What was supposed to be a gambit by these companies to dominate streaming TV, wound up being a very expensive act of seppuku by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths. With streaming subscription growth saturated, the market has been forced to get “creative” in order to feed Wall Street its expected quarterly returns. That has meant sagging quality control for streaming services like Max, and a steady parade of price hikes that generally haven’t been worth it. Speaking on the company’s recent conference call, Time Warner Discovery executives are making it clear that all manner of new restrictions and price hikes are on the way, just in case you were looking forward to more of that sort of thing. Among them will be a crackdown on the diabolical “password sharing” the industry used to view as helpful free advertising: “During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it’s gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with “very soft messaging” toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said. Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” Executives say they’re also exploring, like Amazon, steadily increasing the number of ads paying customers see. And they will, of course, just be rising prices steadily until they see a mass exodus of subscribers: “WBD also hinted at potential price hikes for Max today. During the earnings call, JB Perrette, WBD’s CEO and president of global streaming and games, noted that although Max has raised US subscription prices twice in the past two years, WBD believes it can get away with even higher prices: “We think the premium nature of our product in particular lends us to be – to have a fair amount of room to continue to push price.” Except the “premium nature” of the product doesn’t exist anymore. Any cachet enjoyed from the HBO brand has largely been killed off thanks to executives’ prioritization of lower-quality reality TV dreck as they pursue lowest common denominator engagement bait at scale. There’s still occasionally good art on Max; but the heyday of HBO as a prestige production empire is long, long dead. Meanwhile the kind of things that customers actually want (lower prices, better quality, better customer service) cost money and erode those sweet quarterly returns. The kinds of things customers and labor don’t want (price hikes, sagging quality, layoffs, weird new restrictions on access) are where the current growth and revenue boosting resides. So guess what you’re going to get. It’s not enough for a publicly traded company to provide an affordable product that people really like. That doesn’t achieve exponential, impossible growth. To get that (or the illusion of that) requires a certain aggressive creativity. And if streaming can’t obtain it via annoying price hikes and restrictions, as Time Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav has made clear, they’ll achieve it with pointless new harmful mergers under Trump. These folks insist they’re just engaging in the cold calculus of cost efficiency, but you’ll notice that excessive and unwarranted executive compensation somehow always avoids scrutiny. Again, I suspect what’s next for the industry is a whole bunch more consolidation and mergers to try and minimize any serious price competition and to nab tax breaks. From there I suspect you’ll start seeing a greater fixation on finding creative new ways to “reduce churn,” which will likely (now that the FTC will be lobotomized under Trump) include complicated new tricks to make cancelling services more difficult. When customers inevitably revolt and flock back to piracy (which is already starting to happen), execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!), and the innovation and disruption cycle will repeat itself all over again. Filed Under: cable, competition, consolidation, disruption, mergers, streaming, time warner discovery, tv, video Companies: warner bros. discovery I share my streaming stuff with my partner. Thing is, because of my stepdaughter education I live in 2 different addresses. Since I’d have to pay added fees for more than one service I decided a vpn was the least expensive way to deal with the issue for now. Customer service was utterly useless to deal with this on all of them. I already canceled Netflix because of the price hikes and because the content isn’t worth it and from the looks of it more services are joining it soon. I’m already planning some Plex setup for the kid because we all know where this shit is going to. And a bottle of rum. You have been watching too many videos that are rated “Arrr!” Hadn’t watched Amazon Prime in a while and when I did it literally started with 6 ads. Now I think of it like warming up the air fryer. Hit watch and know I’ve got 5 minutes to do something else. The “premium nature” of the product seems to only be the price. By this logic, the more customers pay, the more it’s worth. And since every service raise their price, the more the market worth. But how to explain to customers that they need to pay to please shareholders they don’t even know? Well, just ask Trump to declare that cancelling a subscription is illegal. TV Industry: “We will merge until your options are content at an infinite price or no content.” I’m wondering why the shareholders don’t sue the WBD Board of Directors over Zaslav’s absurd compensation, considering the stock’s horrible performance. None of the streaming services are “premium” enough to keep me interested for more than a month or two out of every 12 so that’s all I give them. Put them all together, and it’s not even 12 months so sometimes I just watch Hoopla and Kanopy and read a book. execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!) Woke decline wasn’t evident until this past year or late 2023 at earliest. The spastic woke energy that erupted after George Floyd’s death was purposefully directed into the institutions over the next 24 months and then plateaued late 2023 to early 2024 and then started on a slight downward gradient until 10/7. I don’t think Trump will calm things down. But this time I think there are people in his orbit who ‘get it’ and will be very capable and aggressive in terms of how they use the bureaucracy and administrative law. Please define “woke” in objective terms within the context in which you’re using it. Is it too “woke” to provide healthcare to pregnant women who experience difficulties during child gestation? Why is it that so many maga men want to see all women suffer and die needlessly? Is it “woke” to be offended by such hateful actions? A complete misunderstanding. Which seems to be purposeful here. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” “Your body, my choice” will be met with “Your crotch, my boot” Get back to me when the man can say abort, I don’t want to support that child. “I don’t want to support that child.” Well then, keep it in your pants. Is this too difficult for you? Keep your legs closed. Is that too difficult for you? A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy. And yes, historically, considering the number of unplanned pregnancies, it is difficult for some people to abstain. “Try not getting a cold your entire life!” Thanks, doctor dude! A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy Nor is a consenting man consenting to financial burden Then consenting man should consent to wearing a rubber, fool. That’s not a matter of consent, but a matter of law. Genetic donors are typically considered legally required to provide support of some kind. I don’t consent to having to mow my lawn, but the city will fine me if I don’t. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” The only reason you give a shit about women’s sports is so you can exclude a mere handful of people from it. You wouldn’t give a shit otherwise. Hell, you don’t even seem to give a shit about the idea of “biological women” playing in men’s sports⁠—and that’s because I’ve never seen anyone who rails against trans women do the same schtick for trans men. It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it. Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL…There is a reason they don’t. Maybe one day you will figure it out. Figure what out? What does sports have to do with women’s healthcare? Are you addicted to adderall like your hero Donald? Don’t know what it is. But since you are accusing… Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL… There is a reason they don’t. It’s because men needlessly feel ashamed when outperformed by women in any sport. Exactly! Hence the wnba What is a woman? It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it You make it sound so, binary Adjective; 1) anything I don’t like. 2) anything for the benefit of anyone who isn’t me (see 1). by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths You make it sound like pointless mergers are a bad thing. The executives keep getting over-compensated, so they’re happy. Who gives a fuck that everyone else is unhappy. When customers inevitably revolt Would be nice if we could have that revolt now, and skip this whole cycle of enshittifying. Instead of increasing the subscription count after the password crackdown, for once. Welcome to the USAnian Consumer’s Front. In the old days, TV programs were free to the viewer because networks ran ads. We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. Then we got tired of ads and decided to pay networks to show up content without ads, which led to cable channels such HBO, Showtime, and so on. Then it let to services like Netflix, which had movies and TV shows in one place. But now we have to pay for content AND watch commercials? AND the length of the commercials is as long as, or LONGER THAN, networks TV?? How long will it take until people stop putting up with it? Do the executives not realize that pay services are not essential and it’s only a matter of time before people think the service isn’t worth the money? “Why do people put up with it? ” I don’t It’s all lies anyway We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. No; it was accepted because there was no other choice. If you went to a movie theater, you’d see ads (some called “trailers” because they used to run after the movie, till the advertisers realized everyone was leaving without watching them; and since 1990 or so, there are also just regular paid ads). Books would often have ads for other books by the same author or publisher. Magazines and newspapers were full of advertising, and also abused their subscribers by selling their data to postal and telephone spammers. TV shows were only distributed on advertising-supported networks, whether or not you were paying a cable provider for them, and were never sold; same for radio shows. When networks like HBO and Showtime came around, a small number of people were willing to pay because there were shows they couldn’t get elsewhere; being ad-free was mostly a bonus. Some of the “premium” networks were themselves initially “bonuses” (or forced subscriptions, depending on your point of view) included with cable TV. Similarly for streaming services: they were sold on the basis of being convenient (lots of stuff to watch, no schedules), not being ad-free; and some, notably Amazon, were bundled with unrelated subscriptions. Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves But morale hasn’t got a chance of improving until streaming services are no longer enshittified, so I guess streaming TV is going to die.

Title: Trump’s Election Is Also a Win for Tech’s Right-Wing “Warrior Class”

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.” To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.” It’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.” This “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.” Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.” Thiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. “Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.” The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.” William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.” In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. “There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.” Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.” The American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.” A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.” This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters. “‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.” The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.” Matt Sledge Pam Bondi has replaced Matt Gaetz in Trump's attorney general slot.
