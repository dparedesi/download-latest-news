This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ian Carter, a 33-year-old job seeker in Redmond, Washington, who previously worked as a technical program manager at Microsoft. It has been edited for length and clarity. On May 13, I was getting lunch at a Panera Bread when I just happened to check my email. When I read it, it felt like a gut punch. I'd been laid off from my Microsoft job. My mind started racing. Could I have done something different? Could I have been better? However, I eventually realized it was simply a business decision. I'd seen the company lay off a lot of people in recent years, and it felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not — everybody was at risk. When I was laid off, I was on medical leave for a personal health issue and had been planning to return to work in the coming days. I collected my last paycheck in mid-July and then received some severance pay, but I started applying for jobs almost immediately. My mindset was "I can cry while I apply." I decided to share that I'd been laid off on LinkedIn, and the post received over 115,000 impressions. I began receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities, and I've landed interviews at companies that include Disney and Nintendo. But it's now been five months since my layoff, and I'm still looking for a job. I've been drawing on my savings to pay the bills and renting my one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month lease for about $2,700 — all while crossing my fingers that I land a role soon. My lease ends the week of October 20, and if I don't have a job offer by then, I'm planning to move across the country to Florida to live with my family and save money until I find a job. Rent is expensive, but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: If I had to guess why I, along with many others at Microsoft and other Big Tech companies, have been laid off in recent years, I'd point to two factors: overhiring during the pandemic and massive investments in AI. Whatever the reason, it's clear that finding a job in tech has become significantly more difficult. Before my layoff, I regularly heard from college students struggling to break into the industry. The market already seemed tougher than when I graduated — and now, I'm seeing that firsthand. I'm in a spot where I have nearly four years of full-time experience — not quite a new grad, but not senior level, either. I think some companies are looking for one or the other, which has made my search harder. Others are seeking very specific skill sets, while mine can sometimes be viewed as more generalist. As I've searched for work, I've been trying to develop my AI skills, as job postings suggest that companies are increasingly valuing this expertise. Working at Microsoft also gave me insight into the value of AI skills. During my last year, I didn't personally feel that my performance expectations had risen too much, but I did feel some pressure to find ways to incorporate AI into my work. During my job search, I've tried to replicate the strategies that got me to this point in my career. I dropped out of high school in 2009 for health-related reasons, but I eventually earned my GED and enrolled at a community college, where I earned my associate degree and then went on to attend Florida State University. During this period, I built my network on LinkedIn — I now have more than 8,700 followers — which helped me secure interviews and ultimately land an internship at Salesforce. A company recruiter reached out to me, which is how I learned about the role and landed an interview. Having the internship on my résumé helped me land full-time interviews after graduation. I had a list of dream companies — including Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix — and I applied to a program manager role at Microsoft without a referral. After an interview, I eventually received a job offer. In 2021, I graduated from Florida State with a bachelor's degree in computer science and began working remotely for Microsoft due to the pandemic. In 2022, I moved to Redmond, Washington — where the company is headquartered — and before I was laid off, I had a six-figure salary. As I've searched for work — targeting program manager, project manager, and product management roles — I've tried to rely on my existing network and make new connections. When I see a role that interests me, I reach out to the recruiter or someone with a similar job title at the company and ask what they think their company is looking for in a candidate. I then tailor my résumé accordingly. Since I have a LinkedIn Premium account, I have more visibility into who views my profile. If they have an interesting job title, I'll send them a message. Most of the time, they respond because they recall visiting my page, which leads to a conversation. When I connect with people, I usually ask for advice rather than a referral. But if someone offers to give me one, I gladly accept. While these connections have helped me land some interviews, I'm still looking for a job offer. Going forward, my plan is to continue doing what I'm doing — applying for jobs, networking as much as possible, and developing my AI skills. However, if my job search drags on, I might consider pursuing a graduate degree, such as an MBA or a degree related to AI. In addition to networking for job opportunities, I've also reached out to others who've been laid off to discuss our shared experiences. Layoffs take a mental toll, and it's nice to talk to people who can relate. I sometimes visit the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout the company's history. It's always interesting to read about what others are going through and their stories. It makes me feel like I'm not alone. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Let’s give the ‘fired’ label a rest
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/11/why-its-time-move-on-from-the-word-fired-restructuring-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-10-11T13:10:00Z
Full Content:
Here are some eye-opening numbers: Last year, nearly 20 million Americans got pink slips. By June of this year, 10 million employees had been dismissed from a range of industries and companies, including blue-chip tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as once secure federal agencies. A whopping 1.6 million workers are laid off each month. Losing your job is a perpetually looming threat: 40% of American workers report being terminated at least once in their careers; most of them were taken by surprise. Those numbers are just as bad — and often worse — for those at the top. Recruiters tell us an estimated 40%-60% of senior executives are forced out, in part due to today’s record high turnover of CEOs. Regardless of title or income, the same label is applied (and self-applied) to people who’ve lost their jobs: You’ve been “fired.” Words matter. And the word “fired” implies fault — your fault. While some employees are let go for performance or behavior, millions more are caught in restructurings, downsizings, and strategic shifts spurred by investor and marketplace pressures. This cuts across corporate America, whether you’re on the shop floor, in middle management, or in the C-suite. No one is immune. We live in a churn economy of routine mass layoffs and restructurings that didn’t plague the generations of workers who retired before the 1980s. Leanne’s parents collectively spent over 40 years at Boeing; Nina’s father spent 30 years at Hughes Aircraft. Our parents’ generation could count on stability, security, predictability — and profound corporate loyalty that cut both ways. One study found that 58% of Fortune 100 companies announced layoffs in 2023, while in 1979 only 5% did. Back then, being “fired” was shorthand for showing unproductive, ill-fitting, or unethical workers the door — preferably before they stole the stapler. There are still plenty of employees who earned their pink slip fair and square. Performance and integrity issues? That’s on them. We shouldn’t shy away from holding employees accountable. But in today’s turbulent economy, the vast majority of displaced workers aren’t fired because of personal failure. More than ever before in modern times, people’s careers are fragile, unpredictable, and subject to pressures beyond their control. The personal toll of job loss is enormous. We’ve been fortunate to work with some of the most exceptionally talented and visionary business leaders around. And even among these super achievers, a job loss shakes confidence and self-worth, threatening to erase in their own minds years of well-earned impact and success. “Executives know the exit isn’t really about them,” says executive coach Nicole Didda. “They’ve got the performance, the reviews, the credibility. Still, the word ‘fired’ hits hard. Especially for women, it undermines confidence, making them feel ‘less than’ even when they know better.” That damaging psychic weight of insecurity and self-blame seeps into our society and politics, where polls show a stubborn and longtime trend of declining faith in a better future. No wonder, when 81% of workers in 2025 fear job loss. With an unsettling sense that control has slipped away, there’s a tendency for even the most talented and accomplished employees to self-identify as “fired” — even when the cause of their dismissal is a slowdown in the market. Poking fun at oneself for being let go may build connection, but it also undermines confidence, credibility, and faith in a better future. These economic forces aren’t going to change, especially with AI bringing its own uncertainty and job disruption. All the more reason we need to reframe the narrative around job loss. If almost half the workforce has experienced a job elimination, shouldn’t we give the word “fired” a rest? Let’s be more thoughtful — and understanding — in the way we treat our colleagues (and ourselves) when describing workplace departures. Let’s replace “fired” with something like: “freed for what’s next.” Let’s make the increasingly frequent business of moving on less dramatic, and a whole lot more human.

Title: Germany news: Union group warns of 'major social conflict'

The center-left SPD, part of Germany's ruling coalition, says detaining failed asylum seekers indefinitely would be unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Germany is rolling out the EU's new Entry/Exit System. Follow DW for more. The Social Democrats (SPD) have censured a plan proposed by Germany's conservatives to detain rejected asylum seekers indefinitely, particularly when they have committed a crime or were deemed a security risk. Düsseldorf Airport is the first border entry point in Germany to introduce the EU's new Entry/Exit System for non-EU nationals. Germany's top trade unions have accused the government of hurting workers and warned employers not to make staff bear the cost of economic troubles. And while the far-right Alternative for Germany party retains the largest support among voters, the ruling coalition has seen a rise in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Below is a roundup of top headlines from Germany over the weekend of October 11 and 12: Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil said the government will re-examine a partial embargo on the supply of weapons to Israel. For more on Germany's policy toward arms exports to Israel, visit our Middle East blog. Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million ($116 million) to help in the reconstruction of Gaza, German Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan said Sunday. The exact amount is yet to be determined. Read more about Germany's pledge for the reconstruction of Gaza in DW's Middle East blog. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil is seeking a consensus among the leaders of the ruling coalition on the multi-billion-euro savings plan needed to balance the 2027 federal budget. Klingbeil also serves as vice chancellor. "We have already started this process," he said in an interview to broadcaster ARD on Sunday, adding that he hopes a package of measures will be ready around the turn of the year. The coalition intends to present a comprehensive package that would achieve about €34 billion ($39.5 billion) in savings, according to the minister, who leads the junior coalition partner Social Democrats (SPD). Klingbeil emphasized that the package must be seen as fair. He said the plan will likely focus on social services, long-term care, pensions and healthcare. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's governing coalition is led by his conservative CDU/CSU alliance. In August, Merz said that Germany's welfare state "can no longer be financed." German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday drew attention to the nearly 700 million people worldwide suffering from hunger. The United Nations has set the goal of a world without hunger by 2030 and, speaking at an event in Berlin marking Welthungerhilfe Week (World Hunger Aid Week), Steinmeier said: "We must not fail on the way there, despite all the setbacks that unfortunately exist." The aid week is an annual campaign organized in Germany by the humanitarian Welthungerhilfe (WHH) organization to raise awareness of global hunger. Ten years ago, the UN set the goal of a world without hunger for 2030, but this objective is unlikely to be met. According to a UN report published in July 2025, about 673 million people suffered from hunger last year, around 8% of the world's population. The report stated this was a slight decrease compared with 2023 (8.5%) and 2022 (8.7%). In his speech, Steinmeier pointed to the causes of hunger, citing wars and climate change. Steinmeier is a German politician who has served as Germany's president since 2017. Germany's president serves as the head of state, but the role is mainly ceremonial. Voters in the eastern German city of Frankfurt an der Oder chose an independent over the Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate on Sunday, blocking what would have been the far-right party's first urban win in a mayoral election. Axel Strasser won with 69.8% of the vote against AfD candidate Wilko Möller, according to preliminary results. Turnout was 49.4%. In the first round on September 21, Strasser received 32.4% of the vote and Möller 30.2%, while candidates from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SDP) were eliminated. Frankfurt an der Oder is in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, located directly on the border with Poland. It is distinct from Frankfurt am Main, the much larger financial hub in western Germany. Frankfurt an der Oder is the fourth-largest city in Brandenburg with around 57,000 residents. The AfD is classified as right-wing extremist by the Brandenburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Slightly fewer people attended this year's Cannstatter Wasen Volksfest in Stuttgart, with about 4.2 million visitors recorded over 17 days compared to 4.6 million last year, organizers said Sunday. The drop followed a record turnout in 2023. "We had a festival with less-than-ideal weather conditions," said Andreas Kroll, managing director of the in.Stuttgart events company. Despite the cool, variable weather conditions, he said the atmosphere remained positive and the safety plan worked well. On October 3 and again on Saturday, police briefly closed access to the grounds due to overcrowding. Police described the festival as largely peaceful, even though reported crimes rose by about 20% compared to last year. "We saw more offenses against emergency personnel but fewer thefts and property damage," said Jörg Schiebe of the Bad Cannstatt police. He added that while there was "a higher level of aggression," incidents remained low given the large crowds. The Cannstatter Volksfest is widely considered to be the second-largest beer celebration in the world after the Munich Oktoberfest. Police in northeastern Germany said they have received new leads into the disappearance of an 8-year-old boy who went missing two days ago. The youngster, who was identified by his first name, Fabian, went missing from the town of Güstrow in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Friday. According to the police, the boy had left his mother's house with permission, possibly to see his father, who lives in another town. He did not return afterward. A police spokeswoman told DPA news agency that they had received additional tip-offs overnight into Sunday, adding they were examining bus video footage among other potential evidence. "There is no indication of a crime," the spokeswoman said. Police planned to conduct further interviews in the boy's neighborhood on Sunday, having used sniffer dogs the previous day to trace the boy's steps. Güstrow, a town with a population of 30,000, is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Rostock. The European Union began the gradual rollout of a new border entry system for non-EU nationals, which could lead to longer processing times at border entry points. From Sunday, non-EU nationals will be required to register their biometric data, including fingerprints and facial images when entering the bloc. The so-called Entry/Exit System (EES) will be required once every three years. The rule doesn't affect EU nationals or those holding residence cards for member states. Amid concerns that the new process could lead to long delays at border checkpoints, several EU countries have opted for a phased roll-out. Germany, for example, will introduce the EES at the northwestern Dusseldorf Airport first, before the system is expanded to larger airports in Frankfurt and Munich and later to external sea borders. The EES is the first step in a new EU border system. In late 2026, a paid travel authorization is to become mandatory for non-EU nationals who do not require a visa. Germany's ruling coalition of CDU/CSU conservatives and left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) has seen a modest rebound in approval ratings, according to a new poll. Some 28% of respondents said they were satisfied with the government's performance, up five points from three weeks ago. Approval for Chancellor Friedrich Merz personally rose to 27%, a gain of four points. The poll was conducted by Insa this week for Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Even so, a majority (63%) of Germans surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the government and 62% disapproved of Merz himself. If a parliamentary election were held on Sunday, the governing coalition would collectively reach just 38%, short of a majority in parliament. The moderate conservative bloc would gain 24% of the vote, while the SPD would reach 14% The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) retains the largest single-party support at 26%. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have hit out at a proposal by their conservative coalition partners to reform deportation procedures for failed asylum seekers in Germany. The plan by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt would allow authorities to detain rejected asylum seekers for an unlimited period, especially those who have committed crimes or pose a threat to security. Dobrindt's proposal comes as the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, seeks to speed up deportations across the 27-member bloc. Andy Grote, the SPD's Interior Senator for the state of Hamburg, told Welt am Sonntag newspaper that "an indefinite detention without the prospect of actual deportation would undoubtedly be unconstitutional." The interior ministries of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Lower Saxony also raised constitutional concerns. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Grote, who is a spokesperson for all SPD-led state-level interior ministries, said the key to increasing the deportation rate would be found by simplifying rules on returning rejected asylum seekers to the EU state they first entered. Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that Dobrindt's proposal also includes the deportation of Syrian nationals whose asylum applications had been rejected. They would be banned from returning to Germany for social visits. The proposal was, however, backed by Siegried Lorek, Baden-Württemberg's State Secretary for Migration, who said: "When it comes to repatriation, we are particularly focused on repeat and intensive offenders, as well as those who pose a threat." Guten Morgen from the banks of the Rhine River in Bonn. Our blog will keep you updated on the latest developments in Germany over the weekend, including: We will also be offering in-depth analysis on selected topics of German politics and society. Several people were injured in a shooting in a marketplace in the town of Giessen in the state of Hesse in central Germany, according to reports. Read more about the incident here. Berlin police have launched an investigation after two cases of graffiti vandalism were reported early on Saturday in the city's government district. Around 6:50 a.m. (0450 UTC), officers discovered orange paint markings — including a circle with a dot and an overturned euro symbol — on a low wall outside a Bundestag office building on Unter den Linden. While police were documenting the damage, Bundestag security reported similar graffiti on a construction site banner near the Brandenburger Tor S-Bahn station. The State Security Division of Berlin's criminal police is leading the investigation into both incidents. A roughly 2,000-year-old Roman silver treasure has been revealed near Borsum in the Hildesheim district of northern Germany, the Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung has reported. According to the paper, a metal detectorist found the hoard in 2017 but kept it hidden for years before turning it over to police in April. Sebastian Messal, an archaeologist and regional director at the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation, said the discovery is of "enormous scientific importance." So far, about 450 silver coins, several silver bars, a gold ring and a gold coin have been recovered. The items are believed to date from the first century AD, Germany's DPA news agency said. Messal said the size of the hoard puts it "among the top five, perhaps top three, finds in Lower Saxony." Prosecutors in Hildesheim had opened an embezzlement investigation against the 31-year-old finder but later dropped the case due to the statute of limitations. The man said he initially hid the treasure at home out of fear of legal consequences. Archaeologists have since excavated the site and uncovered additional coins. Messal's team hopes the find will shed new light on life and trade in the Hildesheim region during the early Roman Empire. It remains unclear whether the treasure was buried by Romans or looted by Germanic tribes. Prosecutors are seeking a venue change for a possible new rape trial against the German man suspected in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The Braunschweig public prosecutor's office has asked the Federal Court of Justice to overturn the man's October 2024 acquittal and hold a new trial at the Göttingen regional court, spokesman Hans Christian Wolters told the DPA news agency. The goal, he said, is to ensure an impartial handling of the case. Last year, a Braunschweig court acquitted the 48-year-old of multiple sexual assaults in Portugal, citing insufficient evidence. Prosecutors have appealed the decision, and Germany's highest civil and criminal court is now reviewing it for legal errors. The defense has called the acquittal the only correct outcome. Prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison sentence with subsequent preventive detention. The Göttingen court has not previously been involved in the case. It remains unclear when the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig will issue a ruling. The man, a convicted sex offender, has drawn international attention because German investigators suspect him of involvement in the 2007 disappearance of three-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal. He has not been charged in that case and is presumed innocent. The 48-year-old was released from prison last month after serving a separate sentence for rape in Portugal.

Title: Intel slashes open-source contributions in the name of competiton

Intel has had a reputation for contributing to and benefiting from the open-source community, with contributions ranging from the RISC-V architecture to open-source Linux drivers for its Arc iGPUs and more recent gaming-grade dGPUs. It seems as though much of this will soon come to an end, though, according to Phoronix's reporting on recent comments from the company's Data Center Group executive vice president and general manager, Kevork Kechichian. According to Kechichian, Intel will seemingly no longer be contributing to open-source projects unless that contribution benefits Intel directly and "gives us a competitive edge against everyone else." "We need to find a balance where we use [our open-source software] as an advantage to Intel and not let everyone else take it and run with it." "We are very proud of our open-source contributions. We are going to keep on doing that. However, like I mentioned, I want to make sure that it gives us an edge against everyone else." –Kevork Kechichian (via Phoronix) Further comments by the Intel executive indicated that Intel may refrain from contributing to open-source projects altogether if it thinks that those contributions could help the competition. This announcement also follows Intel's July abandonment of Clear Linux, which was a performance-oriented Linux distribution that Intel had been developing for over 10 years. The new stance on open-source contributions runs counter to the generally accepted ethos of open-source, which is something akin to "a rising tide raises all ships," where everyone benefits from open-source contributions and there is a reciprocal relationship. With Intel's new strategy, it seems as though the company will be trying to use the open-source community as a resource to regain its lost competitive edge instead of contributing in good faith. The shift in Intel's open-source strategy appears to simply be the latest sign of the company's struggling to compete with both AMD and Nvidia, especially given the context of Kechichian's statements when it comes to Intel needing to ensure a competitive edge. Repeated setbacks, delays, and technical issues, both relating to CPU and GPU architecture and Intel's foundry efforts are exemplary of Intel's lack of competitive offerings, and this open-source shift appears to simply be the latest symptom of Intel's failings, even if Panther Lake shows some signs of improvement. The statements also follow Intel's recent layoffs that apparently affected maintainers of Intel's Linux kernel drivers. Intel's effective abandonment of open-source and the ethos behind open-source is further complicated by how much open-source code is used in many corporate projects, especially when it comes to AI projects. If you're on the market for a new SFF Linux gaming box, Intel might not be the best bet, so check out the likes of the Asus ROG Flow Z13 2-in-1 laptop — check out our review for more information — with an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (curr. $2,169.99 on Amazon).

Title: How AMD’s AI Software Helped It Score The Multi-Billion Dollar OpenAI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2025/10/09/amd-openai-chip-software/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T10:30:05Z

ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Whenever Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AI at the chip giant AMD, gives CEO Lisa Su an update on the progress of the company’s software efforts, she always has the same response: “Great job. You need to go faster.” It may seem unusual for a semiconductor company to put such an emphasis on software, but that’s what unlocks the power of the coveted chips that undergird the AI industry. They coax better performance from the silicon and optimize functionality. They allow engineers to operate and program the hardware. More importantly, they’re sticky: when engineers at a company learn how to use a chipmaker’s software platform, they can be hard pressed to learn another. According to Boppana, software is part of what helped AMD to score one of the biggest victories in its more than 50 year history: a multibillion dollar deal that will see ChatGPT maker OpenAI use AMD’s MI450 chips to power 6 gigawatts of compute for its popular AI products. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will be able to buy up to 160 million shares, or 10%, of AMD. The partnership is a massive boon for AMD as it tries to catch up to market leader Nvidia. The foundation of the deal dates back to 2023 when OpenAI first began running some of its models on AMD hardware. In the ensuing years, AMD would seek the AI giant’s counsel on the design of its forthcoming MI450 chips. OpenAI has also influenced AMD’s software, Boppana told Forbes. “As our relationship with OpenAI deepened, we've expanded the engagements across all portions of stack, but certainly on the software side,” said Boppana. For example, AMD worked with OpenAI to make Triton, OpenAI’s open-source language for programming GPUs, compatible with AMD chips. (Previously, it only supported Nvidia GPUs.) “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia.” The AMD-OpenAI deal comes as demand for compute power has become almost insatiable. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank announced Project Stargate, a $500 billion investment in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure. Apple made a similar $500 billion commitment weeks later. The AI frenzy has turned Nvidia, previously mostly known for gaming chips, into a $4.5 trillion behemoth. Late last month, OpenAI entered into a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia to power 10 gigawatts of compute. Meanwhile, a new generation of semiconductor startups, including Cerebras, SambaNova, Groq, and d-Matrix, have sought to develop specialized chips for the AI era, optimizing for those workloads instead of the more generalized approach favored by the legacy players. The explosion of AI services in the past few years means it won’t be winner-takes-all when it comes to compute power, said Sid Sheth, CEO of d-Matrix. “The opportunity is just so large, there’s no way OpenAI works only with Nvidia,” he told Forbes. “Customers are now willing to go through the process of learning what it takes to work with AMD’s software.” For Nvidia, software has long been seen by industry observers as a powerful tool to keep it entrenched in the market. CUDA, Nvidia’s programming software, for example, has created a formidable moat when it comes to training AI models. But when it comes to inference, or the computing it takes to actually run the models, the barrier is lower because it’s a less complicated process. And that’s what OpenAI plans to use the AMD chips for. “The moat is not as significant,” Sheth said. “The threshold of pain is coming down over time.” The sheer speed of the AI industry has also opened the door, Boppana argues. “If the world was kind of static and not evolving, and you just had lots of legacy software with the same architectures…then for sure, there is a big moat,” he said. But with AI, the pace of innovation is making the software to program chips easier to use. “On a forward-looking basis, I think it's going to be less and less important.” The OpenAI deal sees AMD now furlongs away from where it was in 2014 when Su took over. Back then, the company seemed to be on its last legs, with layoffs that nixed a quarter of the company and a stock price of around $2. (It’s stock is currently worth more than $235, with a market cap of $382 billion). AMD had missed the boat on mobile devices, and PC sales were lackluster. It was up to Su to preside over a turnaround and win data center business from hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. Now her goal is to make the company a true player in the next technological wave: artificial intelligence. “I think there’s another phase for AMD,” Su told Forbes in a 2023 cover story. “We had to prove that we were a good company. I think we’ve done that. Proving, again, that you’re great, and that you have a lasting legacy of what you’re contributing to the world, those are interesting problems for me.” If all goes well, the 6 gigawatt deployment could beget more such deals in the future. And becoming a go-to vendor for OpenAI might help to kickstart that new phase.

Title: This Is How the AI Bubble Bursts

Time Published: 2025-10-08T19:17:35Z

Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the tangle of AI deals among tech giants could be signs of dangerous overinvestment in the developing technology. They outline three ways the bubble could pop. Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Seoul on October 1 after agreeing to collaborate on OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project, This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, while Nvidia is investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also counts Microsoft as one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoft accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su has defended AMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expects there to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.” Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos called the current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned that “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reports estimate that AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalest notes that “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanova points out that after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreaking report from Apple suggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” A recent study from MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations considered had achieved zero return on investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently after telling Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy at McKinsey & Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbook reported that nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23% in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such as Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator, on AI startups and the mindboggling valuations of those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI is committed to investing $300 billion in computing power with Oracle over the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation has almost doubled from $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recent reporting by CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Another report says the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk have each raised concerns about the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model, provided a recent example of what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is not difficult to imagine a major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerful Washington Post op-ed, Bethany McLean poignantly recalls the overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” Yale Insights is produced by the Yale School of Management. © 2007-2025 Yale School of Management

Title: AI could wipe out 100 million US jobs – Bernie Sanders report

Artificial intelligence and automation technologies pose a threat to nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released on Monday by Senator Bernie Sanders. The report suggests the disruption will be widespread, affecting both white- and blue-collar professions. According to Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, AI and automation could replace 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants, and 89% of fast food workers. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” The warning contrasts with the stance of the Trump administration, which has championed American leadership in AI development, arguing that losing the technological race to China poses a national security threat. In an opinion piece for Fox News accompanying the report, Sanders questioned the motives behind these massive investments, noting that “some of the very wealthiest people in the world,” including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, are pouring hundreds of billions into the technology. He warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” Sanders argued that the technology is being leveraged primarily to increase corporate profits and concentrate wealth, citing executives who have announced significant investments in automation concurrently with mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The senator warned that workers in manufacturing, trucking, and taxi services face a particularly severe impact from the rapid advancement of self-driving projects by automakers and tech companies. He also expressed skepticism that their goal was to uplift the “60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck” and believes the true driver is because “investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially.” The trend is already underway, with corporate giants Amazon and Walmart having eliminated tens of thousands of positions as they intensify automation.

Title: The Tiny Teams Playbook
URL: https://www.latent.space/p/tiny
Time Published: 2025-10-08T12:50:32Z
Full Content:
We are back organizing AI Engineer Summit — this time focused on Coding Agents! Join us in NYC on Nov 20-22! At the dawn of the decade of agents, AI Engineers and Productivity Agents are combining to create highly efficient teams from the smallest startups to internal skunkworks/refounding moments at decacorns and publicly listed companies. I previously defined “Tiny Teams” aspirationally as “teams with more m in ARR than employees”, because efficiency is the ultimate governing force for intellectual (and capital) honesty, not quantity of tokens or money or lines of code spent vibe coding. It is also a backdoor into a speed discussion, because smaller teams generally move faster, and faster teams generally win. Inter-Human trust & I/O is the bottleneck. The Tiny Teams concept has resonated so strongly that it’s pretty clear it is the next major transition of the org chart as we go from level 2 to 3 AGI. If the AI Engineer was the single player game, Tiny Teams are the co-op multiplayer game1, capable of far more adaptability, resilience and “damage per second”. Not all players are human. The study of org design is as old as human civilization, but this is the first time knowledge work can be augmented, automated, and scaled on demand, and organizations that don’t reflect this reality have their head in the sand. For AIEWF I curated some of the best examples of Tiny Teams I could find and simply asked them to talk about how they run themselves. We are releasing the full playlist today (which you can find in YouTube and NotebookLM format): Seriously, bookmark the Tiny Teams NotebookLM! We’ll keep adding to this over time. Universal advice from 7 teams w/ 100 people & 200m ARR. manually summarized. Hiring Hire right or not at all: have to be excited about the candidate or it’s a no Work Trials: paid projects for 4days-3months to be sure it’s a good fit Product-Led Hiring: top customers who quit their jobs to join you Top of market salaries: 95th+ percentile salaries Small (<15) crew of senior generalists: much fewer juniors Culture & Value: keep a living culture deck and live it Low ego, high trust: trust = speed, ownership Independence, Grit & Resilience: ignore standard VC advice, persevere Radical transparency and accountability: wall of work, show & tells User focus: Work closely with users, celebrate them, delight in feedback Camaraderie, speed: Have fun, do retreats, avoid burnout Operations Almost no meetings: “deep focus” - building instead of talking about building AI Chief of Staff: automate research, marketing etc w/ Gumloop or Lindy AI Support: very well fleshed out at this point. e.g. see Parahelp and Railway Let Fires Burn: in order to prioritize on the 10% critically important Compound learning: Oleve phrases it “Don’t Learn It Twice” - build reusable templates and playbooks In Person: either have an office, or VERY frequent AirBnB hack weeks Tech and Product Simple, Boring Tech Stack: shell scripts over k8s, keep code modular. Simple Product: start from UI wrapper over one API call to a LLM. Feature Flags/Experimentation: one of Oleve’s core principles. Benchmarks: create top tier internal evals for LLMs/harnesses. Market them. (this section is being updated live - if you are reading this on email, this will be updated on the live blog on Latent.Space. We’re shipping this out so you can just watch the talks without our commentary, but of course we actually want to absorb the lessons using human attention. Come back in a few days.) Gamma is one of the top 25 consumer AI products in the world, serving 50 million users with a remarkably lean team of only 30 people. CEO Grant Lee attributes it to three pillars: generalists, player-coaches, and brand/culture of a “small tribe”. Gumloop was one of the inspirations for Tiny Teams with the stated goal to be a 10-person unicorn. CEO Max explains the extreme lengths he goes to to be super picky, from “product led hiring” to 4 day work trials all over the world. Full disclosure, I am an investor since the Stackblitz days, and we’ve done a podcast with Eric and Itamar, but the story of how Bolt kicked off the “AI Builder” category hitting $20m ARR in 60 days with 15 people is very compelling. CEO Eric says "Focusing on 10% of tasks often yields the majority of desired results, forcing clearer thinking." We previously did a lightning pod with Sid so we were somewhat familiar with the Oleve story, and, fun fact, since then, this tiny team has launched a THIRD multi million dollar product that will be announced soon. (Consumer product studios operate very stealthily out of necessity). Palantir’s philosophy informs this tiny team. Together.ai raised eyebrows as it is not “tiny”, but Hassan is classically a one man tiny team, and no stranger to the AIE stage. He now boasts 3m users with a small team. Vik is author of Marker and Surya, but there are many open source vision/pdf/OCR custom models and when I invested it wasn’t obvious how something like this could turn into a profitable company — 7 figure ARR with 7 people, serving tier 1 AI labs. Stretching out the “golden period” of startups where high trust and careful, deliberate hiring of senior generalists dominate is key - per Jeremy Howard. We think Evals are important, yes, but not enough teams create their own benchmarks to eval models and harnesses to improve their product… and market themselves. Every is “high-taste tester central” and just raised $2m from Reid Hoffman et al. Every’s head of AI Practice Alex Duffy talks about how they see benchmarks and launches AI Diplomacy. There are more Tiny Teams than just the ones we managed to feature of course. Cognition was until recently a team of 80 making well north of $100m, and we’ve been blessed to have Scott Wu come by to tell the story of Devin 1.0 and Devin 2.0. Clearly “Devin 3.0” will involve a VSCode Fork, as everyone, even Amazon, has to do in 2025. Stay tuned to Latent Space for more Tiny Teams…. So what would be the “Battle Royale” or “MMO” equivalents? Perhaps this is the next phase Noam is working on. ++ Good Post.
