Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, we have seen prices rise and the stock market fall. Then we saw tariff delays leading to stock market surges, even as a massive tariff was placed on Chinese imports. This was followed by framework trade deal agreements with assorted nations, dramatically lowered tariffs on China due to the beginning of bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and China, and a shipping container’s worth of general uncertainty and unease. Despite this, what is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise if they have not already, even if not so much as initially feared. That’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance experts to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Tariffs generally fall into two categories: Baseline and reciprocal. Each has a different strategic purpose for the levier, and impact on those levied. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government, though tentative deals with select nations (such as the United Kingdom) may soon bring those down for some global partners. Few elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. As for what goods are affected, Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business, says: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Shortly after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” To understand the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, it’s important to first define the broader context of trade in the United States. “The U.S. trades a lot and imports a lot,” says Sarada, Ph.D. and adjunct assistant professor of strategy at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. "Imports include raw building materials, electronics such as computers and phones, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, cars and car parts, clothing, footwear, fruit, tree nuts, coffee and so much more." Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, adds that because of this reliance on imports, plus the ways the tariffs have been imposed, he expects that "nearly everything will increase in price.” He goes on: “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. As the tariff landscape continues to fluctuate, so too will the retailers affected by this change, as will the timing of the impact on the larger consumer marketplace. For example, China was briefly levied with a formidable 145% tariff rate, which saw countless shipping containers full of thousands of dollars worth of goods simply stop their forward progress toward the American consumer. Lower-value shipments, such as those from Shein and Temu, also seemed poised to slow dramatically. That’s because the large volume of direct-to-consumer shipments from companies like these, worth less than $800, have, until now, been exempt from tariff fees. This was because of a rule known as the “de minimis exemption.” According to an official White House press release: “On average, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.” As of May 2, 2025, that exemption is no more, and even these smaller shipments were expected to be assessed with import fees. Along with that initial 145% tariff, it looked like shipments could cost the consumer more than double the expense expected at the time of the order. Now, with American tariffs on Chinese imports lowered to 30% for at least most of the summer, prices may stay more manageable than expected, these low-cost retailers are likely to retain a decent share of the American market. All that said, reduced tariffs on China and framework trade deals with trading partners around the globe are likely not enough to head off price increases in the short term and the lingering chance of recession. As an example, Walmart, still the world’s largest retailer, is planning to raise prices soon. While many products Walmart sells are produced domestically in the United States—including much of the food and grocery items the retail giant offers—its assortment of toys, electronics and other major sellers for the company are overwhelmingly made in China. Even the temporary 30% increase on tariffs will impact the prices Americans pay. While we saw some price increases in anticipation of the tariffs and some shortly after they hit, the majority of the price jumps will take place months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the early summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. Given how interconnected the American economy is to the global world beyond, the impact of tariffs will undoubtedly be felt across industries and continents, from financial markets to factories and beyond. From a purely domestic perspective, Sarada explains it like this: “Tariffs, the production of goods and services, prices, portfolio values, employment and salaries are all intertwined. Once there is volatility or uncertainty [due to] tariffs, then we can expect uncertainties across these different aspects of the economy. When there is uncertainty, a small fraction of economic agents, like some types of traders and fund managers, wealthy individuals and some entrepreneurs can seize the opportunity to shift resources quickly into markets that are dropping and then cash out when they rise.” Further, some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Sarada adds: “Most people respond to uncertainty in the economy by pulling back." And as for how soon this might occur, exactly “when people will start pulling back depends on what they experience—whether they start losing jobs, see portfolios fall in value for a sustained period or stop receiving wage increases or bonuses.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Title: From Redmond to Bengaluru: How Microsoft’s India-first AI agenda exported America’s future

By Amanda Bartolotta May 16, 2025 Microsoft has quietly filed notice with its home state of Washington that 2,000 jobs will be cut at its Redmond headquarters beginning July 13. The layoffs, according to the May 13 announcement, are part of a broader downsizing strategy to “reduce management layers.” There was no press conference. No apologies. Just a bureaucratic filing that confirmed what many American workers already suspected – that their jobs are no longer essential to the company they helped build. Yet lurking beneath the surface of this corporate downsizing is a sweeping corporate realignment with global and geopolitical implications. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! For while Microsoft is cutting thousands of jobs in the United States, the company is simultaneously executing its most aggressive expansion ever into a single foreign nation: India. From billion-dollar investments in AI infrastructure to skilling programs to government partnerships and cloud capacity, Microsoft is actively repositioning India, not the United States, as the centerpiece of its AI empire. How Microsoft is using AI to replace American labor and redirect investment overseas Globally, Microsoft is on pace to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on data centers to power its AI future. But that investment isn’t fueling jobs in America, it’s powering layoffs. Microsoft executives admitted at a recent JPMorgan conference that “AI is saving us hundreds of millions a year” by replacing human labor in customer support alone. But what the company won’t say publicly is this: The AI revolution they’re funding isn’t just about innovation, it’s about offshoring – about products and services being designed, deployed and expanded in India, funded by U.S. dollars and built using technologies born in America. The very business models pioneered in the United States are now being used to undercut the American workforce and hollow out the very economy that fuels Microsoft’s success and the bulk of its revenue. In 2024, Microsoft earned $124.70 billion from the United States, accounting for 50.87% of its total earnings. In contrast, India contributed just $2.74 billion, a mere 1.12%. Yet India is where the company is placing its biggest bets. How Microsoft turned its back on American workers This isn’t Microsoft’s first move in this direction. In 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees, nearly 5% of its global workforce, while quietly ramping up hiring overseas. In a company-wide email, CEO Satya Nadella tried to soften the blow: “While we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas.” Left unsaid was that these “strategic areas” were overwhelmingly outside the U.S. and largely excluded Americans. As U.S.-based engineers, project managers and customer service teams were handed pink slips, Microsoft expanded its international footprint with no such downsizing abroad. In fact, the company’s head of India and South Asia, Puneet Chandok, made it clear in a press interview that there would be no layoffs in India. AI empire: Made in India Just months earlier, Microsoft’s Nadella stood on stage in Bengaluru to announce the company’s largest-ever foreign investment, $3 billion to build out AI infrastructure in India. This includes expanding data centers, cloud capacity and an aggressive AI workforce training program that will “skill” 10 million people in India by 2030, 2.4 million of whom were already trained in the past year. The announcement, made with little fanfare in the United States, was the largest foreign investment Microsoft has made in more than a decade. “India is rapidly becoming a leader in AI innovation. … These investments in infrastructure and skilling … reaffirm our commitment to making India AI-first,” Nadella said during a press conference hosted by the Indian government. Microsoft’s president of India and South Asia, Puneet Chandok, added: “Today’s announcement strengthens our belief in India’s potential and our resolve to equip the country with the resources and future-ready skills needed to excel in the global marketplace.” Chandok extolled Microsoft’s “commitment to copiloting India on its journey to become an AI-first nation.” Microsoft’s partnership is with the IndiaAI Mission, the Indian government’s flagship program that explicitly aims to dominate global AI applications by attracting foreign capital, embedding Indian infrastructure into international systems and forging deep partnerships with U.S. tech giants like Microsoft. India: ‘the world’s leading nation’? India has made no secret of its ambition to become a global economic superpower by 2047, and Microsoft is helping make it happen. India’s strategy is straightforward: Attract foreign capital, embed Indian infrastructure into global systems and acquire leadership through international partnerships, not organic innovation. As scientist and international speaker Dr. Pratik Mungekar has plainly declared, “In the quest for global supremacy and recognition, India has set its sights on a momentous goal – to claim the mantle of the world’s leading nation by 2047.” While Microsoft openly fuels India’s ambitions abroad, in the U.S. the American-born company is selling a different narrative. In a January 2025 blog post titled “The Golden Opportunity for American AI,” Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith outlines what appears to be a patriotic call to action: Invest in U.S. infrastructure, protect American innovation and promote AI leadership on the world stage. Smith opens with praise for President Trump’s 2019 executive order on AI, which emphasized securing critical technologies and protecting America’s AI edge from strategic competitors like China. At first glance, the message appears aligned with U.S. interests and like a national strategy. In reality, it’s a veiled push for India. For while Smith invokes President Trump’s 2019 executive order emphasizing the importance of protecting America’s technological advantage in AI from “strategic competitors and adversarial nations,” just paragraphs later, the blog downplays these protections, calling instead for a race to “spread American AI to allies and friends” and urging U.S. policymakers to empower companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon to expand their global infrastructure with fewer regulatory constraints. While claiming to support American leadership, then, the real message is clear: Move fast, bypass red tape and expand overseas, especially to countries like India. What’s left out is the glaring contradiction. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others have already invested heavily in India, building cloud regions, establishing AI labs and embedding their technologies across India’s digital economy. These aren’t emerging opportunities, they’re established footholds. And now, under the guise of “exporting American AI,” Microsoft is lobbying Washington to support and accelerate that shift even further. Meanwhile, the supposed urgency of outpacing China is being used as a fear-based distraction. Smith’s “Golden Opportunity for American AI” blog warns that China is rapidly expanding its AI capabilities and building infrastructure in developing countries, using subsidies and strategic partnerships. But what it fails to acknowledge is that India has adopted a similar playbook, positioning itself not through organic innovation, but through foreign acquisition, talent funnels and massive foreign-backed infrastructure builds. India’s track record of intellectual property misuse, reverse engineering and tech transfer through partnerships has been well-documented. The U.S. Trade Representative has consistently placed India on its Priority Watch List, citing ongoing challenges in intellectual property enforcement and protection, highlighting in some reports issues like inadequate trade secret protection and the absence of specific civil or criminal laws addressing trade secret misappropriation in India. Indeed, in sectors like defense and aerospace, India has repeatedly used strategic partnerships to absorb, replicate and redeploy foreign technologies. These practices are not anomalies, they’re part of a documented pattern. Yet Microsoft, in its bid for global expansion, turns a blind eye, insists the U.S. must protect critical AI systems from “adversarial acquisition,” while doing exactly that. Conclusion: Act now, or America’s AI future will be ‘Made in India’ At a time when American workers are being laid off in record numbers and the very industries they built are slipping away, Microsoft has shown the world exactly where its loyalty lies – and it’s not with the country that gave it life. Behind polished blog posts and patriotic slogans lies a calculated shift: an offshoring blueprint disguised as innovation, fueled by U.S. dollars and aligned with a foreign nation that has openly vowed to outpace the West. This isn’t just a corporate betrayal, it’s a surrender of American leadership, a silent handover of the future to a geopolitical rival cloaked as an ally. Microsoft’s AI empire isn’t being built in Redmond, it’s being constructed in Bengaluru, brick by brick, as part of India’s grand strategy to dominate the global tech order by 2047. If Americans doesn’t recognize the cost of this betrayal soon, the “golden opportunity” won’t belong to them. It will have already been outsourced, packaged, exported and claimed by a country that was never meant to lead Americans’ future.

Gerrit Kazmaier on what AI can really do and the quest to make enterprise software suck less. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Gerrit Kazmaier, the new president of product and technology at Workday, an enterprise software company. Decoder listeners probably know the name Workday; a lot of companies use its platform for HR and finance management, which the suits have started bundling into a phrase they call “human capital management.” I invite you to have whatever feelings you want about that. Anyhow, if you’ve been applying to jobs lately, you have certainly run into Workday, and you are almost certainly frustrated with it. I mean, I’ll just say this from the jump: it’s rare that enterprise software executives come on this show, because it’s a guarantee that I will ask them why everyone hates enterprise software and what they’re doing to fix it. Workday is no exception; last year, Business Insider literally published an article titled “Everybody hates Workday.” Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Gerrit’s new on the job, maybe a little bit braver than most, and, to his credit, he came on the show and took the heat. We spent a lot of time talking about what enterprise software really is, what it does, and why it has a reputation for being so deeply frustrating for so many people. As you’ll hear, the heart of this conversation is a major tension that exists between software as just a tool to get some work done and the idea that using a software tool is actually a job. And everyone experiences software like Workday in totally different ways across a company. I mean, just think about it: for most people in a company, Workday is mostly just a database, a series of forms they’re required to fill out to file expenses or log a performance review. For people who actually work in HR and finance, using Workday is actually their job. And then the C-suite, which makes a lot of decisions using data generated by tools like Workday, might never actually use the software at all, instead just looking at reports other people generate from it. You will not be totally surprised to hear that Gerrit’s solution to a lot of these issues is to use AI — after all, Workday now calls itself an “AI platform.” So I really wanted to know what Gerrit thinks about what role AI is going to play in workplace software and if letting AI fill out all those forms for people might make things better — or just result in bad data everywhere. And I really wanted to know how comfortable he was letting AI make decisions about finance and HR, because AI systems can have lots of bias built into them. That’s something lots of companies, including Workday, have already faced lawsuits over. Look, I told you there’s a reason enterprise software executives don’t come on this show often. So hats off to Gerrit for hanging in there — I think you’ll like this one. Okay: Gerrit Kazmaier, Workday’s president of product and technology. Here we go. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Gerrit Kazmaier, you’re the president of product and technology at Workday. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you for having me, Nilay. Excited to be here. I’m excited to talk to you for a variety of reasons. One, enterprise software executives don’t often want to come on the show because I just ask them about the nature of enterprise software, so you’re very brave. Thank you for coming on. And then second, you’re the new guy. You just started in March, so you don’t have to defend all the stuff that other people did. You can just be honest about it. Exactly. And hey, maybe you just don’t invite so many enterprise executives. So I don’t know. Maybe I can lure some more in. My threat is always that we’ll just use the software together live, but it’s an audio podcast, so don’t worry. We’re not going to do that today. Workday is one of those pieces of software that maybe everybody encounters in the course of their career. You apply to a job, Workday is the interface; you’re at a job, it’s your finance system. It’s “human capital management” — I think that’s what we call it now, when you’re doing your performance reviews. How do you think about Workday? What is this thing? So it’s this incredible system that helps organizations on the one side manage their people and manage their money, which is great. Well, two of the most important assets our corporation is built upon. But I think more importantly, like what you have said, right, when you think about everyday work experience, it’s the systems that everyone touches, everyone interacts with, and I think makes a huge difference in having a great work experience and ultimately great personal development and building a great career. So yeah, it’s a system of work and it’s very exciting to be here. There’s a lot of companies that want to describe themselves as the backbone of how you might do work. We had web service companies come on, Squarespace come on, and say we’re the operating system for small businesses. You book the class or you book the auto mechanic and then we’ll do the billing and finance. Workday is also expressed like that in some way, right? You’ve got people, you’ve got money, they’re moving through your system, they’re spending the money. You’re tracking what the people are doing and if they’re performing well. Do you want the big picture of, We’re running the entire business in Workday? You know, it’s funny, right, because I think that’s kind of an archaic way to think about systems and people altogether because actually enterprise software is an ecosystem. Organizations are large and touch many domains and people and money is important, but there is also customer, right? There is service. There are so many things, right? There are so many things that makes a company and there’s so many things that make a work experience that I’d argue that back in the old days, when you look into the, I don’t know, the legacy enterprise software systems, that they had this idea of that perfectly walled garden, and Hey, there’s going to be one door you enter in the morning and you’re going to stay in that door and we are going to give you what that system has to offer, and that’s it, right? And I think today’s reality is that it is not reflective of what makes a great enterprise software stack. You have a multitude of vendors offering different capabilities and you have to compose them together to reflect what really is important to your company. Secondly, I think it’s about the work experience, from people bringing their own devices today, now bringing in their own AI models, more often than not their own AI coding experiences, meaning that they also have way more agency about the systems they use and the systems they expect to use, right? So you have collaboration and productivity and that’s something very specialized and you have enterprise systems for all sorts of purposes, and I actually think it’s about an intelligent ecosystem and being part of — I would describe it as an enterprise software fabric, if you will, where it is really important that vendors like Workday work with other vendors in the industry and build that system so that customers can use them in orchestration without having that kind of ridiculous idea, right? “Oh, you get everything from one [vendor] and you have to be happy with that.” I mean, how would that work? I mean, you have a long career in enterprise software, but that is a trend across every enterprise business product that I’ve ever encountered, where you start with one part of the business and then the line everyone uses: We want to be the operating system for your business. We want to take everything. And it sounds like you’re just totally against that. I think I’m totally for a vibrant software ecosystem, and if you think about it, it starts with an operating system. I think that’s a great metaphor, but it’s also something that I think we have to evolve, right? Back in the old days when we said “operating system,” it was this monolithic piece and everything had to run on it. And then came along the web and suddenly, well, what you had on your operating system was not the only thing that you could use because when you were on your device you could access web services and online services, too. So when we say “operating system,” what is the operating system? You might say, “Well, it’s a specific software platform and only the things that run on it are allowed,” right? And I would say, “Well, I guess the operating system today is the browser and everything which relies on HTTP as part of my operating system ecosystem.” And in the AI world you might say it’s an operating system that is defined by MCP, or model context protocol, and we have an orchestration of agents. So I do think operating systems are important because they actually define how an ecosystem works. They define standards and they define very important shared interests, security being one of them. So those are all things that no one would want to give up on, but I don’t think they’re single-source, single-vendor, monolithic pieces anymore that just create one experience. I think I would say it’s a dated way of thinking about enterprise software, actually. There’s a real push and pull here and there’s a reason I’m starting in this kind of esoteric space. I think a lot about what work is, like what are we all doing? And in the age where there’s a big push and pull between remote work and in-office work and what those experiences are, so much of our jobs just every day is using software. You and I are talking right now through a piece of software called Riverside that is quite cranky, but on one very basic level, my job is just using Riverside a few times a week. The things I can do at my job are limited in some ways by Riverside, but they’re enabled in huge ways by the software existing. You see that with every kind of enterprise software, right? There are enormous numbers of HR and finance professionals who show up to work every day, and what they do is they use Workday in one way or another. There’s executives who receive reports from Workday and their job is just evaluating the information Workday has compiled for them and then making some decisions based on it. How do you see the role of the software there? Because what it looks like and how it works and what it’s for is all pretty dependent on the fact that some people’s jobs are just using the software. It’s an interesting way to think about a job, right? Because when you said, “It’s my job to use Riverside,” I actually thought maybe that’s not true. Maybe your job is asking powerful questions and talking to many people and creating a show that engages listeners. Riverside, the software piece that you have just mentioned, is just something that allows you to do your job really well, right? I think the same applies when we think about Workday. People have important jobs to do. They try to hire great candidates. Once they hire great candidates, they try to onboard them and train them in the way a company works. They want to build thriving organizations that let people have a really good work experience. They want to manage performance, and they want to reward and recognize people. Those are the jobs on the HR side. On the finance side, it’s as simple, right? You ship products, you want to write bills, and you have to pay bills, and you want to create a compliant profit-and-loss statement and you want to be financially responsible and viable in the long term and manage your cash position and so forth. And those are the jobs, right? Now, basically the question is what do you have available in terms of tools and software that allows you to do a job in the best possible way? That’s the core of Workday, right? Workday says that for the jobs that you have, which are software independent, which are emergent from the very core thing that you do as your value creation, we are going to give you the best services and products to everything related to people and money. I think that’s a very important focus to get this straight because sometimes I do think people get confused, specifically in technology. AI is a wonderful example of that, by the way. Because now some people think maybe the job is AI. Maybe that’s my job, to do something with AI, and there is a certain thrill and excitement that goes with that. But ultimately, there is a reason that when you look at studies… for instance, Stanford has that AI Index Report, and it’s a beautiful 400-page read on the state of AI, and part of that survey is that enterprise leaders get asked about their returns on the AI investment and the vast majority said AI gave them less than 5 percent top-line increase and less than 5 percent bottom-line efficiency. You wonder with all of that investment, how can that be? And I think ultimately it’s because there is a confusion that some people think, “Maybe that my job is AI,” but actually it’s not. The job is what you’re trying to do for your business, and AI may be a powerful way for you to do this job better, and for software vendors like Workday, it’s the same. How can we help people manage their money and people better through AI and being focused on the real job versus on the technical means that facilitates a certain way of doing that job? I saw a similar survey from IBM where they surveyed CEOs and the results were only 25 percent of the AI projects had returned on the investment. So we’re in this place where everyone’s spending the money, you guys are spending the money on AI — we’re going to talk about that — and no one knows why. I’m sure you have an answer. But I see that piece. Then there’s the other piece of AI. The reason people are investing so much money in it is because maybe the AI can use the software or maybe the AI will fill out the forms or, and this is the big promise, the AI will do the boring stuff. Workday, I think a lot of people have expressed, is the boring stuff in their job, right? They’re filling out expense reports or whatever. You have all the way up to agentic AI, which is actually doing stuff and making decisions. How do you see that interaction? Is AI going to use more and more of Workday for people? First of all, I would say Workday is the exciting stuff, so. [Laughs] You have to. I appreciate that you have to say that Workday is the exciting stuff. Because I think sometimes when we say, “What’s the exciting stuff?” I actually think... Well, like you said, I worked in enterprise software my entire career, but actually all of the enterprise software businesses that I was a part of, they’re people businesses 100 percent, right? You drive all of your work through and with people and teams. So managing that and growing and managing people, that’s an exciting part of the job and Workday is that system in which you make that happen. So this is why I’m saying it’s the exciting stuff — for me, Workday is more than doing a PTO request. But can I ask you about this? Yeah, of course. Managing people is the exciting part of the job, sure. As somebody who manages people, there are days I agree, there are days I disagree. I don’t think about this software as the management, right? And maybe it’s just that I work in a creative field and our conversations about management are very different, but there’s not a place where I’m like, “I’m going to use this software and that will accomplish a management task.” It’s much more like, “I’ve accomplished the management tasks and now I need to record it in this software just so I remember what happened.” But there’s a confusion there, right? I think whether or not what happens in the database is real life is maybe the central confusion of the entire tech industry across the board. It might be the central confusion at the highest levels of our government right now, but how do you see Workday closing that gap, if at all? Is it even possible to close that gap? I totally think it’s possible to close this gap. I see us having closed that gap and increasingly closed that gap in certain domains. But I completely agree with you, right? Work is so complex and it happens in so many ways, and it’s not, like I said earlier, it’s not that it’s all happening in one system only. It’s an ecosystem. So I completely agree with that point, and some of the work is even offline. Like you said, it’s talking to someone. As simple as that. But there are domains, for instance, like in the recruiting space. How do I build recruiting campaigns? How do I interview people? When I interview people, how do I select candidates that are best fit for the job on something more profound than pedigree, but skills, and skills that they have shown or skills that I can infer? Those are actions. This is work where work genuinely happens to a significant degree in a system like Workday. So it may not be happening everywhere, I agree with that, and maybe it shouldn’t even happen for everything everywhere. But there is a significant portion where professionals actually do their job in these systems and that’s why I think it’s so important to get them right. I haven’t had to use Workday in a long time, so to prepare for this interview, I watched a lot of Workday training videos on YouTube. Amazing ecosystem of Workday training videos on YouTube, I have to say. It just occurred to me as I was watching some of this stuff that Workday is expressed to people as a database very openly. It’s a database or maybe a spreadsheet in some of the other interfaces, and people applying to a job experience it as a series of forms to be filled out. Again, when I say, “You use the software to accomplish the task,” a lot of the task is making sure the database has the right information in it. That runs sort of headlong into AI, right? Now you’ve got people using AI to generate the information for the database or you’ve got an AI system that’s going to look at a receipt and figure out what it is and put it in the right fields. That’s a new kind of data risk there, where you’re definitely going to get all the fields filled in. If there’s one thing generative AI can do, it’s fill in the fields with little effort, but it might be hallucinations. It might be garbage. It might be worse than if a human didn’t fill out the field at all. How are you thinking about that risk? I think what you’re describing is a question of maturity, actually, of maturity in both ways, both technology and use. AI is undeniably the most profound change in technology, and I think we are just living through the beginning of a renaissance of what AI can deliver. In any domain — material, science, medicine, and enterprise software being just one of them — people are solving problems in incredible ways with the use of AI. As a person, between you and I, humankind has big challenges, very big challenges, and I think it’s a wonderful opportunity to have broken one of these big technology boundaries on reasoning and judgment and knowledge compression and being able to use that on virtually any domain that exists. So I think that is incredible. But what you just spoke about is the flip side of that, right? It’s new, and the reality is that we have intuitions about it. We have an intuition that a computer program is right because it’s deterministic, so there is an intuition that goes alongside using a computer. When you talk to a person, that is different because we know that we have biases, we get stuff wrong, and there’s a different type of intuition that we have than what we expect a computer program to do. Now we have these generative AI models and like you have said, they’re probabilistic. They’re not deterministic in many ways, and even very subtle things change their behavior and things that we wouldn’t expect them to do. It was just I think last week or the week before, this outcry of the latest OpenAI model, and I think it was called the sycophancy of it. Yeah. It was too nice. Yeah. [Laughs] Because it was too nice, and it was actually a few small changes that dramatically changed the behavior of the model, making it too nice and not really helpful anymore. So what you just spoke about, when we think about AI specifically in an enterprise context, I think the big point is that AI gets you to a lot of results really quickly. It’s so powerful, but in many ways it is really shallow. In the enterprise space, for instance, we take one of these very powerful models, we give it a really good prompt that is reflective of a business problem, and the model gives us something and it looks roughly good and we say, “Oh, yeah. We got it solved.” We are happy about that. But the reality is then you actually want to make it work with accuracy expectations that you need to have in order to be used in a professional context, or that someone makes mission-critical decisions upon. Or in cases, and this is very important, where someone cannot correct the model in a direct way. Coding is a good example. Why is coding successful? The model gives you something back in a modality that you understand as a coder, right? You know what the model is doing. You see the code. You have a chance to lean in. That’s why it took off so quickly there. Because you basically spoke the same language with the model and that was a big corrective. And in an enterprise system, like what you have said, you have to fill out this complex form for maybe a process that you don’t even fully understand yourself. And it has language that is legal and compliant that is alien to you, and the model’s doing something [on its own]. How do you know? That is actually the big difference. I guess I would be a little more reductive. I would describe the problem here as garbage in, garbage out, right? The promise of so much enterprise software, particularly HR finance software, is if you just had more information, you would get better decisions. If everyone would just fill out all of the fields, if only everybody would just fill out the software correctly, we would have better perfect real-time information about the business and then we would make better decisions. What AI is doing, maybe not built into Workday but just in general, is that now people with a ChatGPT app on their phone can definitely fill out all of the fields, 100 percent. You already see it in job applications. People are applying to a thousand times more jobs than they were before because they can just fire a copy into these job applications from ChatGPT, and now the systems are overwhelmed with irrelevant information. So you’ve got garbage in. What on Earth? Like, how do you solve this problem in the context of having to turn that into actionable information? Yeah, I think it’s two points. And I do want to go back quickly to what I would describe as the challenge of shallow enterprise IP before we get to what you just said about how we cope with the new behaviors that are emergent with the use of AI. I would actually challenge what you said. Models get it wrong a lot, specifically when you talk about something that is not in the public domain. So we have public knowledge, and models are extremely good at compressing this knowledge. They’re terrific. Who would’ve thought? I think everyone was surprised in 2022 when [chat bots] really broke through and how powerful the technology would become with actually a very simplistic mathematical model. That’s the mind-boggling insight. The math is simple. It’s just applied at volume and it produces these incredible results. But you now have these Ph.D.-level models coming into an enterprise context and showing up for the first day at work. They know nothing about the intricacies of an enterprise, the proprietary data. You spoke about a database. There is nothing represented in the knowledge base of that model. And yes, some of it is emergent, meaning that without really being trained with it, they are reasonably good at doing something with it. But the bigger point being is they get it wrong a lot. So one side, when you ask what Workday is doing, it’s actually taking these models and making them do something valuable in an enterprise context. Just something as simple and it connects to what you just spoke about, making sure you are selecting the right candidates for a job. That is a non-trivial task because you need to understand job requirements, behaviors, and job applications. You need to basically train and specialize a model — and not only a model, actually, a system and a set of models — to do that with high accuracy. Contracts are in many cases using language, terms, and have implications which again are not existing in a public domain. So you have to train a model to basically understand enterprise contracts and apply them in a system like Workday. So I think that’s big. Right now, I’m in San Francisco. We have autonomous cars driving around here. I think that’s an important insight, right? For something to be used in a mission-critical domain, it needs to work all the time. An autonomous car is not viable if it only works 99 percent. Would you use it? I wouldn’t use it. It needs to work 100 percent of the time. There’s a lot of Tesla owners out there who have made a different decision than you. I’m not even going there, right? I know a trick question when I hear it, so I’m not even going there. But for it to work it needs to work 100 percent of the time, and doing this in an enterprise context is heavy lifting. The second thing you said is that of course with AI, behavior changes in helpful and in unhelpful ways. I use AI a lot to do research, and it’s awesome because I have all of this intelligence on tap, and it’s also being used in unhelpful ways, like you’ve said, for creating content spam and unhelpful data signals, which overflow systems. The good thing, though, is that there is always a balance, right? There’s a constant balance between misuse, abuse, and protection. So what is the antidote to what you have just described? It’s that if bots generate applications or forge expense lines and try to trick the expense system, you use AI models to also counter that. As it turns out, AI models are terrific in spotting patterns that are generated versus done from a human. I’m sure you have filled out a CAPTCHA request online in your life, a couple, right? So the same idea. You basically build protection using AI to make sure you’re not being missed or abused by AI. I think that’s all the same meta theme of increasing maturity and using AI systems and working with AI actors both inside and outside of a company. I want to ask you Decoder questions and I want to try to put all this together. You’ve only been at Workday a few months. You probably know where the bathrooms are in the office, I’m hoping, by now. You’ve met all the people. What are you thinking about how your team, the product org, is structured and how you want to change it? That’s an interesting question because you’re actually kind of trying to lead a witness here. Like, “How do you imagine you would change that?” I’m not sure if I am. So Workday is a young company. Workday is 20 years old. Compare this with many other enterprise software companies that are twice as old or even older, right? So Workday has a really strong technology foundation. Actually, what surprised me the most when I got into Workday is how good its technology foundation is. I joined from a cloud provider. I worked at Google for the past four years before I joined Workday. So you come back to the enterprise application domain of certain anticipations and Workday really is incredible when it comes to its tech stack, its scalability, its elasticity. I mean, it was a cloud-first system from the get-go, so it really has a great foundation to stand on. When I think about evolving as going to the future, it pretty much aligns with what you have said. It’s maturing enterprise systems around the use of AI. My take is the following: Today you see a lot of bolt-on AI, meaning you see a lot of legacy systems and they just get an AI overlay, and you see integration vendors deal with all of this complexity, and now AI comes to the scene and they say, “Well, let’s just slap AI over it and we call it automation.” I just want to go back to autonomous cars. If you have AI, the opportunity is to purposefully build with AI to change how a job is done. Where we started actually gets completely innovated and revolutionized. For instance, when we think about something like job applications, something very natural, we all have an understanding. We all applied for jobs. I’m not sure if you did, actually, but I did in my life and I think it resonates. Wait, when you got the job at Workday, did you have to apply in Workday? No, I did not. It’s a good question. No, I did not actually. But Workday is not my first job, right? I was a [junior employee] once, and I put an application into a system and then through the interviewing process. The big opportunity that we have by really innovating in Workday is now taking agentic AI models and not just driving API automation of an old process that was defined by, if you will, human constraints to a new way of doing it with the heavy use of AI. For instance, tailored onboarding experiences, tailored experiences for job applicants and targeting who we approach and how are they feeling for that. You just said, “Why does it matter how I apply to a job, right? I just fill out a form.” But there are industries, for instance, where you have high numbers of frontline workers in retail and hospitality where you have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of applicants a year, and for them actually signing up for a shift or basically joining a company is something that is either frictionless and you can do it through an intelligent experience — including your skill assessment on your mobile phone with a conversation — or you have to log on to a classical web application and fill out forms. I mean, which one would you use? I think there are real opportunities of how we can really change the way these processes are done from what it used to be, which is human- and document-driven, to proactive and AI-led. When you think about those opportunities and how your team is organized, how do you map those things together? How’s your team actually structured? How is Workday structured? We have an AI team today, which is, again, I think a testament to Workday being a young company and being very forward-leaning when it comes to AI. So there is a great AI organization that is part of my product organization, which is basically driving the Workday ML and AI platform. Many of the great things that we are doing in the recruiting space and the contract intelligence space like self-service and agent system of record, this is all being driven by that group. As I’ve indicated, this is one of the key innovation pillars that we have. We have our application domains, right? We have our office of the CHRO, office of finance, our industries, and those are application teams which are basically building on our technology foundation, the AI foundation, our application server, and building the systems that you and I and any listener on this podcast would recognize and say, “Oh that’s Workday,” right. That’s the UI and the workflows around it. And then there’s an infrastructure team, as you would imagine, which is basically running our deployments into the various cloud providers. I mean we are running on AWS and we are running on Google Cloud, and as you can imagine,, this is infrastructure and a pipeline that also needs to be built and maintained. Those in a nutshell are the groups: AI, our applications from HR, finance and industries, and our infrastructure team. Right before you joined, Workday had some big layoffs. I think 1,750 people were let go. Obviously those weren’t your decisions. As you came into the company, did you think, “Oh, I need to hire up,” or was one of the justifications for those cuts that you need to invest more in AI? Tell me about that balance. Did you see, “Okay, we need fewer engineers because the ones we have are using a bunch of AI tools,” or did you see, “We actually need to go hire a bunch of AI engineers?” You’re asking me a question about a time when I wasn’t at Workday, so I can’t really speak to the thinking that went into that decision. I can see, judging from the 60 days or almost 70 days now into my role, that we are actually investing in AI. We are investing across our application suite. I think in a bigger picture, like you have said, yes, the work of software engineering is changing with the use of AI and with the application of AI, meaning that we built skills inside of Workday to effectively use AI and we are hiring for people that bring that expertise into the company, so on both ends. I wouldn’t think, though, that this is in any way different or special from what the overall industry is doing. I mean, we’ve seen so many companies, including companies we have interviewed on the show like Duolingo, say, “Okay, we’re all in on AI. We’re through the testing and experimentation phase. The way we’re running this company is now formally changing because of AI and we expect AI to appear in all the things we do.” Are you all the way there? Yeah, we are making — I hope as any professional software company out there — heavy use of code assistance and wipe coding. And I’ve started my career in software engineering myself, but I was a hands-on developer for many years, and just seeing how much it helps and changes the quality and the results you drive on the software engineering side is amazing. With wipe coding, actually, I think what it drives on the product management side is amazing, that you can actually specify working prototypes and real interactions. It’s not just Figma anymore or a [Product Requirements Document], which is great, right? Because you give so much more fidelity to your ideas. So yes, we make heavy use of that and I truly believe it delivers real returns. Foremost because when I was a developer, I made a fair amount of bugs, meaning introducing issues in the programs that you’ve written. I hope that every software developer out there has the same moral integrity to say, “Bugs happen.” What I saw, and what convinced me the most about assisted coding, is that actually, most of the bugs that you create are in hindsight like, “Yeah, I should have really got that. I just didn’t think the following conditions through.” AI helps in two ways. One is it’s so good at test-case generation that you just have way better verification. And secondly, the assisted coding generates high-quality code, really not making many of the typical mistakes and anti-patterns that you just make as you’re developing from a junior to a very senior software engineer. So we use all of that. That’s super exciting. And yes, Workday has a very powerful concept. It’s called Everyday AI. It was the second thing that surprised me about Workday. And man, Nilay, you’re asking me these questions. I’m not trying to make an advertisement for Workday here, but you’re just asking for it. Workday has this program, Everyday AI, and then when I joined the company, we were having an offsite just in week two, and it was basically a review of Everyday AI, and I was so amazed about how broadly Workday is applying AI. I have talked to so many companies in my past that came to me in my previous role and said, “Well, how do we use AI? What are the use cases? What works?” Then I came to Workday, ranging from employee self-service to contract intelligence in legal, basically both front and back office are making heavy use of AI models, AI applications, and AI systems. I think it was a very smart decision of the company to say, “Let’s experiment very broadly in every function. Let’s find what really delivers value and then quickly double down on those scenarios.” And so I think that Workday is incredibly mature when it comes to applying AI for itself. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is how do you make decisions? What’s your framework? My framework to make decisions? I believe in understanding the details. I think you can ask the question in another way: why do decisions go wrong in the first place? First of all, I think you have to recognize that there is a certain element of uncertainty in every decision that anyone makes. Meaning you can make a really good decision and you can have a bad outcome and you can make a horrible decision and you just get lucky. And that’s the nature of the uncertainty, if you will, of the future, depending on what your belief system is. But I think it’s hard to predict the future and there is always an element of chance and probability. So I think that’s something we have to recognize about it, and that tells us something. That tells us that the one thing I can influence in decision-making actually is having a really robust process that on average, if you will, or in a great end count, produces significantly more good outcomes than bad outcomes. So I’m basically trying to address the uncertainty by having a very robust framework and process to get to a high-quality decision process because I know that statistically that will drive to high-quality decisions in outcome, but you can’t make all of them right. My decision process follows, I think, a simple framework. One is trying to mitigate, as much as possible, human bias. We all have them. They’re so human. It’s funny that I say it that way. There’s so much ingrained in our nature. There is this great book I think by Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow, I’m sure you’ve come across it — that talks about all of the biases that we have and how our brain functions, and there are just some typical repeat patterns. For instance, that we have loss aversion. We think about losses more significantly than potential wins. If I give you $10 and if I then take it away again, you’re not at the same level of happiness as you were. You are unhappy. I made you unhappy, right? Even though you’re exactly the same as when you started, it’s just the loss feels heavier and it biases decision-making. There is a bias in preferences, right? There’s so many things that you can address by, one, having a very structured a decision-making process, going through all of the alternatives, listing them out, writing them down, actually being explicit about them and thinking with pen and paper, if you will, because it helps you to bust all of these biases that you have. And then second of all, in the decision-making process, actually engaging the right set of people to come to an unbiased decision itself, with the right balance of expertise. And thirdly, I think understanding the details matter. The abstractions are helpful, yes, and there is a certain element where it is not adding value anymore to go even deeper. We would all agree you don’t need to understand quantum mechanics to know how to throw a ball, that there are helpful abstractions. But in decision-making on leadership and on businesses, you really do want to go to the right level of detail to truly understand the dynamics of what’s going on. And then there’s being time-bound, right? My father has this great saying that is with me a lot, and he says, “You need to have the courage to take the second-best solution.” And what he means with that is that the most and fiercest competitor that we have in life is status quo. Most of the time we are not taking a decision one way or another. Most of the time we simply decide to not decide and analyze more. Let’s find even more data. Let’s kick the can down the road because you are of the idea that if you just give it more time, you will come to a better solution. And the problem with that is that you are actually passing the point where progress is more important than one percent more accuracy in the decision that you take. So if you put those four things together, having a really good decision framework that goes against or insulates you from your own biases. Secondly, having the right mixture of experts around you to make sure you are really having the key voices representative. Thirdly, understanding the details so you can make an informed decision, and then when the clock runs out, you go. You need to have the courage for the second-best solution sometimes. Let’s put this into practice. Workday, like all enterprise software, suffers from a disconnect between the customer and the user. You see this in every enterprise. Every piece of enterprise software has this problem. It’s CIOs and CEOs and COOs who buy this stuff and there are employees who use it, and that means there’s not a great feedback loop between the experiences of the people using the software and the people who are spending money on it, and that means the software is all bad. Like, broadly. We don’t use Workday here, we use UKG Pro. I think UKG Pro is bad. I’ll just name all your competitors down the line. The users think the software is bad. Workday has a particular reputation here. Business Insider literally published a piece in 2024 called “Everyone hates Workday” and the quotes are brutal. Here’s one from an AI company, a copy director at an AI company. The quote is, “Using Workday is like constantly being botsmacked by bureaucracy incarnate. Getting somebody onboarded, using Workday is like trying to get water from your sink to your stove using a colander.” That’s bad. Using a what? Using a colander, like a strainer. Okay. You’re trying to carry water with a bucket with holes in it. You see this everywhere. The interface as expressed is bad. People do not like using the software. There’s another quote from that same piece: “Everything is so non-intuitive. Even the simplest tasks leave me scratching my head.” There’s one that says, “I just hate the software.” Great. That’s every piece of enterprise software. But Workday in particular has this headline, this reputation. You can see it on Reddit. You can see it in the comments of the training videos I was watching on YouTube. How do you fix that problem? I think a part of that is really understanding what you just articulated. As I said, understand the details, right? Understand, truly, the details to make sure you are making good decisions specifically about what you invest time in and what you think generates value for the users of Workday? So when we say, “Understand the details,” I think it’s really important in enterprise software to go through the workflows in detail and sometimes for yourself, sometimes by observation, sometimes by interview, and really have firsthand experience about what it is that people do and how does it feel and what makes it good and what can be improved upon it. I think to your point, it sounds so benign, but you said let’s apply this framework, right? The framework simply states that, “Well, do you understand the problem really when someone is saying this is great or someone is saying this is bad? What do they truly mean?” Because we all have our biases, right? For instance, one big bias is you seek validation, right? You seek validation for what you believe to be true, and you overemphasize on signals that reinforce that. The first step is really going to the right level of detail and understanding what it is at the action level that drives satisfaction or dissatisfaction in a piece of your application experience. Once you have that, once you understand that, it turns out that usually the framework becomes almost obvious to say, “Well, this is something that ideally should be different,” or, “This is something that actually works the way it’s supposed to.” It’s just not communicated. It’s miscommunicated, right? You are holding it wrong. That’s quite a quote. Yeah, that category exists, believe it or not. Or thirdly, “Hey, actually we have different ways or different expectations now of how you can use that.” For instance, when you talk about system interactions, right, the reality is that it’s a dynamic environment. I have two kids. They have different expectations of using a system than what I had. I grew up with forms, that was computer stuff, right? How cool is that? That’s amazing. My daughter is mobile-first and, dare I say now, AI-first, and she’s just eight years old. So that’s the amazing part of it, a different intuition. So when I say Workday and AI specifically, it’s now, “Hey, how can we make this conversational?“ or, “How can we make it so you don’t even have to specify some of this information anymore?” Like you said, I have to take information from here to there. Why is this complex? Why do you even have to? Is an AI model maybe proficient, and can we make it proficient so it just automates that? This is why I wanted to start with talking about what the software actually is. When I see a quote that says, “This software is bureaucracy incarnate,” what I imagine that means is a bunch of people at a company had a bunch of priorities and they all got expressed in a form. Everybody wants another piece of data from whatever process is happening and we’re just going to put another field in the form and then everyone can get their data, and that’s your “bureaucracy incarnate,” right? We’re literally shipping the org chart in the nature of this process. Okay, so now we’re going to say AI is going to fix it. We’re going to fill in all the forms as fast as possible just by talking, and all the forms get filled out, and then that looks like a risk. Like there you have exactly the risk. Maybe the AI is just going to say 20 percent nicer things because the model’s wrong because ChatGPT 4.0 got a little too nice one day. Maybe it’s just going to make some stuff up because it thinks that’s what you want to hear. Maybe it’s going to mishear the person. I hear a lot from a lot of companies that AI is the new user interface, all the way down to Eddy Cue on the stand in the Google trial yesterday, who said maybe 10 years from now you won’t even have an iPhone because AI will have replaced it all. That’s where we are as an industry. And then I look at this very simple problem for a lot of people filling out a database on Workday. Filling out the database for the AI might mean the database is full of bad information, but no one else has solved the problem in any other way. I think it really connects to where we started, the whole question of what drives value with AI. I fundamentally believe with AI, as with any other technology, you can apply it superficially or you can apply it in an excellent way. And applying AI in an excellent way actually means getting AI to differentiated levels of accuracy and outcomes. We talked about autonomous cars and you said some work and some don’t, right? So there’s clearly a difference, right? Even though you could all say, “Well, I’m sure they make all use of AI somewhere somehow to do processing and trajectory projection and so forth.” And that’s exactly what we are focusing on with Workday, because some of the information, like you have said, is important information, right? Guess what? You want to pay people. You want to have internal mobility. We have, in companies, in many companies today, a shortage of qualified labor for the work that they want to get done, and they have people sometimes inside the company who could do it or even people outside of the company that they could activate for doing it, just to pick a very simple example. And now the question is, what can you do by excellently applying AI to really revolutionize and improve these journeys? And there are clearly ways to do that. I was just speaking about recruiting, but you can help recruiters make better decisions. They don’t have to fill in the form anymore. They don’t have to make the assessment. The model helps them to identify the right candidate for the greater good of everyone. Well, let me ask you about that. You inherit literally the biases of the models, right? You inherit literally the capabilities of the model. Right now there’s a lawsuit against Workday saying that the tools are biased against workers and applicants, particularly Black workers and applicants over the age of 40. That might be the problem in the model, that might be the problem in how you’ve expressed the model, it might just be how people are using the model. But now you’re saying you’re going to help make these decisions and you have this liability. How do you fix that? First of all, I cannot possibly comment on any ongoing lawsuit, but in general– But the lawsuit exists, right? You know it exists. This is the problem in depending on the AI. The AI might make errors of this magnitude. I will give you Gerrit’s opinion. So because again, and you know this, if you want to have commentary on the ongoing case, you have to talk to the right person for it. That’s not who I am. But I can speak to you in general about AI. I think AI actually helps us to become unbiased, and the same principle applies, right? You can apply AI very poorly, and it’s a question of maturity. Since the course of the existence of machine learning, people learn that if you have the wrong training data and you’re lacking guardrails, the model just expresses what was given [to] the model during its training phase. Basically, you define it by the act of creating it. And as you move from immature AI to excellent AI, when we understand the representation of data, the guardrails that we have to put around it, I think all of these biases, as you described — that humans are susceptible too, just in a different way. But humans have emotions, humans have irrational elements to them. We are not computers. And that is what makes humans great, but it also makes us, in many cases, poor decision-makers. But the AIs… the corpus of their training material is biased human information. Yeah, exactly. How do you take that and then turn that into a thing that unbiases us? Especially in these contexts. I mean, Amazon had to stop using AI screening tools that were imposing bias into their hiring process. Can you measure it? Can you say, “Okay, we’re good enough”? You do it by getting the recipe right, meaning you’re getting the training recipe right, you’re getting the guardrails right, and I think this is the important intersectionally that in order to get AI right, you have to look at it holistically. You have to understand the domain. You have to understand what is the judgment that a model applies. You have to understand what training data you need to provide for it, and you need to provide the guardrails that you have to basically put as checks and balances around it so it stays in its defined parameters. Once you do that — and that’s the power of AI and machine learning models — they will consistently work at the same level of quality, but it’s the responsibility to create that system around it. I think — again, my opinion — if you do that, it works in an incredibly powerful way. Let’s just go back to something we all experience in San Francisco every day: autonomous cars. That’s a great example, because so many things can go wrong, and now we are at the stage where they work reliably. And the lesson is, if you design a system the right way, if you think about it holistically, you can actually make it work all the time, better than a human driver would, because we also have human limitations that we don’t want passed on. What is every good recruiting team doing? What is every good performance review team doing at the beginning of a review session? Let’s unbias ourselves, right? Let’s talk about them so we free ourselves from that being applied. And there are teams that are good at it. There are teams that are not as good at it. But if you codify it in a system, you can basically have the best-possible decision-making on tap every day, and that’s the power of it. Tekedra Mawakana, the CEO of Waymo, has been on the show, and the thing that struck me was that it’s true, it does work great in San Francisco, I think in Austin and Phoenix now, too. It’s rolling out. All warm weather cities. I asked her, “Will this thing work in Denver?” And she was like, “No, no, no, no, no. Too hilly. Too snowy. Can’t do it.” That’s what I mean. We’ve designed systems in very narrow domains under essentially perfect conditions that we trust, and then you make it more complex and then it’s just like no, we can’t do it yet. Maybe we’ll get there one day, but we can’t do it yet. I think you’re completely right, and that’s exactly what I mean. You make it work by narrowing the domain. It’s incredibly hard to make a car work everywhere. It’s incredibly difficult to make a general AI that works on everything. And again, that’s the Workday recipe. Our claim is not that we are going to make an artificial general intelligence that solves any problem. We do exactly what you said. It’s narrowing down the domain to something that we really understand, that we understand perfectly, and let’s design a system that basically solves that part of the enterprise ecosystem. When you think about the complaints people have for Workday today, I want to ask you two different questions. One, what are the top five ones that you want to fix? People do not like using this software. How would you fix it for them today? That seems to be a really important point for you, Nilay. As I said, you were brave. This is why enterprise executives don’t come on the show, because that’s honestly what the listeners want me to ask. How are you going to fix my problems today? It’s not just feature requests, it’s the holistic experience of using enterprise software that is bad. How would you fix it today? I think my conviction… down to the bones of my body if you will, I’m a product person. I love well-designed products and I seek them out for myself and I aspire to build them. I think when we say about building a product — and I was talking earlier like, are you holding it the right way? — beautiful design is how it works. It’s not just how it looks. Design is how it works in everyday use, from a coffee machine to an enterprise software system, and I think the recipe is for all of them the same. Recognizing that this is a big deal. This is not something that just falls off at the end. That’s something you have to carefully research, design, and invest for to make it work. And then secondly, when you asked me about my decision-making process, really understanding those details, what works well and what doesn’t. If something doesn’t work well, what’s the best way to improve it and to make a tangible improvement for the ones who are articulating the need for improvement. I believe honestly in a relentless pursuit of the basics. When we say excellence, how do you get excellence in anything? I think it’s to recognize the importance every day. Secondly, apply the discipline rigorously every morning, every afternoon before you go to bed. And if you do this consistently enough over a period of time, you will see huge differences. The problem with all of these things is you cannot go from here to there in a step function, change from here to tomorrow, right? Because actually what you’re saying is, “How do you achieve excellence in something which is non-trivial?” And as I said, first of all, it’s fully believing in its value, otherwise you won’t have the strength to see it through, and then secondly, applying the basics of that discipline every single day, rigorously, and over a period of time, and you will see amazing returns. I said I was going to ask this question two ways, so here’s the second way. Do you use Workday at Workday? Yes, we’re using Workday at Workday. What are the five things that bother you most about using Workday at your job? Can I tell you what the biggest surprise was, first of all, when I came to Workday? I have used Workday before. Sure. [Laughs] The Workday at Workday looks so different. [Laughs] I mean, this is one of the issues, right, because your customers deploy it differently. Exactly. And I was coming into Workday and I said, “I’m surprised,” because the system that I have just used for everything, from entire onboarding, from benefits enrollment, to corporate credit card, to learning my team, to any sort of approvals, to org review, I’ve done it all in Workday. Everything, and it is so different. And so I said “Explain this to me.” Because honestly, in my previous Workday experience, I had struggled with a couple of things here. This is different. And I was told basically what you said: “Yeah, it’s a real issue that we have customers who configure and deploy the system and are not updating the system to any of the improvements we have done over the recent past.” So when you asked what I wanted to change immediately? I want to go on a campaign and actually make sure that the quality of the experience — and I’m not saying there is nothing to be improved anymore — but the many, many things that I have experienced firsthand myself are 10 times better from what I personally have seen before. Making sure that all of this flows for the users. What are some of those things? Be specific. Search. Find me my form for requesting a credit card, searching “credit card,” and getting the form loaded and populated with the right fields already, because, guess what, you know my name, right? There is no surprise here. And my employee ID and all of that. And just making me basically select the credit card example, what is the limit, and if I want express delivery and send. Something like that. So search experience, one terrific example, or the assistant experience, one of the workflows that people most do commonly is request personal time off. In Workday Everywhere, you can do this by using Slack or Teams, right, with a chatbot. So I bet many of the things that you were quoting are people trying to do something that to them looks very simplistic: “I just want to know my PTO balance and put in a request. Why do we even have to log on to that system?” So that’s what I mean when I talk about a difference in expectations, that you just expect it to happen in your collaboration suite. Well, with Workday Everywhere, that works and I was surprised. Before you ask, I didn’t request PTO in my first 60 days, but I was trying it out, okay, because I wanted to know, because I believe in understanding the details. So as said, one of the things I want to do first is making sure all of this flows through to everyone because I think there is so much goodness that people are not yet getting. You’re hinting at something here, and this’ll be the last question because it’s just a big idea that I keep coming back to in all these conversations about AI and software and how we use it, that eventually the interface will just be natural language, right? There’s the small step you’re talking about, which is to go to the customers and help them deploy Workday more beautifully and make it make more sense for people and use all the tools. And then there’s the big one, which is you’re just going to talk to it and it’s going to do some stuff. How far away do you think we are from that? I think there are a whole lot of tasks where people use forms to approximate conversations where conversation is clearly a better paradigm, like a self-service type of request. Like I said, PTO and PTO balance. This is more like a self-service scenario where I can easily specify and it’s automating that and conversation is a good way of exposing it. And there are some others that fall in the same category, but turns out there are many that are not. So like I said, how many things can you remember in a conversation, off top of your head? Probably seven concepts max at a time. There are some application domains where you have a way more complex context and state models right there. Just something as simplistically as could you design a 3D scene without seeing it just through conversation? Of course not. Would you want to specify verbally that you want to select an element in the fourth layer? Probably not, right? It’s way too complex. Pointing and clicking is way more efficient. So I argue the case that conversational models will be a key part of what everyday experience is for a certain set of problems that just very nicely fit into it, and there is a larger set of problems, they are the state model, and the contexts are so dense that you cannot possibly conceive them in a conversational thread because it’s just overlaying what you can memorize in your brain. So I think it’s going to be on both ends, but I think every scenario where you’re going to ask something — “Can you do this for me? Can you find that information for me?” — it’s more simplistic in terms of the information retrieval, which is a great example of that, by the way. I think that’s going to be completely replaced with a conversational interface because why not? Essentially you have a request-response paradigm with some refinement in the middle for which a conversation turns out to be the best way of facilitating that. One of the reasons I asked this question is because my favorite Slack room at our company is called “finance-support,” and it’s staffed mostly by bots, and the people who are new to it come in and they ask very nice questions in full sentences, and the people who use it every day just shout nouns into the void. I’m looking at it right now — it just says, there’s someone who just says, “Extra April expenses.” One person literally just typed the word “credit card,” and then entered into an entire flow with this bot. It’s basically a command line and we’ve just recapitulated the command line with a more conversational interface where people have realized that the keywords will just do the job. Is that where we’re headed? We’re just doing command line? I don’t think so, but I do think what you’re describing actually is a good thing. I heard that OpenAI is using a lot of inference cycles because people are just being polite to the model, saying “thank you” and “please.” But the model’s going to work for that. So what you’re describing I think is just an amazing efficiency that people understand, “Hey, I don’t have to write a fully specified sentence of punctuation. I can just keyword it in and the system is going to do it for me.” And I think it’s because for some of the work this is just very efficient. Like are you really typing a full URL in your browser and writing it full out? I don’t. I rely on autocomplete and search to do the job for me. That’s a perfectly fine way of accomplishing the job. But I do think, like I’ve said, there are a certain set of problems like information retrieval and simple workflows where this is just a very nice way of doing it. That command line is good for a reason, to your point. An intelligent command line is very powerful. But there’s a bigger set of tasks and jobs where you wouldn’t use a command line. You need to see what you’re dealing with. You have many elements that are in relationship with each other. Just take something as simplistic as a contract in finance, because you just said finance, and you have a context with multiple payment terms that are dependent on each other. So you do need to see those pieces and how they interact with each other to make sense out of them. And AI is going to help you in identifying them and telling you, “This is a red line in a contract that you have to pay attention to. This is a payment term that you may want to leverage.” But if you want to modify that contract, if you want to rearrange it, you want to see the piece that you’re working with, right? You have this across so many domains that I think AI is going to change UI, and we have UIs that are designed with AI in mind. Today, some vendors are telling you you’re going to have a chatbot and a workflow engine and that’s going to be great, and that’s a good story to tell because we have all of this stuff built and having a chatbot over it doesn’t hurt, for sure, but it’s not going to change how you run as a company. It’s not going to be a transformative outcome for you. But if you design applications with AI collaboration in mind from the get-go — payroll, benefit selection, if you want to elect your benefits, you may want to see options. You may want to have multiple options compared to each other. There are going to be things where we can decide whether we’re going to render UIs into chatbots or render AI next to UIs, but it’s not going to lose those elements of interactivity where you just need to break beyond textual input and output. Gerrit, I feel like we could talk about the future of AI and how it changes workplace interface forever. I have to say, by the way, thank you. It is true — not many enterprise executives are brave enough to come on the show and answer the questions. So I appreciate it. Thank you so much for being on Decoder. Thank you for having me, Nilay.

Title: Media CEO Pay Packages in 2024: The Air Up There
URL: https://variety.com/lists/media-ceo-salaries-compensation-pay-packages-2024/
Time Published: 2025-05-15T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Top execs kept raking in the bucks last year, even as many of the companies they led struggled to stay aloft The entertainment business has seen better days. Film and TV production in the U.S. rose 18% last year but lagged 2022 levels, according to ProPro, which tracks studio productions. Theatrical ticket sales fell 3.3% in 2024 and remain nearly 25% down from pre-pandemic levels. Media conglomerates are spinning off cable channels at a dizzying rate, an acknowledgment of the damage that streaming has done to that cash cow. And tech giants like Amazon and Apple, which elbowed into the content business a few years ago, have found that it’s much harder to make a show that people care about than it is to sell them paper towels and iPhones. Cutbacks and layoffs are the order of the day. Yet for some reason the spirit of economizing didn’t extend to the executive suites. Seven of the 10 CEOs and media barons whose pay packages we examine as part of our annual survey of compensation got raises. And in most cases, the bumps were double-digit ones even though their results were often lackluster at best. “When the stock is up, CEOs always take credit, but when it plunges, they rarely take responsibility,” says Charles Elson of the University of Delaware’s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “There should be more alignment between pay packages and performance so when there’s a bad year, the CEOs take more of a hit.” To be fair, some of these executives will end up banking far less than what’s reported. That’s because the stock awards and options represent fair value as of the grant date and do not reflect actual dollar amounts received by executives. If the company’s value shrinks, so does their compensation. Of course, if it increases, their windfall could be even greater than it initially appeared in public filings. The pay packages may be largely undiminished, but our list of top executives shrank. Paramount Global hoped to have finalized its sale to Skydance Media by now, but the Trump administration and the president’s lawsuit against “60 Minutes” appears to be holding up regulatory approval. Still, Bob Bakish, who left Paramount amid the company’s deal talks with Skydance, has already profited handsomely, earning $87 million last year, which includes $69.3 million in severance. Then there’s Endeavor, which went private again after four years as a publicly traded company. Ari Emanuel, the brash agent who led the company’s whipsaw transformation, got a $173.8 million cash payout from the equity he converted to cash as part of the go-private deal (while also rolling his ownership interests with a total value of $290.3 million into the newly private company, Endeavor Group Holdings). Paramount Global will likely soon have company, as most industry observers expect that other media companies are looking for buyers (speculation often centers on Warner Bros. Discovery, which has endured two traumatic mergers over the past seven years and formally separated its TV business from its studio and streaming operations). Experts like Elson say companies often have good reasons for selling themselves or acquiring each other. But he also notes that there’s often a strong financial incentive for the people at the top to make these kinds of deals. “The synergies that come with a merger can be quite helpful, but you have to make sure the cost savings are really there,” he says. “Sometimes these deals are more ego driven and turn out to be disasters.” Historically, media chieftains are far better compensated than leaders in other industries. Much of that has to do with the ownership structure of entertainment conglomerates such as Comcast and Fox, which have dual-class stock. That gives the families behind them much tighter control, enabling them to reward themselves without risking much interference from average shareholders. This, in turn, skews the pay packages of media companies like Disney and Netflix, which aren’t run by families but justify rewarding their executives with big bonuses and options because they are part of the same peer group. It helps that the boards of these companies are often loaded with sympathetic allies. “Board members themselves are well paid,” says Rosanna Landis Weaver of shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. “It’s a very cushy gig. And no board member ever got asked to leave for saying, ‘Let’s pay the CEO more.’” Running a media company requires a very particular set of skills. A successful CEO must be the public face of a corporation — telegenic, amiable, able to work a room — and also serve as an ambassador to Wall Street at a time when investors have grown more skeptical about the long-term health of the entertainment business. Just look how difficult it was for Bob Chapek, the short-lived CEO of Disney, whose tenure was so rocky that the company reenlisted Bob Iger, the man he succeeded, as his replacement. But if media conglomerates rationalize giving their leaders extravagant pay packages because they’re worried that another company is going to poach them or that they will leave of their own volition, they should probably think again. “The thing about the media business is that these jobs are fun,” says David L. Yermack, professor of finance at NYU. “You get to have a lot of influence on society, and shaping culture is interesting work. Running a coal mine or being in the utilities business isn’t anywhere near as interesting.” Bob Iger, CEO2024 compensation: $41.4M/+31%Median employee compensation: $55,111Iger pay ratio to median employee: 746 How do you determine a job well done? When it came to Iger’s $7.2 million bonus, Disney’s board gave him credit for releasing “Deadpool & Wolverine,” which the family-friendly brand enthused was “the highest grossing R-rated film ever,” as well as for presiding over the best-attended D23 event in history and leading a company dubbed one of America’s most trusted by no less an authority than Newsweek. It’s hardly an empirical assessment, but Iger did have a successful 2024, one that saw the studio topping its rivals at the box office and releasing streaming hits like “Shōgun.” For Iger’s efforts, his relatively modest $1 million salary got augmented by more than $30 million in stock options and awards, as well as $523,685 in personal air travel and $1.4 million in security. It pays to rule the Magic Kingdom. Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $61.9M/+24.3% Greg Peters, Co-CEO2024 compensation: $60.3M/+50.2% Median employee compensation: $215,503Sarandos/Peters pay ratio to median employee: 287/280 Bingeing has been very good to Netflix’s co-leaders. Last year, the company targeted $40 million in total compensation apiece. Both got more than 50% of that, thanks to the streamer’s stellar performance. The company ended 2024 with 301.6 million subscribers (up 16%) and generated operating income of more than $10 billion. The stock soared 89% for the year, dispelling any doubts about the unusual two-in-a-box leadership structure. For 2024, Sarandos and Peters each received a $12 million cash bonus plus stock valued at $42.7 million, with Netflix’s compensation committee citing “our outstanding relative stock price performance compared to constituents of the S&P 500.” Meanwhile, co-founder and chairman Reed Hastings’ pay package dropped to $1.75 million last year (from $11.3 million in 2023). Don’t pass the hat for Hastings — he owned 4.23 million Netflix shares as of early April. David Zaslav, CEO and president2024 compensation: $51.9M/+4.4%Median employee compensation: $130,316Zaslav pay ratio to median employee: 398 Few would point to the marriage of Warner Bros. and Discovery and declare it a glittering success. The media conglomerate’s market cap hovers at $22 billion, roughly half of where it stood in 2022 when the companies joined forces. Like many entertainment giants, Warner Bros. Discovery has struggled to manage the contraction of the theatrical movie business and the collapse of cable, its primary source of revenue. Yet Zaslav, the main architect of the merger, is still rewarded handsomely. His $51.9 million compensation package includes a $23.9 million bonus (more than 100% of the target amount), as well as a $3 million base salary, another $23 million in stock awards, a $17,446 car allowance and 250 hours of personal flight time each year on the corporate jet. Brian Roberts, CEO and chairman2024 compensation: $33.9M/-4.5% Michael Cavanagh, President2024 compensation: $28.25M/-4.5% Median employee compensation: $89,237Roberts pay ratio to median employee: 380 Roberts and chief lieutenant Cavanagh got big bonuses last year — just not as fat as they were in 2023. Comcast grew on the top and bottom lines in 2024, while free cash flow (a component used to determine executive compensation) declined 3.8% to $12.5 billion. The board’s compensation committee determined that the company’s top execs were entitled to cash bonuses equivalent to 109% of target. But both Roberts and Cavanagh “requested that they not receive more than 100% of their target bonuses,” according to Comcast’s proxy filing, settling for $7.5 million. In discussing their performance, the company cited the plan led by the pair to spin off NBCUniversal’s cable TV networks (excluding Bravo) and complementary digital assets. The new public company, Versant, is set to separate from its parent by the end of 2025. Lachlan Murdoch, CEO and executive chair2024 compensation: $23.8M/+9.3% Rupert Murdoch, Chairman emeritus2024 compensation: $21.2M/-7.7% Median employee compensation: $89,068Lachlan Murdoch pay ratio to median employee: 267 Rupert Murdoch, 94, officially retired in November 2023. But the TV news, sports and entertainment company he built continued to pay him generously. As chairman emeritus, he had a compensation package totaling $21.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 2024, which included $8.6 million worth of stock and options and a $2.3 million bonus “following 71 years of service to the company,” per Fox Corp.’s annual proxy filing. Eldest son Lachlan Murdoch, who now runs the media empire, saw his pay climb 9.3% largely thanks to a $6 million cash bonus (versus $4.5 million in fiscal 2023) based on “quantitative” and “qualitative” performance factors evaluated by the board. “Fox once again delivered strong operational and financial results in fiscal 2024,” the company said in its proxy filing, including Fox News ending the period as the No. 1 cable network among total viewers for the eighth straight year. Tim Cook, CEO2024 compensation: $74.6M/+18%Median employee compensation: $114,738Cook pay ratio to median employee: 650 After docking Cook’s stock incentives in 2023, Apple determined that it wasn’t paying him enough. Based on an analysis of CEO compensation at “peer companies” including Amazon, Disney and Netflix, the tech giant boosted the target value of Cook’s equity award for fiscal 2024 from $40 million to $50 million. Cook’s stock grants were calculated to be worth $58 million. To be sure, the tech giant kept minting money: Apple revenue hit a record $391 billion (up 2%) for the fiscal year ended September 2024, while net income declined 3% to (only!) $93.7 billion. Of note: Apple’s services biz, which includes the App Store and Apple TV+, generated $96 billion for the year, up nearly 13%. In justifying Cook’s enlarged stock grant, the board’s compensation committee cited “the impact his leadership has on the company’s short-term and long-term success.” Andy Jassy, CEO2024 compensation: $1.6M/+17.6%Median employee compensation: $37,181Jassy pay ratio to median employee: 43 Don’t be fooled: Jassy earns more for running the e-commerce mega-company than the number listed for his 2024 compensation on Amazon’s proxy statement. As reported under SEC rules, the CEO was paid $1.6 million last year. But the bulk of Jassy’s remuneration is in stock awards that vest over several years (which Amazon reported as compensation for 2021). According to Amazon, Jassy’s 2024 “realized compensation” increased by 37%, to $40.1 million, due to the company’s stock price gains. That came after his realized comp decreased by 12% in 2023. In his April 10 annual letter to shareholders, Jassy touted the company’s growing entertainment lineup, including originals like “Reacher,” “Fallout,” “The Boys” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” and live sports like the NFL’s “Thursday Night Football” — with the NBA and Nascar coming later this year.

Amazon layoffs: E-commerce giant Amazon is cutting around 100 jobs in its devices and services division, which includers workers involved with the Alexa voice assistance and e-reader product Kindle, according to a report by Bloomberg. This moves comes as the company makes effort to “trim” its corporate workforce, it added. In a statement on May 14, Kristy Schmidt, spokeswoman for Amazon confirmed the layoffs and said that it is a part of the company's effort to “operate more efficiently” “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product road map, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions,” Schmidt added. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has begun the Seattle-based online retailer’s biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts. And as many as 27,000 workers were given the pink slip. Since then, several smaller rounds of layoffs in particular departments have led to job cuts across the company's various department, including some cuts in the communication division in January 2025. Till March 2025, Amazon had 1.56 million workers — the number include those on the rolls in full-time and part-time jobs. This is up 3 per cent comapred to 2024. However, the e-commerce giant’s workforce is mostly made up of hourly wage earners or logistics employees in its warehouse and delivery network. The job cuts at Amazon’s devices team were reported earlier by Reuters. This development comes after Microsoft Corporation on May 13 (Tuesday) also confirmed that it is cutting 6,000 jobs across departments in a bid to “reduce management layers”, the BB report added.

Amazon reportedly cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. The layoffs amount to a small portion of the unit’s total workforce, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 14), citing a company spokesperson. “As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” the spokesperson said, according to the report. Amazon’s devices and services unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox robotaxi, the report said. The spokesperson did not say which divisions saw layoffs, it added. Bloomberg also reported on the job cuts Wednesday, noting that Amazon has made several rounds of layoffs targeting specific departments and the company has about 1.56 million full– and part-time employees. In January, Amazon laid off dozens of people in its communications department. A company spokesperson said at the time that the changes were made after a review “to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and brings teams closer to customers.” It was reported at the time that Amazon has cut tens of thousands of corporate jobs since Andy Jassy became the company’s CEO in 2021. These include 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles. When announcing in January 2023 that Amazon planned to lay off more than 18,000 workers, Jassy said the economy was uncertain, the company had hired rapidly for several years, and leaders across the company were prioritizing the things that matter most to customers and the long-term health of the business. In September, Jassy said Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office. “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy said.

Interestingly, the news comes just weeks after the tech giant posted strong financial results. A company spokesperson stated that the planned job cuts are not related to performance, but are instead aimed at reducing layers of management. In the last few years or so, we have witnessed Microsoft laying off thousands of its employees. Back in 2023, the Redmond giant announced significant job cuts, affecting 10,000 employees. Microsoft then said it was a strategic decision to immunize itself from global changes. Fast forward to September of last year, the company fired 650 employees as part of Xbox job cuts. Now, a new round of layoffs is knocking on the doors, as Microsoft has announced its plan to lay off 3% of its total employees. If we go by the number, the planned layoffs will affect at least 6,000 Microsoft employees. The layoffs will affect employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. This year, Microsoft has announced job cuts for the second time. In January, the company fired a small number of employees based on performance reviews. However, this time it’s not related to performance. In a statement to CNBC, Microsoft’s spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” Microsoft’s spokesperson also told the news agency that one objective of the new round of layoffs is to reduce layers of management. It’s worth noting that Microsoft is funneling billions of dollars into its AI infrastructure. While it’s unclear, it could be one of the biggest reasons behind the new round of layoffs announced by Microsoft. Not to forget, the company is also actively renegotiating its partnership with OpenAI for IPO and funding. Interestingly, the new round of layoffs comes as the company posted a strong earnings report last month. The tech giant reported $70.1 billion in revenue and an 18 percent spike in profits for the January-March period. The company’s cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped it beat Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, Amazon also announced job cuts to reduce “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. One of Elon Musk’s employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young’s dual role — working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency — likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is “duplicative.’’ Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that “would cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality” and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration’s efforts to unwind the consumer agency’s operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young’s arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB — which regulates companies that provide financial services — has jurisdiction over Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world’s richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory, “Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” “Musk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,” said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. “And therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk’s personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.” Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk’s political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk’s payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry’s interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk’s Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to “advise political and public policy.” Beyond that description, it’s not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company’s activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk’s family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk’s children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE’s activities, said that Young’s government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. “Which hat are you wearing while you’re serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?” she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk’s private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will “continue to participate” in a “defined contribution plan” sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a “vice president” of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on “political and public policy,” the records show. While he lists the latter among “sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn’t respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn’t return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn’t responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, “I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.” The revelation of Young’s apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration’s attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning — actions one expert called a “pretty clear-cut violation” of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he “did not even manage” the layoffs, “making this entire narrative an outright lie.” A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn’t clear whether he did and the White House hasn’t answered questions about that. “These allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE’s critical mission,” the White House said. Following ProPublica’s reporting, the aide’s work at the CFPB ended. On Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica’s coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to “swiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.” ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it’s unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE’s efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. “It matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,” she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB’s acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau’s staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency’s employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration’s first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB’s headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency’s acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including “all contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.” Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk’s Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the “present.” Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration’s cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB’s chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a “reduction in force,” or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were “prepared to implement the RIF” if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration’s proposed cuts. Read More In addition to his employment, Young’s disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau’s “Prohibited Holdings” list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock’s value — such as stripping the CFPB of its staff — constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn’t responded to questions about that either. Al Shaw contributed reporting and Alex Mierjeski contributed research.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Price is one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption. But thanks to a new type of battery, General Motors plans to slash the cost of some of its rechargeable vehicles. The battery, which has been under development for a decade, uses more of the cheaper elements like manganese and far less cobalt and nickel than current lithium-ion cells. That will cut the cost of battery packs in models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer and Cadillac Escalade by more than $6,000, a GM executive told Forbes. And while GM currently falls behind Tesla as the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., that could change as Elon Musk’s firm struggles. Chime CEO and cofounder Chris Britt As the stock market rebounds, Chime, America’s largest digital bank, has filed publicly with the SEC for an initial public offering, revealing its detailed financials. Chime has catered largely to younger Americans earning between $35,000 and $65,000 and has built a sticky business by requiring customers to set up direct deposit to get access to a growing list of features. Donald Trump is considering accepting a plane from Qatar, a gesture from the energy-rich monarchy that plays directly to the billionaire’s ego. Trump has long preferred oversized planes, personalizing airliners too big to land in some airports over the more nimble jets that most executives prefer. Alan Marcus, a communications consultant who used to ride on Trump’s old Boeing 727, compared it to a stereotypical debate over the size of​ one’s male anatomy. Prices rose less than economists expected in the first inflation report since President Donald Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs. But while it was the most moderate inflation reading in over four years, the data doesn’t capture the full impact of tariffs on consumers—and the frequent changes in the tariff rates make it difficult to gauge what that will look like. In a move that could provide relief to ecommerce firms like Shein and Temu, the White House said it lowered tariffs on packages from China valued at less than $800 from 120% to 54%. Packages under that value were previously exempt from tariffs or customs duties through the “de minimis” loophole, which Trump eliminated, then reinstated, then eliminated again. After Forbes uncovered financial problems and layoffs at Wondermind, the mental health startup cofounded by actor and business mogul Selena Gomez, it set off a debate over how much Gomez is really worth. Forbes found that Gomez is very wealthy, but not a billionaire, worth roughly $700 million—though she still ranks among the wealthiest self-made women entrepreneurs in the country. A key court hearing took place Tuesday, as a coalition of small businesses are seeking to block President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as legal challenges against the import taxes move forward. It’s unclear how the court will rule, and it’s only the first step in what’s likely to be a lengthy legal process, as multiple lawsuits have been filed. Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara along with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin ... More Salman Al Saud. (Photo by Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Court/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after announcing plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, a significant boost to the country’s new leadership as it attempts to shore up international support after a nearly a decade and a half-long civil war. Addressing the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said he “felt very strongly” that dropping the “really crippling” sanctions would give Syria a chance. Operations at Newark Airport appear to have normalized after two weeks of chaos that included equipment failures in which air traffic controllers lost communication with pilots three times. The airport was under a ground delay Tuesday, but there were markedly fewer canceled and delayed flights, according to data from FlightAware. Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista After a decade-long beef with the SEC as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, the world’s largest meatpacker was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns of price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Over the past two decades, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista have turned their family’s South American meat business into a global goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Agnus Beef. The Batista brothers are the company’s largest shareholders, and Forbes estimates that Joesley and Wesley are worth $4.8 billion each. They have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil. But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation. WHY IT MATTERS In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon, though a JBS spokesperson denies that. Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” MORE Who’s Afraid Of Big Bad Boar’s Head? The U.S. faces substantial potential economic losses as a Canadian travel boycott continues to intensify. Canadians comprise the single largest cohort of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S.: 35%: The decline in the number of Canadians road-tripping to the U.S. last month, compared to a 20% drop for air travel $20.5 billion: How much Canadian travelers spent in the U.S. in 2024 140,000: The number of jobs that would be jeopardized by just a 10% reduction in Canadian inbound tourism, the U.S. Travel Association warned In times of economic uncertainty, many employers turn to layoffs—but there are hidden costs associated with cutting positions. Beyond the expenses like providing severance and increased administrative work, employee productivity can plummet, and studies have shown that voluntary turnover often increases as well. If it’s necessary to cut back, try to optimize management layers, reduce the workforce through natural attrition, and if you must lay off employees, be sure to treat them with dignity.

Title: The streaming wars are no longer just about who is the biggest

Good morning. One of the key accusers in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial testified Tuesday in court. R&B singer Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs for over a decade, spoke about joining in on the drug-fueled sex marathons that he called "freak offs." In today's big story, ESPN finally unveiled the streaming-only version of its channel, and it comes as streamers reevaluate how they judge success. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Brevan Howard taps a longtime JPMorgan dealmaker for a new senior role. Tech: Job cuts are officially underway at Microsoft. Business: The hidden intention behind some companies' RTO plans isn't about getting back to the office. But first, what channel stream is it on? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the last holdouts of the streaming era is finally making a move. ESPN unveiled plans — and a price — for its long-awaited streaming version of the sports channel. Business Insider's Peter Kafka has the rundown on Tuesday's launch event for ESPN's new service, which will cost $30 a month. (Not to be confused with ESPN+, which has been around for over seven years. While ESPN+ streams live games, the biggest sporting events can't be watched there without a cable TV subscription. Unlike ESPN+, this new streamer will include everything you'd get if you were watching ESPN on cable TV.) ESPN's willingness to finally cut the cord shows how much the TV landscape has changed. But it's not just streamers fighting for subscribers. From engagement to subscriber growth to profitability, streamers have different priorities, writes BI's James Faris. So what are the different strategies, and who is running them? James does a great job of breaking it all down, but here's a quick rundown. The engagement approach: Netflix, Amazon When you're at the top, you sometimes have to find new ways to define success. After clearing the 300 million subscriber milestone, Netflix is now focusing on keeping users engaged rather than just growing. The reason? Engaged users are good for ads, which is the next big opportunity the streamer sees. It's not alone, as Amazon went all in on ads last year when it automatically turned them on for Prime Video users who weren't willing to cough up $3 a month to remove them. The subscriber approach: Disney, Paramount+, Peacock For those not lucky enough to have a massive subscriber base, growing the number of users is still a priority. One challenge has been keeping the momentum from big events like the Olympics or NFL playoff games. Of course, sometimes you might have even more viewers than you realize. That's why password-sharing crackdowns are all the rage. The profitability approach: Max Subscribers. Engagement. Let's be honest, the end goal is the same: making money. Warner Bros. Discovery already conceded that Max won't rule the streaming roost. But it is in the black, something some of its peers can't claim. 1. Inflation surprisingly cooled in April. The inflation rate slowed to 2.3% last month from March's 2.4% year-over-year bump, making it the smallest increase since 2021. Still, forecasters said the effects of the trade war could show up as soon as next month. On the plus side, eggs are back on the menu for breakfast. 2. Brevan Howard hires Carlos Hernandez. The longtime JPMorgan dealmaker will be Brevan Howard's first-ever executive chair. A person close to the manager told BI that Hernandez's role will focus on high-level corporate strategy and client development. 3. Getting a job in secondaries. The investment strategy of buying stakes in private funds from investors who want to sell early used to be niche. Secondaries are now fundraising at record levels, and a lucrative career path is emerging. Here's how to land a job in the booming industry. 1. Microsoft's job cuts are here. The software giant has started culling managers and noncoders as part of its plan to shed about 6,000 jobs. It wants fewer managers with more reports, consistent with an industrywide push to flatten management layers. 2. AI companies stand to win in Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" — for now. The bill includes a provision preventing states from regulating AI for 10 years, a godsend for companies like OpenAI and Meta. However, there's a good reason they shouldn't start celebrating yet. 3. The CEOs behind your favorite YouTube stars. Content creators from MrBeast to Smosh are hiring leaders from Hollywood, talent management firms, and creator economy startups to level up their businesses. These executives allow creators to focus on content — and avoid burnout. 1. Employers have found a sneaky substitute for layoffs. Rather than conducting layoffs, some employers are using RTO mandates to get workers to quit. But companies adopting this take-it-or-leave-it approach to RTO can end up with the worst of both worlds, BI's Aki Ito writes. 2. You can now book private chefs and personal trainers on Airbnb. The company rolled out Airbnb Services, which lets users hire professionals like hairstylists or photographers to come to their Airbnb or home. An exec told BI it's one way the company is trying to win customers back from hotels. 3. Trump is asking Americans to do the one thing they hate most. Buying things is a national pastime, and Trump is the king of conspicuous consumption. But after issuing tariffs, the president is preaching austerity — a misread of both America's economy and culture. Sony reports earnings.

The company had around 228,000 employees worldwide as of June, it says, meaning more than 6,500 could be affected by the cuts. It would be one of the company’s largest staff reductions since it cut 10,000 people in 2023. A Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” In April, Microsoft reported a solid quarter of $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 18%), which was even better than analysts expected. Even so, this new round of layoffs is expected to hit all levels, locations, and teams. The company also had layoffs back in January, though it said those were performance-based. This fresh round of layoffs is not performance-related, a spokesperson told CNBC. Thousands upon thousands of workers have been laid off from Big Tech companies in just the past year. Amazon and Meta also conducted layoffs in January. Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch. She is based in New York City.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it’s laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It’s likely Microsoft’s largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing “unnecessary layers” in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn’t tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. “How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?” Nadella said. “At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don’t keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.” On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs

Microsoft (MSFT) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it’s laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people — making it the company’s largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of “organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” (What, not “vibrant” or “robust”?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an “Aaron Judge-like” earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Google (GOOGL) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called “year of efficiency,” and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google’s parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM), Spotify (SPOT), and Lyft (LYFT) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to “focus on the core,” often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers’ group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday’s move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative.

Title: 4 Side Gigs Earn Up To $30k Annual Income For Full-Time Workers

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Side hustles are no longer optional in today's economy. Many American full-time workers need ... More lucrative side gigs like these to keep up with rising costs. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today’s tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn’t really extra anymore, that it’s a necessity for many of today’s workers. “For many Americans, side hustles aren’t optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.” Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. “And with Trump’s tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,” she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they’re willing to dedicate five-to–10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they’re involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren’t worth it, you’re wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that’s over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: “Good writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,” Morgan insists. “The ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.” She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. “You don’t need many clients to get started,” Morgan notes. “Just offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it’s a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.” Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. “On platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it’s simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people’s stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.” “If you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,” Morgan recommends. “After one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‘a gift for a colleague’ or ‘greenery on the desktop.’ She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ”It takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. “From there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.” Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. “These sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,” she explains. “You can get $50 to $250 per participation.” She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. “To get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,” she advises. “Even if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that’s already $200-300.” SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you’re tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming — with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn “went more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‘here’s our big, splashy new content program,’” said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. “It was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of … There’s a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.” Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. “What was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,” said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn’s ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. “Business influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.” But it’s the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers — certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). “I think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing — the larger monetary commitment,” said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. “With more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we’re seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways — it’s what the buzz is all about … The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we’re going to see the shift.” “There’s a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,” said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets — yet. “Brands in a budget pinch are … really just trying to figure out where’s my biggest bang for my buck.” To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size — some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: “As media buyers, we’re really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they’re doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we’re watching TV,” Basis Technologies’ Freed said. “CTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it’s shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,” said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. “There’s definitely an appeal to that. It’s obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.” Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can’t be forgotten — just like they offer the lion’s share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it’s a more even playing field than ever. “This one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone’s getting connected through the pipeline,” said Jellyfish’s Dahir. “The digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we’re not able to in the past.” For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. “If I’m watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,” noted Dahir. “This creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports … I’m curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback … because there’s too many touch points that you can tag it.” And that’s where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there’s a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. “One theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it’s more about the curation of content and context,” said the buyer on background. “It’s making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier — when done right.” Added Basis Technologies’ Freed: “For buyers, it’s easier because we have more control — we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.” Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy — but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here’s the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): “It’s just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‘I’m going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.’ And they’re going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.” Microsoft is closing Xandr Invest, a sign that of its increased focus on AI and a harbinger of further ad tech consolidation. The Trade Desk’s Jeff Green discusses ad tech’s big issues. In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers. As uncertainty remains, we look at some different predictions and their impacts.
