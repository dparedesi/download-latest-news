CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) Are you getting over a *cough cough* cold today? If so, you’re one of the 22.6 million U.S. employees who were planning to miss work the Monday after the Super Bowl, a 40% increase from last year, according to The Harris Poll data from UKG. That number includes folks who planned to call in sick––even if they aren’t actually ill––as well as those who planned to “ghost” their employer by skipping work and not telling them. Some have pre-planned their absence, with 12.9 million taking PTO and 4.8 million swapping shifts with coworkers. Even then, an additional 12.9 million said they would be late to work on Monday. Talk about last-minute play calls. For those who did show up to work, productivity may have been down to start the week. The poll found that about 40% of those who watched the game and went to work would be distracted by media coverage of the game on Monday, up from 28% last year. While the scale of these absences is record-breaking, the phenomenon isn’t new. About 43% of employed Americans believe the Monday after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. Indiana is even taking steps to enshrine that idea into law: A bill was introduced in the state’s legislature last week that would make the day a state holiday. The number of workers calling out sick on Monday wasn’t the only record broken during the Super Bowl: While the Kansas City Chiefs failed to beat the Philadelphia Eagles to secure a three-peat, the game was the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. Fox garnered 126 million viewers across platforms, including its free streaming service Tubi. Happy reading, and hope you all have a lovely week!

Deep Dive: Employee Confidence Starts The Year On A Sour Note Employee confidence on their employer's business outlook has fallen to a February 2024 low, driven by economic fears and a new presidential administration. One month into 2025 and employees are not confident in the business outlook for their employers, according to a new Glassdoor report. Layoffs, economic fears and a new presidential administration are to blame. It’s a new year and employee confidence is once again going down. According to Glassdoor’s employee confidence index, which measures workers’ ratings of their employer’s six-month business outlook (either positive, negative or neutral), only 45.1% of U.S. employees have a positive view on their employer’s future. That’s the lowest percentage since last February, when the index hit its lowest since Glassdoor began tracking it in 2016. The weak sentiment comes on the heels of January’s jobs report that saw 143,000 non-farm jobs get added to the economy, lower than analyst expectations. It’s part of the reason as to why sentiment is low––economic anxieties, which rose in January, and news of layoffs have rattled workers. Those working in government and public administration positions lost the most confidence, according to Glassdoor, falling 2.8 percentage points compared to December. The legality of various Trump Administration policies affecting federal workers, including buyout offers, funding cuts and the effective closure of entire agencies like USAID, have made federal workers uneasy about their future. Full return-to-office plans and funding for state offices has also been put into question. That’s without counting the impact on federal contractors who’ve had their contracts and funding frozen, if not cut completely. Other industries, however, have seen an increase in confidence compared to last year. Insurance saw the biggest gain during a month filled with news of natural disasters and subsequent coverage questions. Aerospace and defense also saw a 5% increase in confidence from last year. Employee confidence levels also tend to differ based on seniority. Mid-level employees continue to feel the most anxious about the future and experienced the largest drop-off in confidence compared to other seniority levels, according to the data. In efforts to reduce costs and flatten out organizations, middle managers are often the first on the chopping block. News from the world of work “Financial loyalty at VC firms has never been weaker,” an endowment leader recently told Forbes. It’s part of a larger movement of venture capital partners leaving blue-chip firms (think Lightspeed, Sequoia and a16z) to start their own funds. Meet venture’s new guard. The U.S. added 143,000 non-farm jobs in January, lower than analysts estimated and the weakest January total since 2016. Unemployment, however, topped expectations, though January did mark the ninth-consecutive month of at least 4% unemployment. These numbers are more of an indicator of the job market President Trump is inheriting, rather than any impact he’s had on it thus far. While at least 65,000 federal workers have accepted the “deferred resignation” offer from the new administration, the deadline was again paused by a federal judge on Monday until the president “responds” to the issues at the heart of the several lawsuits brought on by federal workers unions. Google is the latest major employer to roll back its DEI initiatives. On Wednesday, the company said it would remove all of its diversity hiring targets, before removing cultural observances like Pride Month and Black History Month from Google Calendar. All in all, over a dozen major companies have pared back or removed references to DEI in their 2024 annual reports. Amazon employees are increasingly worried about their career trajectories as the company flattens middle management roles in an effort to cut costs, according to Bloomberg. Those looking to climb the corporate ladder have been told to consider “horizontal development,” in other words, acquiring different skills with no promotion. Are workplace feuds the new trend for increased PR? Billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been squabbling it out in the media over the funding to President Trump’s Stargate program. While their supposed feud dates back to 2015, when both Altman and Musk were among the cofounders of OpenAI, the public comments picked up again this year. Meanwhile, Super Bowl halftime performer Kendrick Lamar’s feud with Drake not only took center stage on Sunday, but has also won the rapper multiple Grammy Awards.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow. Constructive comments welcome, as always.

Title: The impact of Trump's tariffs is already being felt

Hello there! Business Insider saw a list of nearly 30 staffers at the White House DOGE office. The group, which is helping Elon Musk embark on a massive reshaping of the federal government, consists of mostly early and mid-career professionals. In today's big story, new tariff plans spell trouble for Canada while the trade war is already impacting influencer marketing. What's on deck Markets: The consultants and podcasters trying to demystify how the world's largest hedge funds are run. Tech: Meta's performance-based cuts don't mean it's done hiring. Business: President Trump's buyout plan for federal workers is still on pause. But first, more trade trouble. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Another day. Another tariff. President Donald Trump is targeting steel and aluminum with his latest tariff plans, enacting a 25% tax on the metal imports. That's set to have a big impact on Canada, a top supplier of both steel and aluminum to the US, writes Business Insider's Allie Kelly and Madison Hoff. Mexico, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and China are also big metal exporters to the US. What's bad for our trading partners is good for some American companies. Before the tariffs were even official, shares of US Steel still jumped as much as 6% on Monday. The trade taxes are a double win for local steel producers, writes Matthew Fox, as it will limit foreign companies' ability to flood the US market with lower-priced steel while also giving them the flexibility to raise their prices. Investors in gold have also been big winners, as precious metals could be hit with tariffs next. More broadly, gold has been viewed as a safe haven amid constant uncertainty over the threat of new tariffs. The impact of tariffs is already being felt in another corner of the economy. Some fashion brands are pausing influencer campaigns and blaming it on US tariffs, write BI's Amanda Perelli, Dan Whateley, and Geoff Weiss. Halara and Shein are pausing some campaigns as they assess what the tariffs will mean for their businesses. It's yet another blow to an industry grappling with the threat of a TikTok ban. But it's also far from the only market facing tariff-related headaches. If things escalate to the point where countries implement retaliatory tariffs on the US, S&P 500 firms could see an 8% hit to their earnings, according to Bank of America. A lot of the concerns over tariffs remain speculative, though. And some have long dismissed Trump's trade plans as a negotiation tactic to obtain better trading terms. But even if that's the case, the uncertainty surrounding what will and won't happen continues to cause problems. Nike had the buzziest Super Bowl ad on social media, data shows. 1. Sorry, coffee drinkers. Your morning cup of joe might start costing more. Eggs aren't the only breakfast staple under pressure. Coffee prices are expected to climb this year thanks to supply snags that could exacerbate the shortage of beans, BofA analysts said. Last week, Arabica coffee prices closed at an all-time high of $4.04 per pound — and analysts said they expect coffee retail prices to keep going up. 2. Video game stocks are looking to notch a new high score. Pent-up demand for long-awaited releases like Grand Theft Auto 6 and the Nintendo Switch 2 is boosting video game companies' shares. The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF is up 12% this year, far outstripping the S&P 500's 3% year-to-date return. 3. Demystifying big-name hedge funds. Former portfolio managers are launching podcasts, Substacks, and consulting firms to assist with talent development and offer an inside look at top funds like Citadel and Point72. These voices also give prospective PMs and analysts a reality check on what it really takes to succeed at those companies. (Hint: It's a lot of hard work.) 1. Meta speeds up hiring despite layoffs. As the social media giant slashes thousands of low performers from its workforce, Meta is also expediting its hiring process for engineers. It's specifically focused on machine-learning, according to an internal memo. 2. AI is Gen Z's work buddy. A growing number of Gen Z workers leverage AI at the office, from drafting emails to conducting research. While AI's proponents say it can free up their time to focus on higher-level responsibilities, others caution against relying too heavily on the technology. Still, older workers need to keep pace. 3. The Elon Musk v. Sam Altman feud continues. Musk and a group of investors submitted an unsolicited offer to buy "all assets" of OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. "It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk wrote. Altman quickly dismissed the offer, leading to a back-and-forth exchange between the two on X. 1. Former federal workers for hire … but not too many yet. As a judge continues to pause the federal worker buyout plan, economists are weighing in on what the resignations could mean for the labor market. So far, the number of people who accepted the offer is relatively low, and many may plan to retire anyway. But things could heat up further as federal funding tightens. 2. How Fox is (sort of) getting back with its exes. YouTube isn't the only media company betting on podcasts. Fox Corp. bought Red Seat Ventures, a podcasting company that happens to handle production and ad sales for former Fox News stars Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. BI's Peter Kafka breaks down the move. 3. TikTok Shop challenges Amazon with its new subscription feature. In the latest move to compete with its e-commerce peers, TikTok Shop is testing a subscription feature, similar to Amazon's subscribe-and-save tool, that would allow users to repeatedly receive products in exchange for a discount. The feature would help sellers lock in recurring revenue and manage shipment amid sale surges from viral videos. Amazon has more than 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment centers.

Title: AI Replacement? Meta Cuts 3,600 Jobs To Focus On AI Talent

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 31: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary ... [+] Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. The committee heard testimony from the heads of the largest tech firms on the dangers of child sexual exploitation on social media. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Perhaps the biggest threat to our jobs isn’t AI — but other, more talented people. Or so seems to be the case with Meta’s latest batch of layoffs. The tech giant is about to cut thousands of employees as part of a larger effort to phase out “low-performers” and rope in fresh meat for its AI expansion, Bloomberg reported. Affected workers were notified via email earlier today. According to Bloomberg’s sources, Meta is handing severance packages that include 16 weeks of pay in addition to two weeks of additional pay for each year of service. Employees with performance reviews that merited a bonus are expected to still get one, and staffers are still entitled to stock awards as part of the upcoming vesting cycle later this month. U.S. employees will be first to be notified of the layoffs, with international colleagues expected to be informed later, although the timeline for that is uncertain. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced the cuts will affect about 5% of the workforce — about 3,600 people — starting with hires that “aren’t meeting expectations.” The plan is to use the resources from the layoffs to power its AI development and focus on securing the “strongest talent.” After a long streak of staving off layoffs, this marks yet another round of cuts at Meta. Notably, the company parted ways with thousands of employees in 2022 and 2023. For his part, Zuckerberg has previously spoken about Meta’s plans to inject billions into building out its AI infrastructure, which will power multiple products and services across its lineup, including but not limited to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads. That’s hardly a surprise considering the speed at which Meta’s rivals like Amazon, Google and OpenAI are accelerating their AI efforts. DeepSeek’s entry into the fray has only further heated up the AI race for supremacy. As Sam Altman reflected in a recently penned essay on AI, “the intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.” Zuckerberg seems to be of the same mind — hence why Meta is shuffling spending around to lure in more AI talent.

Title: Meta Workforce Reductions Expected to Continue Through February

Meta began notifying employees affected by its previously announced job cuts on Monday (Feb. 10). The company’s emails notifying those who were being let go marked the beginning of a process that is expected to continue through the end of Meta’s performance cycle that goes to the end of February and result in terminations of as many as 3,600 employees, Bloomberg reported Monday. While U.S. staffers are being notified Monday, international employees could learn later, according to the report. With this headcount reduction, Meta aims to lay off “low performers” before adding new talent that will aid the company’s competitiveness in the artificial intelligence market, the report said. It was reported in January that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its workforce and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote at the time in an internal message, per a CNBC report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” It was reported Friday (Feb. 7) that AI investments by the four biggest tech firms — Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft — jumped 63% last year and will jump again in 2025 to reach a combined capital expenditure that could surpass $320 billion. Executives at these companies are pledging to up their investments in AI, pushing aside worries about the massive amounts they’re spending on the technology. This year will also be a decisive one for Meta’s metaverse efforts. It was reported Feb. 3 that Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of Meta’s metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” During Meta’s latest earnings call, Zuckerberg told analysts that while the number of users of the company’s Quest and Horizon offerings has been growing, “we’re going to know a lot more about Horizon’s trajectory by the end of this year.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Sen. Ron Wyden is here to stop Elon Musk

The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Democrat from Oregon says ‘we’re going to use every tool’ to try and thwart Elon Musk’s DOGE. by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and the senior senator from Oregon. He’s been in the Senate for almost 30 years, which makes him one of the longest-serving members of the institution. He’s also deeply involved in tech policy — in fact, he co-authored Section 230 in 1996. That’s the law that says tech platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube aren’t generally liable for what their users post, making it the law that basically allows the modern social media internet we have today to even exist. We scheduled this interview with Sen. Wyden a while ago — he’s got a new book out called It Takes Chutzpah: How to Fight Fearlessly for Progressive Change, and it’s a combination memoir and call to action for young people to take part in politics. Wyden was going to come on and talk about that book. But recent events made it vastly more important to talk about the state of our federal government and, specifically, what Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are doing as they seize power in various federal agencies. DOGE has some level of access in the Treasury Department and now has its sights set on the Labor and Education departments, too. Numerous agencies have had their funding frozen, with workers locked out and told to resign or put on leave, all while lawsuits are being filed and courts are telling the administration to hold on. It is utter chaos, and it’s not slowing down. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! So I asked Sen. Wyden as bluntly as I could: What the fuck is even going on? And can Congress and the courts even keep up with it? Wyden did not mince words here; he called it a coup. You’ll hear us get into the mechanisms Musk has used to seize power in the government and why it feels like any attempts to slow this down feel so flat-footed. We also discuss whether we can trust anything these people say — Wyden basically calls bullshit on virtually every promise and declaration coming out of DOGE, especially around how much access its staffers have to sensitive data and systems. It’s the story of the moment and we dove into it. But if not for DOGE and its associated chaos, the biggest tech policy story of the moment would be TikTok, which was legally banned by an act of Congress and then upheld by the Supreme Court. But enforcement of that ban was paused for 75 days by President Donald Trump so the company could figure out how to sell itself. Right now, it’s just in a legal gray area, and that clock is ticking. So I asked Sen. Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, what’s going on with that ban and if Trump can really just keep delaying enforcement of the law, which is also not a great legal situation. Wyden seems to think a deal can get done, and I did my best to get any hints about who might buy it. There’s a lot more in this one, including some discussion of our networks themselves and Trump’s newly censorious Federal Communications Commission, but it’s probably best to just get into it. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that Sen. Wyden manages to seamlessly plug his new book throughout this episode. Okay, Sen. Ron Wyden. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sen. Ron Wyden, welcome to Decoder. Hey, thanks for having me again. Thank you for being on. There’s an awful lot to talk about, senator. You have a new book. There are an escalating series of catastrophes in the government. There’s TikTok to talk about. It’s still banned, but unbanned in a liminal state. I want to ask you about that. I was listening to our audience, and I was talking to our staff. Can I ask you the first question in just the bluntest way that I can think of? Can I have your permission for that? Permission granted, bluntness. All right. Senator, what the fuck is going on? That is the question of the hour. It’s almost impossible to divine an answer because it moves minute to minute. Donald Trump essentially governs by whim. He gets up and out of nowhere, he will put our whole economy in play with a really colossally stupid approach to tariffs — Tariffs that he has lied nonstop to the American people about for well over a year. He always tells them that foreigners will pay the tariff. That’s factually wrong. All of the people who are listening to your program, the fans of the good work you all do, they pay the tariffs. So, this weekend was just perpetual bedlam, and foreign leaders were basically laughing at us. They were making fake promises. They knew that Trump just wanted to be able to get some kind of headline. I’m sure we’ll talk about other aspects of the bizarre nature of these times, but you probably know that last Friday, I blew the whistle — as a result of getting input from whistleblowers — that the Secretary of Treasury had signed off on giving Elon Musk access to the federal payments program, which has enormous implications for hacking, abuse, and violations of privacy. The list could go on and on. So, that’s just a little bit of the last few days. Let’s start there. Again, just hearing from our audience, our listeners, and readers of The Verge, there is a sense that what is happening right now is Donald Trump is sitting in the White House, signing executive orders that may or may not be legal, may or may not have impact, may or may not mean anything at all, talking about building hotels in Gaza. And that is all a distraction from Elon Musk and DOGE taking over the government. We’re all the way at “is this a coup?” I really want to start there. Is that where you’re at? Do you think that there’s a coup going on? I’m very troubled by the types of policies they are pursuing, that when you add them up, look and feel like a coup. The reality is we are working very hard to derail them at various steps. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week, Donald Trump basically undertook a kind of freeze of the budget, and he wanted to do it unilaterally. There was a lot of back and forth about what authority he might possibly have. We knew there wasn’t any, but we heard him out. Then we went to court, we won, and he had to drop it. Let me give you a small snapshot of the kind of work I do. My background is working with senior citizens. I was the director of the Gray Panthers for about seven years before I got elected to Congress. So, during the freeze, I found out that the Medicaid portals, which they have in all states, were essentially off. They weren’t available for the senior citizens and the disabled to get information about their medicine, nursing homes, and the like. So, I went online immediately, and said that the whistleblowers, which were truthful, had told me about the tremendous problems being caused for the vulnerable, seniors, and the like, and that it was important for citizens to get in touch with their elected officials, community groups, and organizations and talk about why this was so unfair. Nobody voted to cause harm and discomfort to seniors and the disabled. And there was this outpouring of calls and letters. Within about three hours, the Trump people were backpedaling. By late at night, they said that it would all be fixed the next day. This is just a small snapshot from one day, but people mobilized. The whistleblowers that I work with, particularly on senior citizen issues, came through. This was something where Trump and Musk were stopped cold as they tried to abuse the federal budget. It’s a small snapshot, but it’s the kind of thing that I tried to help with. If I were to embrace it in a sentence, apropos of what the hell is going on here: Trump and Musk are ignoring the checks and balances that are the foundation of our republic. And for all practical purposes, I’d call that a coup. When you think about the mechanism that you just laid out, you heard about something that was happening that was bad because of a policy that was hastily rolled out, you mobilized some attention, there was a swarm of negative feedback for the policy, and eventually, the administration backed down. Maybe it’s fixed, maybe it’s not. This is an open question. Programs are still being unfunded, right? I will tell you on this point, we check every day to make sure that seniors can get their Medicaid, their medicine, and access to nursing home information. But your general point is correct. There’s still a flood of abuses in a whole variety of programs across the government. Can that mechanism of “I need to blow the whistle, then maybe a flood of outrage that’ll fix it, or maybe we’ll file a lawsuit and our courts will fix it” keep up with the pace and scale of the chaos happening right now? We’re going to use every possible tool: court actions, legislative actions, whistleblowers, the bully pulpit. We’re going to use it all. We are still trying to find our way through the array of remedies that we have. When my wife agreed to marry me. She said, “You aren’t a real lawyer. You worked with the Gray Panthers. So, I’ll marry you because you’re not a real lawyer.” We’re now looking through all of the legal tools to make sure that we can protect our rights. But it’s not going to be a walk in the park. In some of these areas, like with the federal payments, nobody ever even thought of doing what Trump is doing, which is why it’s so important that we stop him. Let’s talk about that for a second. Do you know how much access Elon Musk has to the overall federal government right now? Has that been quantified for you or is it just ever increasing because it’s chaos? We believe that it’s ever increasing because to a great extent, Mr. Musk tells us that it is increasing. There was a big story that there wasn’t much being done, just general information. I got asked by the press about it late last night, and I said, “You got to be kidding me. Just look at all the stuff that he claims he is doing.” The first thing he went after was a charity. It didn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud, and abuse. I believe that we will move quickly in the days ahead to build more tools for a legal strike approach. We’re talking about that as members of a Democratic caucus. I’ve been tasked particularly with promoting privacy for those concerned that their data would be peddled hither and yon in the payments system. I can tell you that from a privacy standpoint, giving out people’s home addresses and the like, this will be a horror show. There’s a big question right now over whether Musk and his team’s access to that system is read-only or if they have the ability to write code. They have said it’s read-only. There’s some reporting that says they have the ability to write code. Do you know if it’s read-only? I believe that this is data that’s being abused now. Part of this is also semantics. I’m not taking anything off the table in terms of what they’re doing. They can write code. There’s no question about that. So, you think this argument over whether or not it’s read-only is a semantic distraction? That they do have full access to the system? Correct. There is no question that this description is designed to lull people into thinking that Elon Musk is not doing what he tells people he’s doing. I mean, he tells people that he is doing all these things, and then they put out these cover-up stories about how he’s not really doing it. We have a very technical audience. They’re very worried that we have increased the surface area for cyberattacks– No question about it! Let me save you some time. No question about it! Have you heard this from our intelligence agencies? Is this something Congress is worried about? I am on the [Senate] Intelligence Committee, so I can’t say anything about that. Is the Trump administration broadly being responsive to these concerns? Because we are at risk of cyberattacks. It’s a pretty bipartisan concern. No, the Trump people aren’t telling us anything about anything. Do you think they know what Elon is doing fully? You asked me if Trump just sits in the office and issues executive orders. I think that’s largely what’s going on. I’m sure they have some conversations, but I don’t get the feeling that there are any checks and balances on Elon. That’s for sure. There’s a weird gap in every Trump administration. I think it’s even weirder here in Trump 2.0 where Republican officials will not criticize the president in public. Are they understanding or aware of the scale of the problem in private when you talk to them? They’re saying very little in the consideration of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination. For example, yesterday I brought up that our committee, the Senate Finance Committee, had passed a bipartisan measure to rein in these pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) that are ripping off seniors, taxpayers, and people of all ages purchasing medicine. I pointed out that Medicare and Medicaid are under the jurisdiction of our committee and are subject to the kind of abuses that could happen with Musk and the federal payments. And they looked up. It was clear that what I said was registering them. I said, “This is important. This is something all of you have voted for.” But they’re not speaking out. In fact, yesterday, there was apparently some kind of Republican show trial where they basically all lined up and said, “Nothing to see here.” Do you think that holds? Let me put it this way. There’s no way this will be something they can just continue to stonewall. Let me give you an example. I announced five days ago that the Secretary of Treasury had given the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. Yesterday there were thousands and thousands of Americans outside the Treasury Dept. speaking out against these practices. Something like 30 members of Congress addressed this, making it clear that we were going to keep at it until we secured the protections that our citizens deserve. That happened all within five days. I give great credit to the whistleblowers. We heard a rumor that there was some activity going on with the Treasury payments, and the whistleblowers were the ones who specifically told me that Scott Bessent had signed off on giving the keys to Musk. That set of whistleblowers is largely the federal workforce, which is appalled. They’re filing their own actions from their unions as private citizens — just worker protection lawsuits. They’ve also all been told to quit their jobs, right? They’ve received these letters that say, “You should resign.” Musk famously used “fork in the road,” which is from a letter he sent when he took over Twitter. That may or may not be legal. There’s some big questions around that. Have you been hearing from that constituency? Yeah, they’d like some answers about it. You can hear the headline, “Oh, we’ll buy you out. We’ll give you all these opportunities to make a transition.” But most of the experience that the federal workforce has had with Trump — and it goes to the first administration — has not exactly been confidence building. They’d like more details about how they and their families will be affected. This is not just their current and future income, but making sure that the benefits they’ve accrued get treated fairly. What advice would you give to those workers that have received this offer? Proceed with great caution. Do you think that’s a farce as well? Do you think this is just a cover for mass layoffs? Is that something you’re worried about? Yeah! I don’t trust any of this stuff. I don’t want to sound like the old-fashioned version of a broken record, but I don’t trust any of this stuff. Often you go to these meetings and they act like they’re on the level, and then they go and do everything they want. That was the first administration, so I don’t trust any of this. When it sounds appealing and you can’t get specific answers, that ought to be a wake-up call to make sure you check. The law limits his ability to make mass layoffs, so that’s a big part of the debate too. We’re talking on a Wednesday. We usually publish Decoder interviews on Mondays. Usually, that’s fine, right? There’s two business days between us talking and publishing the conversation. Usually, not a lot happens in two days. You can be sure that a lot’s going to happen tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Tomorrow, we have a hearing on international trade. I described some of the bizarre practices that they’ve pursued in this space, like how they keep saying that the foreigners are going to pay the tariffs but it’s going to be your listeners instead. So you bet, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, there’s no days off here with the Trump whims, as I call them. The specific question I had there involves Elon tweeting, “I work on the weekends when the other team is not in the field.” The other team that he’s describing is the federal workforce, so that is already problematic. But Congress goes into recess. People leave town on the weekends. Are you and the Democrats ready to be here all weekend to see what he’s up to? They’re making a big deal out of saying they want to work around the clock. Look, I told you that I have this book, It Takes Chutzpah. I’ve been using some of the lessons in It Takes Chutzpah all week to try and tackle the Trump administration. I was flying across the country and taking red eyes to make sure I didn’t miss a minute in the effort to blow the whistle. That was what we were doing late on Friday night, in terms of Musk being given the keys to the Treasury payments. I know the Republicans are leaving town this weekend, so they managed to find ways to set an agenda that’s favorable to them. Has the DOGE team been responsive to you or other Democrats at all throughout this period? Absolutely not. I know no one who’s being briefed on the Democratic side consistently. At all, really. Is there a way for you to get that insight as a member of Congress? We’re continuing, for example, to follow up with individuals who used to work at the Treasury and tap them for their knowledge. That’s been very helpful. Obviously, I can’t get into that. Are you planning to find a way to hold hearings on any of the committees you’re on or call Elon as a witness on any of the committees you’re on? We’re going to use every tool to excavate the information that the American people deserve. This is one of the most important issues I’ve tackled in my time in public service. It’s actually one of the first rules of Chutzpah that I spell out: “if you want to make a difference, you have to make some noise.” We’re making plenty of noise right now. We just have to keep following through until we get the job done. One of the weirder aspects with Elon Musk in all of this is that he owns a communications platform, the preferred communication platform of many members of government. Is that a problem, that he can command attention, that he can run that algorithm any way he wishes? Do you think you have to go somewhere else? There are certainly questions with respect to how he runs his operations, and there’s certainly some questions involving China as well. We’ll have some more to say about that before long. You are famously one of the authors of Section 230, which protects service providers from liability for the content their users post. Elon is the service provider. He’s also the user that is posting the content. Do you have any newer thoughts about Section 230 in all this mix? Do you think it’s doing the job the way it’s intended for it to be working? I’ve said this on your show, but I’ve always felt that the big guys — of which Elon is about the biggest — always have the biggest checking account to be able to buy what they want. Elon Musk just bought a presidential campaign. He basically was the big giver. Section 230, as you and I have talked about, is all about making sure there’s a voice for the little guy: the #MeToo [movement], Black Lives Matter, the people who probably couldn’t get a message out without what Section 230 involves. I think that Section 230 continues to be an immensely valuable tool for the person who doesn’t have a political action committee, doesn’t have power, doesn’t have a deep checkbook. We’re going to have a problem reining in the Elon Musks no matter what because they can buy the kind of government they want… at least until we get rid of things like Citizens United. The other rich guy in the mix this time is Mark Zuckerberg, who also owns several large communications platforms. He’s notably changing his moderation standards to favor the Trump administration’s desires. He’s allowing more hate speech, particularly against trans people, on his platform. That’s something that Section 230 protects, right? That platforms can moderate however they want. Ideally, you have some competition for moderation standards to push and pull and give people places to go, but we don’t really see that today, right? We see sort of a herd mentality. There’s some competition. Anybody can sue Elon right now. He posts lies himself. Section 230 protects Elon’s competitors against Trump’s FCC. There are protections, but the bottom line is that when you have somebody as rich as Musk, who literally bought a presidential campaign, you’ve got to use every tool you got, and a lot of them are not Section 230. There’s another platform in the mix that seemed very relevant during the presidential campaign, TikTok. It was banned, the law passed, the Supreme Court upheld it, and Trump paused enforcement of it. Do you think that Trump’s enforcement pause on TikTok is legal? Is that just him pushing his authority some more? I don’t think it’s legal, but here’s what I think this debate is all about. The reality is that from day one I had the same position, unlike Donald Trump. Donald Trump was against it, and now he’s for it. I always said it would be a good thing to have an American company run TikTok and have them tightly vetted. That would, for example, have limited [former Treasury Secretary] Steve Mnuchin and others who talked about getting access to it. I’m still in favor of that as a policy issue. The question now is what the courts are going to say given that there’s been an act of Congress, but I have not changed my preference once since the very beginning. What were the problems with TikTok under ByteDance that required that original ban-or-sell law? I’m on the Intelligence Committee, and the issue is the closeness to the Chinese government. That was a national security issue. There’s a lot of young people today who would say, “Sure, but then, Elon Musk is going to buy it and we see what he did to X. That is as much of a national security problem today as the Chinese government owning the algorithm.” Musk could not pass the Ron Wyden test because you would have to have a reputable American buyer who’d been thoroughly vetted. I don’t think Musk, with all his China connections, could pass the test that I’ve described. Have you heard about any buyers for TikTok so far? Rumors, but nothing that I’m going to splay out in front of a national radio audience. The reality is Trump, as he usually does, just governs by whim. He starts off by saying, “TikTok is bad.” Then he learns that there are a bunch of young people who like it, and suddenly, he’s trying all of these exotic ways to deal with it. I said from the very beginning that my first choice was to have an American buyer who could pass rigorous vetting to show that they were independent and would meet public interest standards. I don’t think Trump’s interested much in that. In fact, you’d think that at some point, he’s just going to figure out a way to hotwire a deal where he sells TikTok, in some way, to Musk directly. And if he does, that’d be about the most corrupt example I could find. That vetting process is not contemplated in the bill, right? It’s an interagency process. Yeah, this would take extra work to lock it in place, but that’s been my position from the beginning. The reason I’m focused on this is that I see a lot of danger of algorithmic ownership. You see how Musk has managed to distort the conversation on X because he owns that algorithm. I don’t know how changing the content moderation standards on Facebook and Instagram will play out, but my expectation is a lot of minority and queer creators are going to face a lot more harassment on those platforms because the rules have been changed. The algorithm will allow more things to happen. If the danger of TikTok is, the algorithm is owned by somebody– Hey, can I just make one point I think I may have misstepped on? I am not for the ban. I am for finding a way to get this right with an American buyer. Right. I guess my question is if divestiture was required due to Chinese ownership of the algorithm, which would run counter to US interests, do you think that having some amount of algorithmic transparency or privacy protections would solve that problem with American buyers as well? From our audience, what I hear is that all you really need is algorithmic transparency, and then, China should be able to do whatever it wants. Not only do you need algorithm transparency, you got a guy who’s authored a bill that moves in that direction called the Algorithmic Accountability Act, my legislation. Under a Trump administration with this Congress, do you think that will go anywhere? We’ll see. A lot of people now understand that algorithms are pretty complicated, but when you talk about protecting people’s education, healthcare, and jobs, they get interested. Sure. Trump gave 75 days, which is just a number he apparently made up, and if we hit the 75 days and he says, “I’m going to extend it again,” do you think there will be litigation, at that point, about whether the law is actually in effect? Hard to say. Would you support that? We can’t just keep indefinitely postponed enforcement of a law? I think I’ve described the path to get this done, and I’m going to keep working for that. What do you say to TikTok creators right now who don’t know if their businesses will last another 50 days? I’d tell them I’m busting my chops to get them something resembling an American buyer who’s been carefully vetted and protects their interests and all American interests. Do you think Microsoft is a good buyer? For the audio listener, Sen. Wyden looked away first before he began answering that question. Put me down as pretty dubious, but we’ll see. All right. What about Oracle? No. All right. What about Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty? No. No, across the board. Right. I think we ought to bag it on these kinds of folks. I’m just curious. Okay. Amazon? I’m just not going to get into a lineup evaluation batter by batter. In the tech world, this is everyone’s parlor game beyond “does Elon run the government.” Those are the two things everyone talks about at the parties I go to. So I’m just curious. It has to be done. The clock is running out. I think we got pretty far down the road in terms of Elon running the government and what I’m going to try to do to stop him. We probably have a ways to go in terms of TikTok, but I think I’ve spelled out what I think ought to be done. At least it’s consistent from day one. Last question on TikTok, and I promise I’ll move on to the FCC because I’m very curious for your opinion there as well. The clock is running, right? There’s only 50, 60 more days. Do you think the deal can be made in time? Yeah, but you’re really going to have to hustle to get the right kind of parties and go through the process. But yes, it’s doable. Let’s talk about the FCC again. You are a First Amendment advocate. You have said to me on this show, to people on other shows, that Section 230, which you co-authored, is really about the First Amendment, and most people’s problems with 230 are really about First Amendment-protected speech. The First Amendment, from my point of view, is under the greatest full-frontal attack I’ve ever encountered as a journalist. Could not agree more. It is bizarre to me. It’s particularly bizarre because it’s wrapped up in the language of free speech. In particular, that language comes from new FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who is attacking CBS, NBC, ABC, and radio stations about how they’re using their spectrum and threatening to take that spectrum away. Is Congress paying attention to this? It feels like a sideshow, but to me, this is the most overt government speech regulation I’ve ever seen. It’s not getting a lot of attention in Congress, but I’m doing everything I can to light the place up around it because I share your view that a big chunk of what the Trump crowd and the far-right want to do is act in the name of free speech. They make all these proclamations about how they’re about free speech, but they’re trying to do everything possible to deny the voices they don’t agree with. Have you spoken to the chairman about the FCC? He put out a blog post today saying that he’s worried about TV commercials that are too loud, which sounds like it’s straight out of the 80s. At the same time, he’s opening inquiries into CBS News. Have you spoken to him? Have you pushed anything? I have not since his appointment, but it’s very predictable. They find something to try and make sound relevant, but it is completely irrelevant to the big question. That makes it less likely the public’s going to pick up on the big question. I’ve had 1,103 town hall meetings, and you can read about them in It Takes Chutzpah. They’re open to all, and I don’t give any speeches. I just show up and say, “For the next 90 minutes you can say your peace. Ask me any kind of question.” It is, to me, my vision of the First Amendment. My dad was a journalist and an author. Right next to me is one of his books on the Bay of Pigs, with a picture of Fidel Castro next to my dad in the book. The caption is “Peter Wyden knows more about it than we do,” coming from Castro. So, I’m a journalist kid, and I think the Founding Fathers, who said that a free press was more important than government, got it right. And I believe that. Normally you would see these big companies look at an FCC (particularly a 2025 FCC) complaining about news distortion over their broadcast spectrum, and they would just bat it away, right? They would send the lawyers, the lawyers would fight, and they would bat it away. Meta was sued by Trump himself for banning Trump while he was president, saying that was somehow a state action. Very confusing. Meta settled this case and agreed to pay Trump $25 million for his library. It seems like CBS is going to end up settling the 60 Minutes case. Hey, let me give you the real– But I’m just asking, the big companies are caving on the First Amendment. They’re the ones that should be fighting. They are caving like crazy, and nobody has caved more than Mark Zuckerberg. So Zuckerberg goes to Mar-a-Lago, and he tells Trump what he wants to hear. There aren’t going to be any fact-checkers. “Okay, Donald, just what you wanted. No fact-checkers.” He scores some points with Trump. My guess is that seeing how this was successful for Zuckerberg, a lot of the other big players are going to go down to Mar-a-Lago and look for favors also. In the process, what’s going to happen is that we’re going to re-consolidate big communications and have even fewer small voices than we had before the internet came into being. We ought to be protecting those small voices. What Zuckerberg is now a part of is doing more to help the big voices, and in effect, push the little guys out of communications. That visit by Zuckerberg to Mar-a-Lago and what he did with the fact-checkers was a god awful thing to do for the future of communications. But if Zuckerberg caves, Disney caves, and Shari Redstone caves because she wants to sell Paramount to Skydance so she rolls with the CBS lawsuit. No one shows up in court and says, “Actually, these threats violate the First Amendment.” Don’t we just lose the First Amendment? Doesn’t the pressure just work? How do you push back? We’ll have to find ways to crank up the pressure, and I’m going to do that. You have people like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that might step in, or other kinds of groups. ACLU. The ACLU, EFF, Ron Wyden, and those are your three. Sign me up. The argument I’ve heard from the other side — I’m not saying I agree with it, but I’ve heard it and I understand where it comes from — is that these are mercenary moves. Meta spending its time and energy fighting a First Amendment lawsuit instead of just paying the money runs the risk of them losing, right? It’s worse for Meta to roll into courts — especially all the way up to the Supreme Court, which is 6-3 conservative — and lose a First Amendment lawsuit than to just pay the money and leave the law effectively where it is, even if the norms change. Do you buy that argument? No. I think that both of them are harmful, and I think Zuckerberg is looking at buying whatever influence he possibly can because he sees it works. It’s not that complicated. Write big checks and you get influence with Trump. Carr is now targeting NPR and PBS. He’s saying that they’re technically running ads by asking for viewer support even though they’re publicly funded, and that he should look into their content. Is there a way for us to try to protect NPR or PBS? The best way to do it is by statute, and we’ll see if any of these rural Republicans whose farmers really like those services in the morning are going to stand up for them. What we’re describing is continued good business for the big guys, and they’re doing all the things possible to run out their competition. That includes virtually everything you can see. I’m trying to find new ways to get voices for people who don’t have power and clout join with a Republican trying to get more streaming services. So we’re busy looking for all the options, like getting C-SPAN out and streaming. You’re talking about rural farmers. You spoke earlier in the show about the outcry from people and Republicans backing down. Are you seeing the policy hit on some of these Republican constituents actually driving change? Are you able to reach those populations? I think a lot of people are worried that they’re fully captured by whatever TikTok right-wing influencer they see. It’s very early. I gave you some examples where we had some effect, but let me give you the bottom line here. I think very rarely does political change start in Washington, D.C. and then trickle down. I believe it’s almost always in the exact opposite direction. When people at home get concerned about access to communications they care about and whether they’re getting clobbered by tariffs, they go to their elected officials. They’ll see them in a grocery store, they’ll see them at the gas station, they’ll see them someplace and say, “What the hell are you doing? I’m getting clobbered on that.” And you end up making change. It’s a grassroots, juggernaut setting in that really changes things. I probably use that as much as any legislator. The way we were the architect of the PIPA-SOPA movement when all the power, all the money, was out trying to redesign the internet for the big guys. I organized a lot of grassroots groups, and [Sen.] Harry Reid set a date for a vote, and suddenly, 15 million texts and emails came in, and we beat all the money. You’re saying, “Do you see all of this happening yet?” When I was with the activists yesterday at the Treasury talking about trying to rein in Musk, I said, “This is really stunning.” This is less than five full days after I blew the whistle on the problem. And look, we got thousands of people and 30 legislators in the streets. So put me down as continuing to believe that citizens who mobilize can make a difference. That’s what I describe in the book. The book, for example, gives 12 rules, “Ron’s 12 Rules of Chutzpah,” that describe not just how people are looking at past examples, but how you can use the rules outlined in the book to make a difference. That was the first rule that we used yesterday: fight bad things, make a difference and speak out for good things, and above all, make noise. The book is really about pushing for progressive political change. You have a history of doing that. I think the question on everyone’s mind right now is when the other side doesn’t seem to care, and you can’t reach their constituents because they own the media platforms and their algorithms are driving all kinds of views that honestly just dismiss any concerns or turn the Democrats or any opposition at all into cartoon characters, how do you drive that kind of grassroots change? You have a lot of people who voted against their own interests here. They voted for cheaper egg prices and they’re getting Trump saying they’ll understand when terrorists drive prices up. Yeah, but they’re also catching up in a couple of weeks. Musk’s popularity numbers are really low. They’re finding out that Donald Trump tells them, “I am going to lower the prices of your groceries” — he said that point-blank — and then, he puts up a white flag of surrender a couple of weeks later and says, “Nope. Can’t do anything about it.” We’re going to build every single day between now and 2026 as many wins on the issues and matters people care about. It’s not sitting around and waiting. When we did that during the first term, we gained a few seats at the midterm. Two years later, we beat them all together. This is not going to be an easy walk in the park, but I’ve been part of efforts where I was able to beat incredible odds, which is what chutzpah is about. Chutzpah is about being bold, taking on big odds, and reaching out and finding people with all points of view. That’s what we’re going to be doing. Can you do that when you don’t own the communications networks? Just to boil the question down. Elon Musk owns Starlink in a world where– I’m talking to you, and you guys get the message. That’s true. You guys get the message out, and this guy’s working to make these changes that we’re talking about. He’s got a book that tells you how you can do more of it. There you go. I hate to hammer on it, but you can see the bigger picture. You have a Brendan Carr at the FCC putting pressure on legacy broadcast media. You have a Mark Zuckerberg and an Elon Musk telling their algorithms what to do, what kind of media to disseminate, and what’s acceptable speech and not. You have a TikTok sale in the offing that could go to a Trump loyalist. Is there an alternative media? Do you look at Bluesky and say, “Okay, decentralize social media. Provide a necessary check.” I’m on Bluesky. I love it. But if you want somebody who’s just going to say, “All I’m going to do all day is hang crepe because it’s hopeless,” I’m the wrong guy. I’m a 29-year-old Jewish kid who wanted to play in the NBA. That was a ridiculous idea. I got a scholarship, but I couldn’t get that dream, and I ended up being one of the youngest people elected to Congress by beating an incumbent. Guess who else did that not very long ago? [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], again, beating incredible odds. So, you’re talking about ways where you can really make a difference and beat the odds. Frankly, it takes a lot of chutzpah to do it. People say it’s hard to beat the powerful and the money, but I just gave you some examples of doing it. There’s a big split right now in the tech community. You have a lot of regular workers at the big tech companies who are horrified at what’s happening, and then you have their bosses who all showed up, sat at the inauguration, and are trying to get various things out of the Trump administration. As you said, I think they realize they can just write checks and get what they want. But their interests are not aligned. I don’t think Tim Cook’s interests and Mark Zuckerberg’s interests are aligned. I don’t even think they like each other. I don’t know if Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk like each other. I think they’re pretty ferociously competitive about their rockets and general cowboy demeanors. Is that a split that you see that can be exploited for political gain here? That the interests of tech, which has now taken over, are not actually aligned? If you look at the chutzpah rule, you say you’ll work with anybody regardless of political philosophy to get the public interest. I think that if Trump equals chaos, we’ve got more to work with than people think. Have you heard from that constituency at all? From the big tech companies? What I have heard from their executives, very directly, is that they thought the Biden administration hated them, that they could not work with Biden at all. They couldn’t even get the meetings they needed or meetings with the right people. What they generally got was, “We’re going to break you up,” and then there were a lot of lawsuits aimed at breaking them up. What you might still get out of the Trump administration is, “We’ll break you up, but you might be able to buy your way out of it.” Let me tell you what I think a bunch of these big tech companies are saying. Yes, they didn’t like the policies of the Biden administration, but they’re seeing more and more particularly young people — you see it in schools, on TikTok, and the like — who want to have their own businesses. They want to be entrepreneurs. They want to be the future. I think that big businesses who don’t pay attention to the small guys that have ideas and creative approaches are making a mistake because that’s who I’m throwing in with. I’m throwing in with the little guys because I think they can make a big, big difference. Biden was a big opponent of mine in technology for 30 years. I don’t think that the Democratic Party is about being for Big Tech. I think being for small business is going to be the future of the Democratic Party. In fact, small businesses and users. The two people that I fought for in the tech space are going to be my vision for the Democratic Party going forward. You can count on that. Is there any lesson you took away from DeepSeek? The big tech companies are spending or want to spend enormous amounts of money on data centers, on energy– The real message is how important open source is. Open source communications have got to be in the ballgame. I’ve continued to push them through all my time in public life, and it’s even more important today than it was. The other lesson there is that restricting chips to China didn’t work. The Chinese companies were able to take somewhat underpowered Nvidia chips, over-optimize them, and then outcompete. Because I think we’re wrapping up pretty soon, let me just mention that the Chinese are engaged in all kinds of abusive practices. Salt Typhoon, for example. The phone companies were supposed to have secured the phones 20 years ago, and I’ve been screaming my lungs out about it. I’ll be introducing another bill on this because when this latest set of breaches took place, a bunch of conservatives in the Congress said, “This is the biggest hack in American history.” Well, I’m going to make sure that we get another debate on this whole set of abuses. My bill will be going in soon. Salt Typhoon didn’t collect a lot of attention, but this is a massive breach of the American phone system. Stunning breach! The Biden administration was telling people to use secure and encrypted communications. Why do you think that went so unnoticed? I think that a bunch of the big companies you mentioned, like Microsoft, all said that they were taking care of things and tried to lull people through it. It wasn’t until the Chinese actually got away with it that anybody woke up and said, “Oh my goodness Mildred, we’ve got a problem.” On the same note, the notion that we would ban them from having our chips and that would keep them from competing in AI? I don’t know if that worked. I am looking at DeepSeek and saying, “Well, constraint breeds creativity. They got really creative, and they built a cheaper model that performs as well as our most expensive models.” Do you think that it’s time to rethink that approach to technology limitation? I think that’s a fair judgment. We understand that we have national security interests, and we’re certainly trying to compete with these people all over the world. And rethinking this is a sensible idea. We can’t stop China from getting chips, but we can certainly notice if it’s more expensive. We can make it more expensive. To bring that all the way back around to the top. Elon Musk, who may or may not be running part of our government, has significant ties to China. It’s a huge market for Tesla. You’ll hear a bit more from me on this very soon. Can you give us a preview? Nope. I’ve got to go through all the security rules and all the rest, but you’ll hear more about it soon. Do you think whatever you have to reveal will provide the necessary momentum to stop the chaos run of Elon Musk through the government? I think people are going to pay attention to it. It’ll be an important part of the debate. Sen. Wyden, I think we’re out of time. Thank you so much for being on Decoder. This was great. Thank you for letting me ask that question so bluntly at the top as well. No, I appreciate it. You guys, really care about policy issues, and thank goodness. I’m going to ask you for your advice, and I mean this sincerely. Last question. The Verge has always only cared about policy issues. This has been a thing that we say. We write about policy, not politics, because policy is important to people. It’s real. But it seems, here in 2025, politics and policy are the same thing. Do you feel that? It certainly makes me reflect on the policy that I’ve always said. It comes up at town hall meetings all the time. I say, “The best politics is good policy because you get in a position to be able to win people over for the right reasons. The reality is that these are really serious questions that don’t lend themselves to quick thought. We have to be ready to babble on both fronts. Let’s get the best policy ideas that we can and then work like hell to have the grassroots support in order to get them passed. But here’s my pushback. It seems like right now, the politics are winning. The politics are about collecting as much attention, being as loud on social media, and being as “authentic” as you can be. That lets you do whatever harebrained policy idea you want, including announcing a takeover of Gaza from the White House. That feels like a meaningful split. How do you bring that back into alignment? I’m going to continue to say that it’s possible to make this temporary and we can move on. But it’s only going to come about with good ideas and political organizing that will have to mobilize people all across the country. I mean, you can’t fake the price of eggs. Donald Trump’s got a problem, and if we pound that issue, a specific policy matter… I am going to talk until I run out of larynx space about him saying he was going to lower food prices and then putting up the white flag of surrender two weeks later. Now, the homeowner is worried about the price of eggs and you can’t fake that stuff. We’re going to do the best policy and work like hell to make sure people know about it. This last campaign was particularly hard because we made a big candidate change very late in the game, and it’s pretty hard to get your issues out that way, and we can do better. Sen. Wyden, I’ll let you get back to work. It sounds like you have a lot to do. We’ll talk to you soon. Thanks. A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.

Title: IT unemployment hits new high as AI threat continues

AI is causing tech sector layoffs, report claims When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New Wall Street Journal reporting has revealed an alarming trend within the tech sector – much like sceptics anticipated years ago, artificial intelligence looks to be displacing human workers and leading to higher unemployment rates. The report found IT sector unemployment rates rose from 3.9% in December to 5.7% in January, or from 98,000 to 152,000 Janco Associates analysis of the US Department of Labor data. More broadly, 143,000 new jobs were added in January 2025 to the US economy, albeit at a slower rate than optimal. In fact, white-collar and knowledge workers are seen as the most at-risk when it comes to AI-induced job displacement. Jaco Associates CEO Victor Janulaitis commented: “Jobs are being eliminated within the IT function which are routine and mundane, such as reporting, clerical administration.” Companies are also reducing their reliance on programmers and system designers in the hope that artificial intelligence can deliver further cost savings. The number of software development job posts dropped 8.5% year-over-year in January 2025. Although last year's pattern was considerably lower than 2023, when layoffs.fyi tracked 264,000 tech sector redundancies, as estimated 152,000 tech workers still lost their jobs in 2024 – nearly as many as the 165,000 workers who lost their jobs in 2022. Recent notable job losses include Sonos (12% of its headcount), Meta (5%), Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The report also suggests that further corporate investment in artificial intelligence could serve as an early sign that future job cuts could come – a trend described as “cost avoidance.” However, while certain jobs may be at risk, others remain in high demand. The report reveals that certain in-person and skilled roles are in greater demand than many white-collar positions – the 'in-person' element of that trend is particularly interesting, given the widespread return-to-office mandates that have been enacted post-pandemic. It's not all bad news though – Janulaitis revealed that January’s figures, which paint a negative picture for the year ahead, could indeed be artificially inflated by many companies who are looking to implement this year’s cost-cutting measures now, rather than later. Regardless, with a further 10,800 job cuts actioned in the first five weeks of 2025 across the industry, many workers are faced with an uncertain future.

Title: Shock and Awe Miscellany, 2/10/25

President Trump has been thinking outside the box, unleashing Elon Musk with his army of young tech prodigies, and doing what he said he would. His opponents are overwhelmed, and even his supporters cannot always get their heads around what he is doing. So here is a special Shock and Awe Miscellany. . . Do we really want Gaza? How can tariffs help our economy? Slashing the government. President Trump has had his eye on Canada and Greenland, hoping to make America great again by means of territorial acquisition. Whether or not that should be pursued, I can see the attraction of Greenland, with its immense mineral wealth and strategic location, and Canada, a developed Western nation that would be the equivalent in population and liberalism of a California North. But now the president has another territory he would like for the United States to have: Gaza, the 25 mile long by 3.7 to 7.5 mile wide strip of land bordering Israel, the Mediterranean Sea, and Egypt. Which is the site of the bloody war between Israel and Hamas. My question is, WHY? After a meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, who is open to the idea, President Trump said this, according to the transcript: “I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there and frankly who’s been really very unlucky. It’s been very unlucky. It’s been an unlucky place for a long time. “Being in its presence just has not been good and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there. Instead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly bad luck. “This can be paid for by neighbouring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and we’ll make sure something really spectacular is done. “They’re going to have peace. They’re not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilisation of wonderful people has had to endure. The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative. It’s right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually every building is down. “They’re living under fallen concrete that’s very dangerous and very precarious. They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony instead of having to go back and do it again. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area … do a real job, do something different. America’s top three trading partners, combining both imports and exports, are Mexico ($798 billion), Canada ($773 billion), and China ($575 billion). Together, they account for 42% of America’s trade. Last week, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on goods coming in from China. Those countries have vowed to retaliate with tariffs against American products. The reason the president gave for hitting our allies, with whom we have a free trade agreement negotiated by President Trump himself, over twice as hard as our adversary China, is that Mexico and Canada are not doing enough to stop illegal immigrants from crossing their borders into the U.S. Also that those porous borders are letting in the deadly drug Fentanyl. At this action, the stock market plunged, since the U.S. economy is highly dependent on world trade, both imports for our supply chains and consumer goods and exports, to sell U.S. products. But by the end of the week, both Mexico and Canada agreed to put 10,000 troops along the border to deter illegal immigrants and Fentanyl smuggling. So the president paused the tariffs for 30 days. So perhaps the threat of the tariffs was just the president throwing the nation’s weight around, a way to force countries to comply with our demands. And yet, President Trump likes tariffs, calling them “the greatest things ever invented,” and the duty on China’s products remains and is likely to go higher. (He earlier proposed a 60% tariff on China.) My question is, how would it be possible to implement such tariffs without triggering massive inflation? Importers always add the duty fees to the cost of the product. That would inflate the prices of just about everything Americans buy on Walmart and Amazon. But that’s not all. If tariffs are successful in limiting the amount of imports, so that more people “buy American,” the drop in overall supply plus the greater demand for domestically-produced goods will also send prices higher. The hope is that tariffs will help American manufacturing, but American industries are highly dependent on other countries for raw materials and parts necessary for their supply line. In time, the American economy could probably adjust, but that will take a long and painful time. Meanwhile, the loss of foreign markets for American products can only mean hard times for our companies, layoffs for our workers, and hardship for our farmers. Is there a way that high tariffs (traditionally a policy favored by liberal Democrats) could possibly help the American economy? To his credit, President Trump is slashing the overgrown federal government. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is decimating the federal work force and is eliminating entire agencies. To those who complain that no one elected Musk, I would say that no one elected the IRS agent who collected my taxes or the TSA agent who screened me at the airport. They were simply acting by virtue of the authority given to them by the Executive Branch of the government, under the auspices of the President of the United States. Musk is acting on the authority of the democratically-elected president, who is the head of said Executive Branch. One casualty was the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was completely eliminated, with its foreign aid function transferred to the State Department. Observes John Daniel Davidson, “In the six decades since it was established, USAID has gone from fighting poverty, spreading American ideals, and undercutting Soviet propaganda, to becoming a woke propaganda operation of its own that actively undermines the pillars of western civilization. . . .Everywhere you look in the USAID database, you see projects promoting LGBTQ ideology, mass immigration, multiculturalism, DEI, climate change-ism, and the like. You see programs that undermine the traditional family, that enable anti-free speech censorship, that strive to make the rest of the world just like urban liberal enclaves in the U.S.” He cites some of the grants: “$70,000 for a ‘DEI musical’ in Ireland, $47,000 for a ‘transgender opera’ in Colombia, $32,000 for a ‘transgender comic book’ in Peru, and $1.5 million for an LGBT jobs program in Serbia.” (Go here for more.) In a bigger move, all federal workers were offered a buyout of eight months severance and benefits. If they don’t, they risk losing their jobs as part of a reduction in force. So far, some 60,000 have accepted, about 3% of the federal workforce, though the overall goal is to cut the number of employees by 5%-10%. One agency offering buyouts to its entire workforce is the CIA. Though most national security personnel were exempt from the cutbacks, the new CIA Director John Ratcliffe decided to apply it to his clandestine domain. Granted, that institution has been guilty of hugely consequential intelligence failures (e.g., Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan) and scandalous political interventions (e.g., the Russiagate scandal, the Hunter Biden laptop coverup). A house cleaning is certainly in order. But if some agents or their handlers decide to take early retirement from their dangerous work, can we risk losing our spy networks in places like China, Russia, and Iran? Shouldn’t the pruning, for the CIA and elsewhere, be more targeted? UPDATE: A federal judge has paused the buyouts.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, will begin issuing layoff notices starting today. These job cuts, referred to as 'performance terminations,' will primarily target the lowest-performing 5% of employees. Unlike previous layoffs, Meta plans to keep its offices open on the day of the cuts and will not release a company-wide statement. #News Meta to lay off about 4,000 employees due to poor performance Social media giant #Meta will reportedly layoff 3,600 employees this year, according to recent filings.

Notifications will be sent to staff across over a dozen countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa between February 11 and February 18.

In a memo, these cuts were labeled as “performance terminations,” a term initially reported by The Information. Unlike prior company-wide layoffs, Meta will keep its offices open on Monday and will not provide additional details about the decisions, according to a memo from Janelle Gale, Meta’s Head of People. In a separate memo posted on Friday, Peng Fan, Meta’s VP of Engineering for Monetization, urged employees to support an expedited hiring process for machine learning engineers and other "business-critical" engineering roles. This accelerated hiring initiative is set to run from February 11 to March 13. Meta decided to layoff 3,600 employees citing low-performance. On the surface, it is about efficiency.

Google initiated a voluntary exit program in its U.S. Platforms and Devices team, affecting Android and Pixel. Microsoft focused on performance-based terminations, some without severance. Amazon cut 200 jobs in fashion and fitness divisions, realigning its North America Stores team. Stripe laid off 300 employees in product, engineering, and operations, despite plans to grow its workforce by 17% by year-end. Robinhood's media arm, Sherwood, also downsized as part of a restructuring.

Title: ‘It was intentional’: Dollar Tree shopper walks to Coca-Cola shelf. Then she notices a sign

Stace Fernandez Coca-Cola is being boycotted as people accuse the soda giant of being racist and anti-immigrant. But are the claims true? Coca-Cola has branded itself as the drink that brings people together and puts a smile on your face. But people have begun to question the brand as rumors swirl about how they treat employees. In a viral video with more than 250,000 views, content creator Juju (@jujubluebear) shared something she noticed in a dollar store. As Juju walked the aisles of her local Dollar Tree, she immediately stopped and stared at the Coca-Cola display. On the shelf with the unrefrigerated drinks was a small sign that read, “Don’t forget the ICE.” It seems innocuous at first, but then it clicks that Juju thinks this is a reference not to literal ice but to ICE, aka Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Well, well, well, look what we have here. [Expletive] Coca-Cola. Don’t forget the ICE? Yeah, I [expletive] bet Coca-Cola. [Expletive] you,” Juju said. “U knew damn well what u were doing putting that sign right there,” Juju added in the caption. Part of why Juju implies that Coca-Cola and Dollar Tree are promoting ICE is because of a rumor that’s swirling about Coke laying off undocumented immigrants en masse and calling ICE on them. But it could also just be that the store is trying to upsell people to buy ice with their unrefrigerated drinks. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. (FYI, Coca-Cola did donate to Trump.) Coca-Cola was added to this list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. If there were, major news outlets would be picking up on this story. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. On deportations: “If Coca-Cola had thousands of undocumented employees, that would mean the company knowingly hired illegal workers — only to then snitch on itself by calling ICE?” Distractify stated. “It’s not just unlikely, it’s illogical.” “Love whoever put that sign, cus you know very da.mn well it was intentional to remind everyone!” a top comment read. “I work at dollar tree those ice signs been there as long as they sold ice bags . pan the video to the right where the Pepsi end cap is. same signs,” a person said. “Pepsi forever. [Expletive] Coca-Cola,” another wrote. The Daily Dot reached out to Juju for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Dollar Tree and Coca-Cola via email.

Title: The New Yorker magazine's first hundred years

Watch CBS News By Kelefa Sanneh Updated on: February 12, 2025 / 9:08 PM EST / CBS News The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. "1978," he said. "I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came." Asked his title, Diones replied , "I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around." "An expert on both the people and the magazine?" "That's right." "You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?" "Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!" he laughed. The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting. One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. "We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff." The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. "All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work," Diones said. Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse. "At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley," said editor David Remnick. "Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery." Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society. In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, "It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque." I asked, "What did he have against Iowa?" "I don't know," Remnick laughed. "To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles …" The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. "We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque," Remnick said. "It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking." Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers – more than two dozen. So, what is a fact-checker? "Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be," McIntosh said. "Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out," I said. "I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us," McIntosh laughed. And everything gets checked – not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. "He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'" she recalled. "And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic." "But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny," I said. "Not pithy enough, no," said Mathew. "All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'" Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow. The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month. So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, "It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in." "Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?" "I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure," said Remnick. "Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?" "No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging." These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, "How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation – four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine." For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: "He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers." One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: "Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them." In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in. I said, "maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?" "That's right, and I'm in it now," laughed Diones. "And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it." For more info: Story produced by Mary Raffalli. Editor: George Pozderec. EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Teresa Mathew, associate director of The New Yorker's fact checking department. We regret the error.

Title: Meta to Begin Previously Announced Workforce Reduction

Meta is set to begin its previously announced workforce reduction on Monday (Feb. 10). The company told staff on Friday (Feb. 7) that those who are laid off will be cut off from Meta’s internal system within an hour and notified about their severance packages via email, The Information reported Friday. CNBC reported on Jan. 14 that Meta planned to cut about 5% of its “low performers,” as the move was described in internal messages from company executives, and that the employees affected by the cuts would be notified Feb. 10. Meta has more than 72,000 employees. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in one of the internal messages, per the report: “Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.” Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce reportedly planned or made layoffs during the first weeks of 2025. It was reported Tuesday (Feb. 4) that Salesforce is eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company. On Jan. 29, it was reported that Amazon was laying off dozens of people in its communication department. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said the move aimed to “help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers.” Microsoft reportedly plans to pause hiring in part of its U.S. consulting business and said in January that it would lay off less than 1% of its workforce. The hiring pause is reportedly part of the Microsoft consulting division’s efforts to manage costs. As for Meta, it was reported Thursday (Feb. 6) the company could pull the plug on its metaverse efforts. Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees in Reality Labs — the home of its metaverse and wearables products — that “this year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Meta goes to war with leakers

A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. A culture fight is playing out inside the social media giant. Also: DOGE inefficiency and more layoffs. by Alex Heath During a Q&A with employees earlier this week, one of Meta’s top executives gave an ominous warning. After lamenting “a tremendous number of leaks” from inside the company, CTO Andrew Bosworth said that, while he didn’t want to “ruin the surprises,” the company was “making progress on catching people.” Since Mark Zuckerberg’s comments at a recent all-hands meeting were published, Meta’s leaders have tried to clamp down on an agitated and tense cohort of workers. The power struggle isn’t over. It’s unclear how Meta is going to look on the other side. “There’s a funny thing that’s happening with these leaks,” Bosworth said during his Q&A earlier this week (a recording of which I obtained). “When things leak, I think a lot of times people think, ‘Ah, okay, this is leaked, therefore it’ll put pressure on us to change things.’ The opposite is more likely.” “This is a company that, from Mark’s inception, as far as I can tell, has always played the repeat game,” he said. “And if you create an environment where leaks cause people to make things change internally, then it creates more leaks. You create an incentive structure that’s wrong… I think that’s a thing that we should change. I think we probably will at some point but I don’t know when that’s going to be.” Like any company with tens of thousands of employees, Meta is not a monolith. There are still true believers and those who also do their best to just tune out the drama. But there are also reasons for concern: Employees are on edge about Zuckerberg’s next round of “low-performer” layoffs that are arriving on Monday. And many are still reeling from his politically-charged changes to content moderation and DEI programs. The disconnect between that group of concerned employees and upper management was on full display during Bosworth’s Q&A earlier this week. At one point, he responded to a question from a female employee on Zuckerberg’s widely-circulated comment to Joe Rogan about wanting more “masculine energy” in the workplace. The employee asked Bosworth to respond to Zuckerberg saying that companies need “less feminine energy.” Zuckerberg never technically said that in the interview with Rogan, though one could easily interpret the “masculine energy” soundbite to mean that the CEO wants a more specific kind of energy at the expense of the other. Bosworth went off. “This really bothered me because it’s evident from your question that you did not actually listen to the thing you are criticizing or asking questions about. And that is not acceptable. I don’t know why people think it’s an okay thing to take something laundered through a biased source construct and bring it here without even bothering to look at anything that is free and online.” “He wants us to be a place that supports all people,” he continued. “He says that in the interview and then you come in here and you haven’t even bothered to listen to the thing. It’s like three minutes. It wouldn’t take you that long. So, you can tell from your question [that] you didn’t even read it. You didn’t even listen to it. You just read something online and got real mad about it. You’ve been mad about it for weeks, obviously. For weeks, you’ve been mad about it. It’s crazy.” Some noteworthy job changes in the tech world: If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line, all of our reporting, and an improved ad experience on the web.
