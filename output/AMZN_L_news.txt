“The first step onto the corporate ladder is vanishing for many new graduates,” argued a recent Fortune report. As a result, CEOs are warning that entry-level jobs are on the brink of extinction, with internships and opportunities for college graduates drying up. Of course, not everyone will feel the impact in the same way. At the top of the pyramid are investors, entrepreneurs, and elite programmers who now command salaries on par with professional athletes. But artificial intelligence — fuelled by a huge infusion of Wall Street cash — threatens to eliminate many software jobs, along with high-end professional roles that involve routine analysis. Young people are acutely aware of this. In the class I teach with Marshall Koplansky at Chapman University, several students predicted that the jobs they currently hold will soon disappear. Among them were a game designer, two human-resources executives, and a manufacturing and warehouse manager. My engineering colleagues report a similar trend. While opportunities remain strong for mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as for those designing robotics, the outlook is far less certain for computer science students. Despite soaring profits at the largest tech companies, AI programming tools have enabled sweeping layoffs at firms such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Today, among college graduates aged 22-27, computer science and computer engineering majors face some of the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In response, many firms are now focusing on building tangible products rather than merely shifting algorithms for commerce or generating more social media. In the aerospace and defence sectors, for example, AI is seen not as an end but a tool. It is a means to enhance human creativity and productivity rather than replace it. “Software is not in the greatest position with AI,” Delian Asparouhov, who runs a firm focused on in-space manufacturing, told me. “Now people are shifting to hard tech. Designing and building spaceships still needs people.” This could spell trouble for elite universities, but represents a major advantage for schools that teach the practical skills companies actually need. So far, these opportunities are largely concentrated in red and purple states in the Midwest and South — the regions most focused on reshoring manufacturing and other industries from overseas. Attitudes are shifting alongside these economic changes. One recent survey found that roughly 83% of Generation Z feel that learning a skilled trade can be a better pathway to economic security than college — including 90% of those already holding college degrees. Indeed, as college enrolment has dropped between 2020 and 2023, trade school enrolment grew by 10%. These changes suggest that as practical skills gain value, regions offering them are likely to attract both talent and jobs. Read the rest of this piece at: UnHerd.

Let HR Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, HR may want to prioritize L&D and agitate for a bigger budget next year. After several years of an employee-friendly economy, the pivot back to an employer’s market may feel like whiplash for many workers. Anxiety is up, and employees are fumbling for security in a time of widespread layoffs and shrinking opportunity. Benefits and salary budgets generally have stagnated, and employers have seemingly pared back learning and development as well. Respondents to HR Dive’s Identity of HR survey said training had dropped in importance at their organization, with only 5% saying it was a top priority this year, compared to 12% last year. As a result, recruiters have been looking for highly qualified candidates to fill certain roles, while some say overlooked talent can’t access the learning opportunities that might help them rise into those positions — creating a catch-22. AI skills have commanded much of the conversation around training, and reports have shown that few employers are investing in learning programs on the topic. A July report from BambooHR found roughly one-third of employers have offered such training, and a May report from Amazon Web Services showed many employers don’t even know what such training would look like. Between the need for skilled workers and employee demand for training, some HR professionals have shifted from a recruiting focus to one of retention and development; those eyeing a similar path may need to agitate for a bigger L&D budget next year. Concerned about the encroachment of AI on entry-level opportunities, Gen Z has shown it will particularly prioritize employers who can offer skill-building and continuous learning opportunities, with more than half of Gen Z workers telling Flexa as much.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: 350,000 Black Women Were Ousted From The Workforce—For Millennials, Where Are They Going Next?

Time Published: 2025-08-25T22:42:24Z
Full Content:
ByJasmine Browley, Contributor. As I’ve stated time and time again, millennials know how to hustle. From the time we reached our formative years, our identities were melded into our professions. So imagine what happens when our merit is systemically attacked at a government level. When the most recent jobs report revealed that 350,000 Black women had left the labor force, I resisted the instinct to call those exits voluntary. “I personally term that as being ousted,” I told the experts I interviewed, “because a lot of those exits were not optional.” Behind that staggering number are women who are losing not only paychecks but also the stability, health access, and professional pathways that keep families and communities afloat. What happens next for them? Some are rebuilding through entrepreneurship, others are demanding systemic reforms, and all are navigating the intersection of workforce inequity and personal resilience. “Job loss directly translates into reduced income and potentially a loss of health insurance,” explained Fade Adetosoye, who helped lead a recent McKinsey study on Black maternal health and workforce participation. “That makes it harder for women to afford prenatal and postpartum care, medications, and services for conditions like gestational diabetes or hypertension—things that disproportionately impact Black women.” The ripple effects are profound. McKinsey’s research estimates that addressing the Black maternal health gap could add $25 billion to the U.S. economy annually and save $385 billion in healthcare costs. Without intervention, Black mothers lose an average of 14–15 healthy days per year for the rest of their lives due to childbirth-related conditions. “We’re talking 350,000 healthy years lost that women could be spending participating in the economy, investing in their families and communities,” Adetosoye told me. Her conclusion is stark: “The gold standard for birthing people should not be survival. It should be thriving. And there is absolutely a tie between Black maternal health disparities and economic mobility.” For Michelda Castro, the ousting wasn’t theoretical. She had climbed through finance and government program management roles, even overseeing a $69 million loan fund for underserved communities. But repeated experiences with bias, systemic barriers, and finally, layoffs tied to shifting federal priorities, left her searching for something more sustainable. “I was stressed, having panic attacks at work, working 60, 70 hours a week,” she recounted to me. “They told me I was doing a great job, but when the director role opened up—the one I’d been running for nine months—they didn’t even give me an interview. Then they asked me to train the white man they hired instead.” After another corporate stint ended in layoffs due to federal grant cuts handed down by the Trump administration, Castro leaned fully into entrepreneurship. More than a decade ago, she founded Versatile Image, a nonprofit that hosts the Unity Block Party in Utah, an annual cultural and economic festival that now generates over $100,000 in revenue. With the layoff, she focused renewed energy and focus into making the once side hustle into her full-time career. Still, she says the uphill climb is relentless: federal grants have been slashed and are continuing to be so, corporate sponsors have pulled out due to DEI alignment concerns, and banks remain reluctant to extend capital. “If I were a white man, the struggle would be glamorized—like starting Amazon in a garage,” she said. “But when it’s a Black woman, people call it complaining.” The broader context, says Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families and co-leader of the 75 Million Campaign, is that today’s job losses are less about performance and more about politics. “When you lose a job not because of your work but because of a political agenda, it can feel demoralizing,” Frye told me. “And for Black women, particularly Black mothers—more than 80% of whom are the primary breadwinners—it threatens the stability of entire families.” She points to the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as both a cause and a consequence. “This administration has deployed a different narrative, but the purpose is the same as always: to erode the pathways that allowed Black women even a chance at the middle class,” Frye told me. Her call to action: don’t internalize the systemic failures. “This is not about individual deficiencies. It’s an ideological agenda. And we must push back—not only to protect jobs, but to protect the progress that got us here in the first place.” Despite the structural barriers, Black women continue to lead in entrepreneurship. According to American Express data, Black women are the fastest-growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the U.S., a trend likely to accelerate as traditional pathways constrict. “I don’t want to just survive pregnancy, or layoffs, or discrimination,” Adetosoye told me. “I want to thrive. And thriving means being able to build wealth, plan estates, and contribute fully to the economy.” Castro echoed the same sentiment, this time through the lens of her community. “When I couldn’t find joy in corporate America, I built it myself. That’s what the Unity Block Party is—it’s our refusal to be erased.” This year, she was sure to lean in on the joy element by tapping headliner Durand Bernard, a popular singer that often weaves messages of self-care in his songs. “I am so excited‚” Castro told me. “We need this happiness more than ever.” The exodus of 350,000 Black women from the labor force is more than a statistic—it’s a referendum on whether the U.S. economy values their contributions. For Adetosoye, Castro, and Frye, the answer is to build new systems: of care, of capital, of narrative. “Black women, especially younger generations, like millennials, are resilient,” Frye said. “But resilience should not be the requirement for survival in this economy. We deserve systems that work for us, not against us.”

August 25, 2025 10:14 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook.

After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Business Technology News: What’s In Microsoft Copilot’s GPT-5 Upgrade?

ByGene Marks, Contributor. Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them? As of August 7, GPT-5 – OpenAI’s most advanced AI model – is now integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio worldwide. Microsoft posted the announcement detailing the following capabilities: -Copilot now uses GPT-5’s real-time router to select the best model for each prompt –either a fast-response engine for simple tasks or a deep-reasoning engine for complex ones. -Its human-like capability mirrors how people think producing incisive feedback when tasks require it. -Copilot can review a project, provide a summary of what worked and what didn’t, and draft a “lessons learned” document. -Copilot can handle large documents up to 100K tokens. Microsoft said this update is available for users who have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license – availability to all users will roll out in the coming weeks. (Source: Microsoft) OpenAI has absorbed a fair amount of abuse for its rollout of GPT-5 in the past few weeks thanks to bugs and hallucinations. But the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, and like any new version of a software product, I’m confident the new platform will be more reliable in the coming months. Microsoft is already doubling down by incorporating into its Copilot offerings. If your company is using Copilot – be it for productivity or internal development – you’ll pretty much have no choice but to use the GPT-5 platform going forward. AI is reshaping the workforce often at the expense of employees according to CNBC’s report that compiled responses from management at companies like Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft. AI is being used to streamline operations, boost productivity, and reduce labor costs. AI tools are replacing roles in customer service, HR, finance, and software development, especially entry-level and repetitive jobs. PayPal’s AI assistant – for example – is cutting down on customer service calls and live interactions. Rising unemployment numbers in the tech sector have been voiced by young workers whose skills overlap with AI capabilities. Executives often frame layoffs as “restructuring” or “optimization,” though experts say these are often euphemisms for AI-driven cuts. AI is quietly becoming a powerful force behind workforce reductions, even as companies tout its benefits for efficiency and innovation. (Source: CNBC) Ever see an employee typing pool? Telephone switchboard operators? Gas station attendants? Blacksmiths? Technology has always replaced people. This is nothing new. In 2025 big companies are doing this, mainly by employing AI in customer service and software development. Ultimately this technology will make its way into operations, sales, marketing, accounting and right down on to the shop floor. Small businesses will follow. Labor will be disrupted. The smartest employees will lean into this stuff and use it well. Others will find themselves out of a job. I’m sure there will be other opportunities, just like there’s always been. Angus Loten of the Wall Street Journal reported on the surge in CEO impersonation scams fueled by AI. Last year alone, over 105,000 deepfake attacks were reported with losses exceeding $200 million. Cybercriminals are using AI-generated deepfakes – hyper-realistic video and audio – to impersonate CEOs and other executives. These scams typically begin with a phone call or video meeting from a fake executive making urgent requests for money transfers, sensitive data, or access credentials. The deepfakes are shockingly convincing, mimicking real voices, facial expressions, and body language in real time. Scammers train AI models using publicly available content – interviews, webinars, earnings calls – to replicate executives’ speech and appearance. The targets of these sophisticated scams are often lower-level employees with privileged access. (Source: Wall Street Journal) Another day, another security threat…this time from AI. Deepfakes are getting better at fooling people and will continue to be a rising threat. But there are some old school ways to defend against this. For example, always call the person back. Require multiple sign-offs on any cash transaction. Require additional documentation, even if it’s from the boss. Get training and have some common sense. DocuSign is evolving far beyond e-signatures with its new AI-powered Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, unveiled in August 2025. With IAM, DocuSign now helps users manage the entire agreement lifecycle – from request intake to execution – using AI and automation. The AI can flag risky or non-compliant terms based on company playbooks; suggest edits to align with internal policies; and centralize templates and audit trails for consistency and visibility. DocuSign Iris is an AI engine that selects the best model for tasks like contract review, compliance checks, and identity verification. This shift turns contracts from static documents into dynamic, searchable data assets, helping businesses reduce errors, accelerate deal cycles, and improve compliance. (Source: Computer Weekly) As a user of DocuSign, I need to take the advice that I often give to others: lean into your software platforms and get training. We’re still using this platform like we did five years ago. And yet, here are a bunch of ways that we could be doing things better if we only spent the time to learn them.

Title: 'The dumbest thing I've ever heard': Amazon Web Services CEO lambasts replacing junior employees with AI, but he still loves AI

AWS CEO Matt Garman spoke up for entry-level jobs, but still insists AI will change all jobs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In an interview with investor and AI evangelist Matthew Berman this week, AWS CEO Matt Garman shut down the idea that junior employees should be replaced by AI, calling it "the dumbest thing I've ever heard." "They're probably the least expensive employees you have, they're the most leaned in to your AI tools, and how's that going to work when you go, like, 10 years in the future and you have no one that has built up or learned anything? "My view is like, you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it." But overall, Garman still has the optimistic take on AI's impact on the job market you commonly see from tech executives. "I think AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company, and every single job," Garman said. "But it doesn't mean they go away. It has transformed them, not replaced them." He added that, "I'm not minimizing that uncertainty that people will have and I know people are worried about [AI] and I think one of the things is, embrace that technology. The more you can embrace that technology, be flexible, understand how it can help you do your job faster and better, [then] I think the better off people are going to be as they make that transition." It's somewhat refreshing to hear a tech CEO defend entry-level jobs, especially with some estimates showing some 50% of all entry-level office jobs could be eliminated by AI in the coming years. Unfortunately, these comments come just a month after hundreds of Amazon Web Services employees were laid off. Amazon explained the layoffs in a statement to Reuters, commenting: "These decisions are necessary as we continue to invest, hire, and optimize resources to deliver innovation for our customers." While that statement doesn't mention AI, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made comments back in June that seemed to hint that AI will be responsible for job elimination. Jassy said in an employee memo, "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company."

Title: A Microsoft veteran says declining morale and a 'culture shift' drove him to resign: 'The great flattening was definitely happening'

Phil Coachman loved working at Microsoft for most of his nearly decadelong tenure. But as the culture began to shift and layoffs piled up, he decided it was time to move on. He started looking for a new role in July 2024 when he was still at Microsoft, but struggled to get much traction. In January, he resigned from his role as a senior cloud solution architect to focus on his job search. "I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said the 44-year-old, who lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." Coachman said company layoffs — including the elimination of about 10,000 roles in 2023 — took a toll on his morale and that of his co-workers. He said he knew several people who were let go, including one teammate he regarded as a "top performer." "Every team that I worked with was just down," he said. "So now you go to work and everybody's depressed every day." Coachman is among the current and former Microsoft employees who have been affected by workforce reductions — either by losing a job or being left to adjust to coworker departures. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Coachman to switch jobs — or find new ones after they resign or are laid off. "It just got to a point where morale was no longer up to par," Coachman said, "and ultimately it got to a place where it was time to make a change." Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: After working as a Microsoft contractor for several years, Coachman joined the company full-time in 2015. He said he's extremely grateful for his time at the company, and that before joining, he was earning far less and just trying to get by. He'd be open to returning in the future, he said, if he saw signs of a positive culture shift. During his final years at Microsoft, Coachman said there appeared to be a push to reduce the number of managers in an effort to increase what the company calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager. While his own manager's number of direct reports didn't change during his time on the team, he said they are now working in an individual contributor role. He also said he saw the number of reports per manager increase on other teams. "I saw managers leave and other managers absorb that head count, so you go from managing 10 people to now maybe 18 people, which when you talk to those managers, becomes really hard," he said. "The great flattening was definitely happening." Beyond layoffs and shifts in management structure, Coachman said he also began being asked to focus more on performance metrics, which he felt came at the cost of flexibility and meaningful customer work. In recent years, Big Tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, have revamped their performance review and compensation structures to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Another key factor in his decision to resign was the uptick in business travel. He said he was on the road about three times a month — a return to pre-pandemic norms. "It just got to a point where I was missing too much of my kids' lives," he said, adding that his work frustrations made travel less tolerable. "It was different when I was traveling and the job was awesome." When Coachman started his job search in July 2024, he thought it was going to be fairly easy. There seemed to be plenty of job postings on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, so after pinpointing a few roles he felt qualified for, he figured he'd be able to get interviews and eventually land an offer. But he quickly realized it wouldn't be that simple. After all, US businesses were hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. "It was six months of basically just being ghosted," he said. "It was a completely different world than when I had applied to a job decades ago." Coachman said he went through several rounds of résumé tweaks — thinking the format might be the issue — but still got little response. As his job search dragged on, Coachman said he was hesitant to resign from his Microsoft job before having another role lined up because it would mean giving up a steady paycheck and unvested company stock. However, he said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel more comfortable. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." In early 2024, Coachman said he hired a life coach — in part to help him navigate the changes he was experiencing at work. He said the life coach helped him get confident in his decision to resign, adding that hiring them was maybe the "best investment" he'd ever made. After resigning, Coachman said he adjusted his job search strategy. Rather than simply applying for jobs, he spent more time tapping into the network he'd built over the years. He targeted roles at companies where he knew someone, then reached out to ask whether they thought he'd be a good fit — and if they'd be willing to refer him. In one instance, he saw a few open roles at the data analytics and AI startup Databricks, where a former Microsoft colleague of his worked. After reaching out, Coachman said they recommended he focus on one specific role that they'd be willing to refer him for. The next day, Coachman received a call from a company recruiter. After the interview process, he received an offer and started working for the company in April. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said. Coachman said his pay is comparable to what he earned at Microsoft, and that the signing bonus helped make up for what he left behind in unvested stock. He said his travel is also now limited to no more than once a month, which was a big factor in his decision to accept the offer. Over the course of his roughly nine-month job search, Coachman said he applied to hundreds of jobs and received two offers — one for his current role and another from a startup he turned down due to concerns about job security. His top advice for job seekers: build your network and lean on it. Rather than just connecting on LinkedIn, he said, it's better to have real conversations that help foster relationships. He said this could boost your chances of landing a referral down the road — giving your application the "personal touch" it might need to get past applicant tracking system scanners. "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference," he said. Jump to
