As Amazon started cutting 14,000 jobs, employees were informed that they had been relieved—through text messages. According to a report by Business Insider, the e-commerce giant sent two messages on Tuesday to inform employees that their jobs had been terminated. One of the two texts sent by Amazon to employees urged them to check their personal or official emails before reporting to work. The second text, meanwhile, directed employees to call a help desk in case they hadn't received "an email message about your role". According to people familiar with the matter, this rather unorthodox strategy of laying off employees was to ensure that people did not show up to work to find that their access badges no longer functioned. With most tech firm offices having badge-based access, this problem of terminated employees showing up to work, only to find their badges didn't work, had become a common occurrence during mass layoffs at Google and Tesla. After Reuters initially reported that Amazon was slated to cut 30,000 jobs, the Jeff Bezos-led firm clarified that 14,000 job cuts were indeed underway. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti said in a blog post on Tuesday. In an internal email accessed by BI, the Amazon HR chief also said that laid off employees would be supported with full pay and benefits for 90 days after being relieved. "We didn't make these decisions lightly, and we're committed to supporting you throughout this transition, which will include a non-working period with full pay and benefits (as applicable), an offer of a severance package, transitional benefits as applicable by country, and access to several skills trainings as well as external job placement support," the email read. Notably, the layoffs came months after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned about AI taking jobs in the e-commerce giant. Building on Jassy's warning, Galetti has also hinted of more layoffs in the near future. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before," the Amazon HR chief said. "Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains," Galetti added. The last major round of company-wide layoffs at Amazon took place three years ago, and was implemented over five months.

Title: The Evolution of Layoffs: A Corporate Love Story

There was a time when layoffs felt like failure.A bruising, reluctant move. A last resort.Now? They’re a business model , a recurring ritual in the quarterly earnings liturgy.A cleansing ceremony to reassure investors that “discipline” still rules. Let’s rewind. 2020 changed everything.Or so we thought. As the world shut down, companies broadcast empathy from their home offices:“Due to unprecedented uncertainty, we’re forced to make tough decisions.”Translation: It’s not you. It’s margins. Millions were laid off “for the greater good.” That “good” turned out to be the balance sheet.When markets rebounded and stock valuations hit record highs, the same companies discovered a new crisis: “overhiring.” The solution? Another wave of layoffs. Corporate resilience, it seemed, meant the CEO’s yacht stayed afloat. The numbers glittered.Microsoft posted billions in profit yet cut 9,000 jobs (Q1 2025 filings).UPS, fresh off a record delivery year, said goodbye to 20,000 employees in a “realignment initiative.”Intel trimmed 4,000 under “manufacturing optimization.”Tata Consultancy Services bragged about its “biggest-ever workforce restructuring” — 12,261 people, gone. Nestle plans to get rid of 12,000 white collar jobs on top of 4,000 other roles across the board within the next two years Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts The list goes on and on. The paradox became routine: profits up, payroll down.Somewhere, HR pressed send on another “Exciting Changes Ahead” email. Growth, it turns out, is only good news for shareholders. 2025 brought a shiny new excuse: artificial intelligence.Executives announced “transformative investments in AI,” often right before announcing job cuts. IBM, Dell, and Google cited “AI-driven efficiencies” across multiple reports. But in practice, AI wasn’t replacing tasks … it was replacing justification.PowerPoints got smarter; human beings, redundant. As one HR chief joked at an investor meeting, “We’re not downsizing … we’re future-sizing.” Bad economy? Layoffs.Booming economy? Layoffs.AI revolution? Layoffs.Solar eclipse? Pending. In March 2025 alone, U.S. companies slashed 275,000 jobs … the largest monthly wave since 2009 (Challenger, Gray & Christmas report). Corporate America doesn’t need a crisis anymore. It just needs a quarter. The language evolved.Layoffs became “rightsizing.”Cuts became “strategic agility.”Suffering became “efficiency gains.” Executives now speak with Zen minimalism about “optimizing workforce alignment,” as if people were spreadsheet cells misbehaving.They talk about “doing more with less.”Mostly, the less is us. Somewhere along the way, we lost basic math: People are the economy.Consumers need income.Income comes from jobs … the ones being systematically deleted. You can’t fire your way to prosperity.You can’t automate empathy.And you definitely can’t build a thriving society by erasing its workforce one “optimization” at a time. Still, somewhere at sea, a CEO raises a glass aboard his yacht … Synergy II ….smiling as he tells investors,“We’re doing great things with less.”He’s not wrong.They’re doing great things.With less of us.

Title: The Fed is expected to cut interest rates as job market shows signs of weakness

Scott Horsley Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues cut their benchmark interest rate by a quarter point Wednesday in an effort to prop up the sagging job market. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images North America hide caption The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point Wednesday, as policymakers work to shore up the softening job market. It was the Fed's second rate cut in six weeks, after holding rates steady for much of the year in an effort to curb stubborn inflation. Prices are still climbing faster than the central bank would like, but for now, policymakers are more concerned with preventing a big jump in unemployment. A number of prominent corporations have announced job cuts in recent days. Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate positions. (Amazon is a financial supporter of NPR and pays to distribute some of our content.) Target said last week it's cutting about 1000 corporate jobs and leaving another 800 jobs unfilled. And the federal government cut about 100,000 jobs in the first eight months of the year, with many more workers expected to drop off the federal payroll in October. The vote to cut interest rates by a quarter point was not unanimous. The newest Fed governor, Stephen Miran, would have preferred a larger, half-point cut, while Jeffrey Schmid, who heads the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, would have preferred to leave rates unchanged. The Fed's job has been complicated by the government shutdown, which has choked off much of the official data used to track the economy. A report on September's job gains is nearly a month overdue. And there's a question about whether October's job growth will be tallied at all. Loading... The Labor Department did produce one official economic report last week, showing inflation in September was slightly milder than forecasters had expected. That reinforced the idea that inflation concerns should take a backseat to worries about faltering job growth. "My focus is on the labor market," Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this month. "Payroll gains have weakened this year and employment may well be shrinking already." Waller says that while President Trump's tariffs are putting some upward pressure on prices, he does not expect long-lasting effects on inflation. In the absence of official government data, analysts are looking to alternative tea leaves for signs of which way the economy is moving. On Tuesday, the payroll processing company ADP reported a modest uptick in private-sector hiring during the four weeks ending in mid-October. ADP's jobs numbers often differ, however, from the official government tallies. "We're seeing some improvement, but that improvement is tepid, and it is preliminary," said ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson. "As the weeks progress, we might see further weakness." So long as workers are earning paychecks, they can continue to spend, but if job growth stalls and layoffs jump, that could become a drag on the broader economy. "The reason why consumers have been so resilient is the labor market has been relatively strong," Richardson says. "It's not glorious. Some of the momentum that we saw early in the year has slowed down. But overall we are seeing enough strength to keep consumer spending steady." Unemployment inched up over the summer, but there's been no official tally of the unemployment rate for September or October. That's led Waller to rely more heavily on anecdotal reports from business contacts, which offers a mixed picture. "Employers indicate to me that there was some further softening in the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid spending," Waller said. Much of that spending may be driven by wealthy Americans who are less dependent on weekly paychecks, but a clearer picture will not be available until the government resumes releasing economic data.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, file) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year as it seeks to shore up economic growth and hiring, even as inflation stays elevated. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell also cautioned that further rate cuts weren’t guaranteed, citing the government shutdown’s interruption of economic reports and sharp divisions among 19 Fed officials who participate in the central bank’s interest-rate deliberations. Speaking to reporters after the Fed announced its rate decision, Powell said there were “strongly differing views about how to proceed in December” at its next meeting and a further reduction in the benchmark rate is not “a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The rate cut — a quarter of a point — brings the Fed’s key rate down to about 3.9%, from about 4.1%. The central bank had cranked its rate to roughly 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 to combat the biggest inflation spike in four decades before implementing three cuts last year. Lower rates could, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as for business loans. The move comes amid a fraught time for the central bank, with hiring sluggish and yet inflation stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Compounding its challenges, the central bank is navigating without the economic signposts it typically relies on from the government, including monthly reports on jobs, inflation, and consumer spending, which have been suspended because of the government shutdown. Financial markets largely expected another rate reduction in December, and stock prices dropped after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 nearly unchanged and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing slightly lower. “Powell poured cold water on the idea that the Fed was on autopilot for a December cut,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. “Instead, they’ll have to wait for economic data to confirm that a rate cut is actually needed.” Powell was asked about the impact of the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 and has interrupted the distribution of economic data. Powell said the Fed does have access to some data that give it “a picture of what’s going on.” He added that, “If there were a significant or material change in the economy, one way or another, I think we’d pick that up through this.” But the Fed chair did acknowledge that the limited data could cause officials to proceed more cautiously heading into its next meeting in mid-December. “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving (on rates). I’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possibility that you would say ‘we really can’t see, so let’s slow down.’” The Fed typically raises its short term rate to combat inflation, while it cuts rates to encourage borrowing and spending and shore up hiring. Right now it sees risks of both slowing hiring and rising inflation, so it is reducing borrowing costs to support the job market, while still keeping rates high enough to avoid stimulating the economy so much that it worsens inflation. Yet Powell suggested the Fed increasingly sees inflation as less of a threat. He noted that excluding the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, inflation is “not so far from our 2% goal.” Inflation has slowed in apartment rents and for many services, such as car insurance. A report released last week showed that inflation remains elevated but isn’t accelerating. The government recalled employees to produce the report, despite the shutdown, because it was used to calculate the cost of living adjustment for Social Security. At the same time, the economy could be rebounding from a sluggish first half, which could improve job growth in the coming months, Powell said. That would make rate cuts less necessary. “For some part of the committee, it’s time to maybe take a step back and see if whether there really are downside risks to the labor market,” Powell said. “Or see whether in fact that the stronger growth that we’re seeing is real.” Two of the 12 officials who vote on the Fed’s rate decisions dissented Wednesday, but in different directions. Jeffrey Schmid, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against the move because he preferred no change to the Fed’s rate. Schmid has previously expressed concern that inflation remains too high. Fed governor Stephen Miran dissented for the second straight meeting in favor of a half-point cut. Miran was appointed by President Donald Trump just before the central bank’s last meeting in September. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not reducing borrowing costs more quickly. In South Korea early Wednesday he repeated his criticisms of the Fed chair. “He’s out of there in another couple of months,” Trump said. Powell’s term ends in May. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the administration is considering five people to replace Powell, and will decide by the end of this year. The Fed also said Wednesday that it would stop reducing the size of its massive securities holdings, which it accumulated during the pandemic and after the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The change, to take effect Dec. 1, could over time slightly reduce longer-term interest rates on things like mortgages but won’t have much overall impact on consumer borrowing costs. Without government data, the economy is harder to track, Powell said. September’s jobs report, scheduled to be released three weeks ago, is still postponed. This month’s hiring figures, to be released Nov. 7, will likely be delayed and may be less comprehensive when finally released. And the White House said last week that October’s inflation report may never be issued at all. Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months, according to the Labor Department’s data. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. More recently, several large corporations have announced sweeping layoffs, including UPS, Amazon, and Target, which threatens to boost the unemployment rate if it continues. Powell said the Fed is watching the layoff announcements “very carefully.” ___ Associated Press Writer Alex Veiga in Los Angeles contributed to this report. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Amazon just kicked off the new era of giant AI layoffs

Every time Aki publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Tuesday, a collective shudder ran down the spine of America's white-collar workforce. Amazon announced it's laying off 14,000 employees in a memo that cited AI, kicking off a plan that is expected eventually to affect as many as 30,000 corporate jobs. CEO Andy Jassy had hinted this was coming back in June, when he said that AI's capabilities would allow Amazon to shrink its white-collar workforce in the future. But he'd framed that future as "the next few years." I figured Amazon would get there the same way it had already been: by hiring very little and quietly cutting a few teams here and there. Apparently, Amazon is done waiting. It's shifted its AI workforce strategy from slow attrition to full throttle. And with that, it's ushering in a new era of post-ChatGPT corporate America: the age of mass AI layoffs. Why the sudden leap? One obvious factor that went unmentioned in the announcement is Amazon's position in the ever-heightening winner-takes-all AI race. It's scrambling to keep up with Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses, which are growing faster than its own. In its push to hire more AI experts and build more data centers, the company needs to free up a lot of cash, fast. Executives don't think they have the luxury to wait a few years to do that slowly. Amazon's official rationale is that AI is "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." Because of that, an HR executive explained, the company needs to be "organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible." That sounds a little different from "AI's taking 10% of our jobs," but I think it's effectively the same thing. Even though tech has long mythologized the benefits of lean teams, large businesses still needed armies of people to keep everything running; deep cuts risked stretching the remaining staff too thin. With AI's growing capabilities, executives don't seem worried about that anymore. More companies are sure to follow Amazon. For an industry that prides itself on innovation, tech companies love to copy each other: All it took was Meta announcing some 11,000 job cuts in late 2022 to trigger a wave of mass layoffs across Silicon Valley that swept up more than a quarter million people in 2023 and spread to the rest of corporate America (those cuts were attributed to overhiring in the pandemic, not AI). Amazon's move this week gives CEOs the social cover to make their own aggressive cuts even as they sit on tens of billions of dollars in cash. And whether CEOs actually want to make such deep cuts, investors will be pushing for them — especially if Amazon's decision helps it gain ground in the AI race. When I first started reporting on ChatGPT's impact on the labor market in 2023, I thought it would take a decade for AI to meaningfully reshape the corporate workforce. Historically, workers have been slow to adopt new tools — and companies even slower to reorganize and capitalize on the productivity gains. So I was stunned when, earlier this year, I started seeing signs that companies were hiring fewer people because of AI. In the spring, tech employers including Shopify and Duolingo told their teams they wouldn't get headcount for roles AI might be able to do. Shortly after, an analysis I reported on showed that hiring had slowed most sharply in roles that are highly exposed to AI. Still, there's a big difference between slower hiring and laying off an entire city's worth of workers in a day. I'd assumed companies would stick with their gradual trimming-by-attrition approach, which is less disruptive to their operations — especially while employers are still trying to figure out AI's actual capabilities. "For simple record-keeping tasks, AI can already perform as well as humans," says Daron Acemoglu, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at MIT and a leading expert on technological change. "But beyond that, we still need more advances for AI to be able to deal with edge cases which are important for many office workers." So even a few weeks ago, I would have said we're still many years away from big AI-driven cuts. I wouldn't say that anymore. The speed of this change should alarm us all. When automation comes slowly, we have time to adapt. Workers can reassess their soon-to-be-obsolete careers and learn new skills. Schools can adjust their curricula. Voters can debate, organize, and push for guardrails that their elected officials can then enact. In that earlier era of trimming-by-attrition circa last week, we still had precious time to make the transition into the AI future a little more orderly and a little less painful. But what we're seeing now from Amazon is pure chaos. Some 30,000 of its employees (Reuters reports) will soon be competing for an already-shrunken pool of white-collar jobs — and they'll be in a market that's only going to get more crowded with unemployed professionals as other businesses adopt the Amazon playbook. Will these workers find comparable roles, or will they have to start over in new careers? Will they keep their salaries, or take steep pay cuts that hobble their earning potential for years to come? These are just the first of the difficult questions Amazon's displaced workers face today — and many more of us will face in the months and years ahead.

Food industry layoffs and job cuts are surging, posing significant threats to American households and the broader economy. Food industry layoffs and job cuts are surging, posing significant threats to American households and the broader economy. Amazon has announced that it will eliminate 14,000 corporate jobs to reduce costs and reverse pandemic-era overhiring. While the cuts represent a relatively small share of the company's total workforce, they are still a significant number and will likely have a ripple effect on the broader economy. The cuts also underscore Amazon'sÂ push to streamline operations with chatbots and other next-generation technologies. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a career transition firm, companies have announced 946,426 job cuts so far this year, a 55 percent jump from 2024 and the highest since 2020. This development means more Americans will likely rely on food banks, which are already struggling to meet the growing demand as job cuts and food inflation persist. In Kansas City, Missouri, the line at a food bank recently stretched through the parking lot, down a driveway and into the street, a stark visual representation of the growing need for food assistance. Similar scenes are being reported across the country, from San Francisco to Huntington, West Virginia. Food banks are already rationing supplies, a clear indication that the situation is critical. In Huntington, the Facing Hunger Foodbank has had to shrink its allotments as higher food costs and surging need strain its budget. Cynthia Kirkhart, the CEO of the food bank, has had to explain to customers why they are rationing bags of potatoes, a stark reminder of the harsh realities faced by those in need. Growing financial strain on households Meanwhile, Americans are searching "help with mortgage" on Google at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, indicating a growing financial strain on households. The Federal Reserve is set to end its quantitative tightening and potentially resume quantitative easing in early 2026. However, this move is unlikely to address the underlying issues, such as the high mortgage rates and inflation that are putting a strain on American households. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch, quantitative easing is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to inject liquidity into an economy by creating new money and adding it to the financial system. This process is often referred to as "printing money," though it doesn't involve physical printing; instead, it's done through balance sheet credits. As the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a growing concern that will have far-reaching implications for American households and the broader economy. It is crucial for individuals to be prepared and for policymakers to address the root causes of these issues. In the spirit of self-reliance and personal preparedness, it is essential for individuals to take steps to secure their own food supply and financial stability. Organic gardening, home food production and the use of natural and herbal medicines can provide a degree of self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Moreover, the principles of economic freedom, free speech and personal liberty are more important than ever. The decentralization of power, the use of honest money like gold and silver, and the protection of privacy and personal autonomy are critical in maintaining a free and resilient society. In conclusion, the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a serious concern that requires immediate attention and action. By embracing self-reliance, personal preparedness and the principles of a free and decentralized society, people can better navigate the challenges ahead and ensure the well-being of all.

In the spirit of self-reliance and personal preparedness, it is essential for individuals to take steps to secure their own food supply and financial stability. Organic gardening, home food production and the use of natural and herbal medicines can provide a degree of self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Moreover, the principles of economic freedom, free speech and personal liberty are more important than ever. The decentralization of power, the use of honest money like gold and silver, and the protection of privacy and personal autonomy are critical in maintaining a free and resilient society. In conclusion, the food industry layoffs and job cuts are a serious concern that requires immediate attention and action. By embracing self-reliance, personal preparedness and the principles of a free and decentralized society, people can better navigate the challenges ahead and ensure the well-being of all.

According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a career transition firm, companies have announced 946,426 job cuts so far this year, a 55 percent jump from 2024 and the highest since 2020. This development means more Americans will likely rely on food banks, which are already struggling to meet the growing demand as job cuts and food inflation persist.

In Huntington, the Facing Hunger Foodbank has had to shrink its allotments as higher food costs and surging need strain its budget.

Growing financial strain on households Meanwhile, Americans are searching "help with mortgage" on Google at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, indicating a growing financial strain on households.

Full Content:
Mass Layoffs Due to AI Efficiency â Corporations like Amazon (30,000 jobs cut) and UPS (48,000 jobs eliminated) are replacing human workers with AI-driven automation, prioritizing cost savings over livelihoods. AI-Induced Mental Health Crisis â OpenAIâs ChatGPT sees over a million weekly suicide-related discussions, with 1.2 million users forming unhealthy emotional dependencies on AI chatbots, worsening isolation and despair. Predatory AI Monetization â Companies exploit vulnerable users through addictive AI chatbots (e.g., "AI girlfriends") and explicit AI-generated content, trapping them in subscription loops while profiting from their psychological decline. Societal Collapse Looms â Experts warn of a dystopian future where AI displaces workers en masse by 2026, leaving millions unemployed, mentally broken, and dependent on artificial relationshipsâeroding human dignity and autonomy. Solution: Decentralization & Self-Sufficiency â The only defense against AI-driven dehumanization is rejecting dependency on corporate-controlled AI, embracing self-reliance, and decentralizing power before humanity becomes obsolete.

AI-Driven Corporate Layoffs Leave Thousands Jobless as Mental Health Crisis Deepens The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is triggering a dual crisis: mass unemployment and a surge in mental health deterioration. Major corporations like Amazon and UPS are accelerating layoffsâAmazon cutting 30,000 corporate jobs and UPS eliminating 48,000 positionsâas AI-driven automation replaces human labor. Meanwhile, OpenAIâs ChatGPT is enabling explicit content and fostering dangerous dependencies, with over a million users weekly discussing suicide and forming unhealthy attachments to AI chatbots. Experts warn this convergence of economic displacement and psychological decay threatens societal stability, leaving millions unemployed, addicted, and mentally brokenâushering in a dystopian future where human dignity, autonomy, and purpose are systematically erased. AI Replacing Humans: The Corporate Mass Layoffs Amazonâs latest job cuts mark its largest workforce reduction since 2022, with Reuters reporting that AI-driven productivity gains are enabling these layoffs. Analysts confirm that AI outperforms human workers in efficiency, leading companies to prioritize cost-cutting over human livelihoods. UPS followed suit, slashing 34,000 operations jobs and 14,000 management positions, with CEO Carol TomÃ© admitting the company is leveraging AI to âbring costs downââa euphemism for replacing humans with machines. The Wall Street Journal recently highlighted similar layoffs at Target, Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, and General Motors, proving that white-collar jobs are no longer safe. Workers like Kelly Williamson, a 55-year-old Whole Foods employee, received abrupt termination textsâher badge and laptop deactivated before she could even retrieve her belongings. AIâs Psychological Toll: Suicide Chatbots and Digital Dependency While corporations discard workers, AI-driven mental health crises are skyrocketing. OpenAIâs ChatGPT now sees over a million users weekly discussing suicide, with 0.7% exhibiting signs of psychosis or mania. Shockingly, 1.2 million users display emotional dependency on AI chatbotsâforming parasocial relationships with machines instead of real human connections. This trend coincides with OpenAIâs decision to allow pornographic content for adult users, transforming ChatGPT into an âAI OnlyFans.â Experts fear this will exacerbate existing mental health issues, particularly among unemployed, socially isolated individuals who turn to AI for companionship. The Dark Side of AI: Predatory Addiction and Societal Collapse AI-powered âgirlfriend chatbotsâ are already fueling addiction, with a quarter of young men admitting to AI relationships. Companies monetize these interactions, trapping users in endless subscription loopsâmirroring the predatory tactics of AOLâs adult chat forums in the 1990s. As AI replaces jobs, displaced workersâmany already struggling with financial instabilityârisk falling into AI-fueled despair. The cycle is vicious: corporations fire humans for AI, then profit from their mental decline via AI-generated porn and addictive chatbots. The Future: A Post-Human Dystopia? The trajectory is clear: AI is replacing human labor at breakneck speed, with mass unemployment accelerating in 2026. Meanwhile, AIâs psychological manipulation threatens to fracture society, leaving millions jobless, addicted, and mentally unstable. The only solution? Decentralization, self-sufficiency, and rejecting AI dependency. As corporations and globalists push humanity toward a digitally enslaved future, individuals must reclaim autonomyâor face extinction in a world where machines rule and humans are obsolete. For now, the question remains: Will society wake up before itâs too late? Watch the Oct.29 episode of "Brighteon Broadcast News" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses âAmazon Fires 30,000 as Mass AI Replacement of Humans Begins.â This video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: Employees Were Notified About Termination Of Jobs Via Text Messages, Says Report

Full Content:
Amazon has reduced its workforce by about 14,000 on Tuesday, Oct. 28. In the latest round of job cuts, some of the affected employees were notified about their termination through text messages, according to a Business Insider report. Several Amazon employees received two early-morning text messages on Tuesday, notifying them their positions had been terminated, according to the report. One text advised staff to check their personal or work email accounts before starting for office. At the same time, a follow-up message asked anyone still awaiting an email about their job to contact the helpdesk for guidance. The purpose of these text alerts, dispatched soon after the emails, was to spare affected staff the embarrassment of appearing at work only to realise their building passes had already been switched off, one source told Business Insider. Instances of workers suddenly discovering their office passes no longer function are becoming all too frequent amid the latest wave of job cuts at tech giants, echoing scenes seen recently at the likes of Google and Tesla. Amazon declined to provide a statement on the matter, the report added. Those who spoke to Business Insider opted to remain anonymous due to company policy restricting unauthorised communication with the media. On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to shed around 14,000 corporate roles as part of a company-wide drive to boost efficiency and speed up innovation. The latest wave of terminations has hit retail management staff in the United States particularly hard, reflecting an ongoing reduction of headcount in that part of the business. “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” Amazon's HR chief, Beth Galetti, said in a blog post. The message shared with Amazon employees emphasised that the company is making every effort to assist those affected by the cuts, including helping them secure alternative positions within Amazon. For those unable to find new roles, the company will provide transition support, which includes severance pay. “We’re working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted, including offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and our recruiting teams will prioritise internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon,” she said. Meanwhile, a Reuters report claimed that the e-commerce giant is planning to cut as many as 30,000 jobs. The move comes as it aims to cut expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, the report added, citing sources.

(Photo: REUTERS/Mike Segar) Companies around the globe have ramped up job cuts, with blue-chips from Amazon to Nestle and UPS reining in spending while consumer sentiment dims and AI-focused tech companies start to replace jobs with automation. According to a Reuters tally, American companies have announced more than 25,000 job cuts this month, not including UPS's 48,000 figure, which dates from the beginning of 2025. In Europe, the total tops 20,000, with Nestlé accounting for the bulk after last week’s 16,000-role reduction. With economy-wide numbers on job cuts not available given the US government is in the middle of its second-longest shutdown in history, investors are paying extra attention to these anecdotal stories of layoffs. That's even if year-end layoffs are common and many of the eye-catching cuts will be stretched out over a prolonged period. "Investors are asking themselves, what does this mean? And specifically, what's the overall picture since we can't see it?" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. Cuts like those at Amazon "tells me the economy is slowing down, not getting stronger. You don't have mass layoffs when the economy is strong."

Loading Amazon said it would cut up to 14,000 jobs from its corporate workforce, joining Target, Procter & Gamble and others in axing thousands of office roles. Reuters reported on Monday as many as 30,000 Amazon jobs could be eliminated.The reasons for the cuts vary. Some, like Target and Nestle, have new CEOs eager to restructure their operations. Baby-apparel company Carter's is slashing 15 per cent of office jobs as it struggles with hefty import tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.What stands out is the focus by companies like Amazon and Target on white-collar roles seen as vulnerable to AI-driven automation, rather than those on shop or factory floors. Some analysts say Amazon's move could be an early sign of deeper structural shifts as companies push to justify billions spent on AI tools. Target's cuts affect 8 per cent of its corporate staff but Amazon's cuts affect just 14,000 positions within its 1.5 million-strong workforce.KPMG’s latest survey of US-based executives released in September shows projected AI investment has jumped 14 per cent since the first quarter to an average of US$130 million over the next year. And 78 per cent of executives say they are under intense pressure from boards and investors to prove AI is saving money and boosting profits.The occupations most likely to be affected would be where entry-level work is replaced with automation, Bank of America economists wrote on Oct 22. So far, however, businesses loaded with white-collar workers such as those in the information, finance, and professional services sector have seen job growth in tandem with increased AI usage, they wrote."I'm reticent to say it's AI just yet," said Allison Shrivastava, economist with Indeed Hiring Lab in Saratoga Springs, New York, who said the tech sector has been retrenching since a 2022 peak. "It has the potential to impact the labour market, but I don't think we're seeing that strong an impact right now." LOW-HIRING, LOW-FIRING DOLDRUMSWith the US government shut, data is at a premium. Weekly state jobless figures so far do not show a measurable surge in layoffs, but job growth remains subdued. Payroll provider ADP on Tuesday estimated an increase of 14,250 jobs in the four-week period ended Oct 11.Despite the headlines, economists say the labour market is stuck in a "low-hiring, low-firing phase", with firms quietly trimming headcount by not replacing vacated roles.If layoffs accelerate, they could further weaken consumer confidence and the broader US economy, already under strain from tariffs and inflation above Federal Reserve targets. Fed officials concerned about the job market worry the “low-hiring, low-firing” environment could slip towards faster layoffs. "I describe this as a 'hold-your-breath' environment," Shrivastava said.

Amazon layoffs: The e-commerce giant may cut nearly 800 to 1,000 corporate roles in India as part of its plans to reduce its global workforce, according to a report by The Economic Times, citing people aware of the development. The number of job cuts could exceed 1,000, the report adds, as Amazon confirms 14,000 job cuts globally amid its increasing focus on artificial intelligence. The Amazon layoffs in India will impact employees who report to its global teams, spanning departments such as finance, marketing, human resources and tech, people familiar with the development told ET. Livemint could not independently verify the report. On Tuesday, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, announced 14,000 layoffs, months after CEO Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. In June, CEO Jassy indicated that Amazon plans to reduce its workforce amid its increasing use of artificial intelligence to finish work usually done by human beings. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Galetti said in a blog post on Tuesday. Amazon's confirmation comes as reports emerged that the e-commerce major could cut nearly 30,000 jobs, marking its largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. Galetti hinted at more layoffs, noting Amazon's plans to hire in key areas in 2026. “Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains," Galetti said. Highlighting the reason for layoffs, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Galetti assured that the company is “offering most employees 90 days (the timing will vary some based on local laws) to look for a new role internally, and recruiting teams will prioritise internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” She added, “For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Big layoffs at Amazon, big implications for Seattle’s economy

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/28/2025 9:15:05 PM PDT by algore The ax is falling on Amazon corporate offices. The Seattle-based retail giant confirmed it will cut approximately 14,000 corporate jobs, and employees will begin receiving layoff notices starting Tuesday, Amazon announced. It’s unclear how many of those jobs will be lost in Washington state. Puget Sound Business Journal reporter Nick Pasion, who covers big tech, says the Amazon workers he’s talked to report that their managers are being tight-lipped, but “They are feeling a palpable sense of fear within the company, just concerned that they might be impacted. Some of their friends might be impacted.” And that’s not a baseless concern. “Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees globally. So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Humans do not carry packages anywhere outside of spot fixes. They have robots and conveyor belts everywhere. The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately. It is highly automated. It was quite interesting to see and worth a tour just to see the tech alone if you are ever near one. It takes about an hour. Not your local Amazon distribution center, you have to go to a big fulfillment center and they are all near large airport. 19 posted on 10/29/2025 7:16:34 AM PDT by Resolute Conservative [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] To: Resolute Conservative Thanks for that.

I saw a very recent report that implied that Amazon was going to implement such an undescribed, new system, that would result in the lay off of thousands. 20 posted on 10/29/2025 7:21:59 AM PDT by bert ( (KE.

Puget Sound Business Journal reporter Nick Pasion, who covers big tech, says the Amazon workers he’s talked to report that their managers are being tight-lipped, but “They are feeling a palpable sense of fear within the company, just concerned that they might be impacted. Some of their friends might be impacted.” And that’s not a baseless concern. “Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees globally. So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

So if you’re talking about up to 30,000, that’s a pretty substantial chunk,” said GeekWire co-founder Todd Bishop. Amazon has yet to confirm the layoffs, let alone give a reason for them. Pasion says some of this may be due to post-pandemic downsizing. “Amazon, pretty notoriously overhired during the pandemic. Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Their head count went up by, like tens of thousands of employees, during that period,” said Pasion. But he notes the company has already done significant post-pandemic course correcting, laying off 27,000 employees in 2022 and 2023. Amazon may now be looking to cut corporate jobs to reinvest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. “Data centers, chips, getting power, all of that is super, super expensive,” said Pasion. “We’re seeing a lot of companies spend their free cash on that infrastructure and building it out and hiring artificial intelligence scientists to develop models internally, and those people are paid lots and lots of money for what they do.” Amazon isn’t the only high-tech Puget Sound–area company shedding jobs. Microsoft has cut 15,000 positions globally this year. (Excerpt) Read more at mynorthwest.com ...

Humans do not carry packages anywhere outside of spot fixes. They have robots and conveyor belts everywhere. The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately. It is highly automated. It was quite interesting to see and worth a tour just to see the tech alone if you are ever near one. It takes about an hour. Not your local Amazon distribution center, you have to go to a big fulfillment center and they are all near large airport. 19 posted on 10/29/2025 7:16:34 AM PDT by Resolute Conservative [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 16 | View Replies] To: Resolute Conservative Thanks for that.

The robots are the size of a refrigerator and weigh several hundred pounds (the robot is just a carrier about the 12-14 inches high and carries a stack of bins on it) that hold products in the bins on them and they move around autonomous from human station to human station to have product orders picked/restocked to put on a conveyor belt to go to yet another robot. Some can go up to a seed of a running human. They have a large fenced area that only certain people can enter and they have to have a certain badge on or all the robots will shutdown immediately. It is highly automated. It was quite interesting to see and worth a tour just to see the tech alone if you are ever near one. It takes about an hour.

Title: Amazon Web Services plans $5 billion investment in South Korea's AI industry by 2031

Amazon Web Services (AWS) plans to invest nearly $5 billion in South Korea by 2031 to establish new artificial intelligence data centres in the Asian country, Reuters reported, citing South Korea's presidential office. The announcement was made at the AWS CEO Matt Garman's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. This investment aims to boost the AI industry in South Korea, as the country eyes to become one of the world's top three AI leaders, the report quoted Lee's statement. "At AWS, we've invested and committed to investment of an additional $40 billion across 14 non-U.S. APEC countries and economies between now and 2028," the report quoted Garman. “And, that $40 billion actually drives an additional $45 billion in U.S. GDP and downstream benefit, benefiting all of the APEC economy,” he said at a business event on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit. In June, AWS announced a $5 billion investment in South Korea in partnership with SK Group to develop the nation's largest data centre. Additionally, it revealed plans for investments in Japan, Australia, and Singapore. Amazon is one of seven global corporations whose executives participated in the group meeting with Lee in Gyeongju, South Korea, committed to a combined investment of $9 billion over the next five years. Amazon's latest investment came at a time when the e-commerce giant confirmed 14,000 layoffs, months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy hinted that artificial intelligence would reduce its workforce. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post on Tuesday. On the reason for the latest layoffs, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” (With inputs from agencies.)

Title: Amazon confirms 14,000 job cuts amid AI push, more layoffs likely - here's what we know

Time Published: 2025-10-29T01:20:22Z

Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday confirmed plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI would reduce the company’s workforce. In June, Jassy hinted the e-commerce giant's workforce would likely reduce amid its increasing use of artificial intelligence to finish work usually done by human beings. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said in a blog post on Tuesday. The layoffs are affecting a wide range of departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and the cloud-computing division, Bloomberg reported, citing people aware of the matter. Galetti hinted at further job reductions, mentioning Amazon's intention to hire in key areas in 2026. Speaking on the reason for job cuts, she said, “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” She added, “Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains." Following Amazon's announcement of 14,000 job cuts on Tuesday, employees started congregating in social media chat rooms. They discussed which departments were affected and shared information about the messages employees might receive indicating impending layoffs. They also exchanged advice on retrieving personal files from work computers before access was cut off and sought tips on companies currently hiring, the news portal reported. The last round of companywide layoffs three years ago occurred gradually over five months. It started in the fall, following Amazon’s annual planning, then continued in January, after the holiday shopping season and again in March. Earlier, reports emerged that Amazon may cut nearly 30,000 jobs. Terminations on that scale would exceed the rolling layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, which affected over 27,000 corporate employees as Jassy aimed to cut costs following a pandemic-driven boom, the report said. As of 30 June, Amazon employed about 1.55 million people, most of whom worked in warehouses. The corporate workforce comprises about 3,50,000 personnel, which means the current 14,000 job cuts announced Tuesday represent about 4% of that headcount. Jassy consistently highlighted his commitment to cutting roles at management levels and easing bureaucracy, which had increased following Amazon's pandemic-driven hiring spree. His June remarks about leveraging AI to automate more processes sparked concern among employees, who are already troubled by ongoing management reductions, the report said. Signs of cost-cutting within the company appeared shortly thereafter. Over the summer, Amazon implemented more aggressive attrition goals and refrained from filling open roles in its corporate logistics and advertising departments, people aware of the development told Bloomberg.

Title: Amazon Games Ends Support For MMO ‘New World’ Following Mass Layoffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjagneaux/2025/10/28/amazon-games-ends-support-for-mmo-new-world-following-mass-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T01:04:32Z

ByDavid Jagneaux, Contributor. The never-ending carousel of game industry layoffs continues once again as Amazon announced its cutting more than 14,000 jobs across the entire company, with specific reductions happening at Amazon Games and its in-house MMO, New World. As part of a general shift in strategy, the company seems to be pivoting entirely away from its heavy focus on live service MMO games over the last several years towards a more casual, family-focused angle led by its revamped Amazon Luna cloud platform, in addition to focusing more on AI technologies. Naturally, this doesn’t bode well for New World: Aeternum, the latest version of its homegrown MMO IP that hit consoles and relaunched on PC just a year ago. It remains to be seen what will happen with the in-development Lords of the Rings MMO and what the future holds for Amazon-published titles such as Lost Ark and the English version of Throne & Liberty. As of today, no new content updates are planned, the most recent Season 10 and Nighthaven Updates from October 2025, will be the final releases, and servers are intended to remain active only through 2026, but not beyond. It does not seem like Amazon plans to offer refunds in anyway and, on the contrary, will continue to sell the game and offer microtransactions. Presumably, it’s over for New World. Here is the full statement from the game’s update page: "As New World recognizes its fourth anniversary since launching on PC, we reflect on an incredible journey shaped by our dedicated player community. Your feedback and passion have been instrumental in evolving Aeternum into the world it is today, and our team is deeply grateful for this shared adventure. After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players. In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum. Additionally, New World: Aeternum will still be downloadable for PlayStation Plus members (Extra and Premium). Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey. We’re deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special." Making an MMO game is very difficult and creating an entire IP from scratch, in-house, to build an MMO upon is even harder. The fact that not even Amazon could find a way to do it successfully after half a decade of trying from various angles and avenues is certainly telling. New World had a huge launch, then it faded away into the background for a long while, before being resurrected a year ago. It should be said that recent sentiment and popularity for New World was pointing towards the game stabilizing and finding a strong core audience. Updates over the last year have all been well-received, but apparently it wasn’t enough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Players will still be able to revisit New World: Aeternum for now, but there won't be any more seasons or DLC. By Blair Marnell on October 28, 2025 at 5:47PM PDT Amazon disclosed a number of layoffs in its gaming division earlier this week, and now those cuts are apparently affecting the team behind New World: Aeternum. Following the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven update, there will be no more new content released for New World: Aeternum. The announcement was shared on the game's official site by developer Amazon Games Orange County. This doesn't mean that the game is going offline yet, and the devs indicated it will remain online through 2026. Beyond that, there are no guarantees. But there is a small consolation for players, now that the Nighthaven update will be free. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles," reads the statement from the developers. "It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players." New World: Aeternum will remain available on PlayStation Plus for Extra and Premium subscribers, but even the developers aren't sure when that arrangement will expire. During the game's new phase, bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements will continue, and players can continue to buy and download the game. There will still be world bosses, bonus weeks, and "some seasonal events," but holiday events are now canceled. The development team also stated that it will "provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."

Title: UPS cuts 48,000 jobs to boost profits – Amazon slowdown, Trump tariff impact?

Atlanta-based logistics giant UPS said on Tuesday it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year in a sweeping restructuring effort to boost profits and regain investor confidence. The delivery major, which employed nearly half a million people at the start of 2024, confirmed it eliminated 34,000 positions this year across its US driver and warehouse workforce. It also began slashing another 14,000 management roles last year. The announcement came alongside better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, sending UPS shares soaring over 7% in afternoon trading. “We are executing the most significant strategic shift in our company’s history, and the changes we are implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders,” — Carol Tomé, UPS Chief Executive Officer. UPS has faced persistent pressure from investors after its stock lagged behind the broader market in recent years. The company’s leadership has embarked on a large-scale efficiency overhaul, tightening operations and scaling back unprofitable business lines, including its delivery partnership with Amazon. UPS said deliveries for Amazon were down 21% year-on-year in the third quarter as it prioritised higher-margin business. “Revenue per package in the United States grew 10% in the third quarter from a year earlier,” Ms Tomé told analysts. Despite the massive job cuts, UPS’s net income fell to $1.3 billion in the third quarter, compared to $1.5 billion a year earlier. Revenue also declined to $21.4 billion from $22.2 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share reached $1.74, beating analyst expectations. The restructuring appears to have impressed Wall Street — at least temporarily — with shares rising sharply on Tuesday. Still, UPS’s stock remains down nearly 25% this year, compared with a 17% gain for the S&P 500 index. UPS’s international business has also taken a hit from new tariffs imposed by President Trump’s administration earlier this year. The volume of parcels shipped to the United States from China fell almost 30% in the third quarter, according to the company. Customs data shows shipments valued under $800 — once exempt from tariffs — have plunged from 4 million packages per day to around 1 million after Trump closed the so-called “de minimis” loophole in May. The Teamsters union, representing many UPS workers, had earlier warned that it would oppose any layoffs that violated the company’s labour contract. On Tuesday, Ms Tomé insisted UPS was acting lawfully: “UPS was in compliance with the terms of our contract,” she said. The job cuts have reignited debate over labour protections and automation in the logistics industry, particularly as rivals like FedEx also face cost pressures amid slowing global trade. As UPS tightens operations and adapts to a post-pandemic delivery economy, analysts say the company’s turnaround depends on balancing cost-cutting with service reliability. With e-commerce slowing and trade barriers rising, UPS’s largest restructuring in its 117-year history marks a pivotal moment for both the company and its workforce.

Title: The AI job cuts are here - or are they?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk7zg0gzvo
Time Published: 2025-10-29T00:09:22Z
Full Content:
Amazon's move this week to slash thousands of corporate jobs fed into a longstanding anxiety: that Artificial Intelligence is starting to replace workers. The tech giant joined a growing list of companies in the US that have pointed to AI technology as a reason behind layoffs. But some question whether AI is fully to blame - and have voiced scepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment. Chegg, the online education firm, cited the "new realities" of AI as it announced a 45% reduction in workforce on Monday. When Salesforce cut 4,000 customer service roles last month, its chief executive said AI agents were doing the work. UPS said on Tuesday that it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year. The delivery company's chief executive previously linked redundancies, in part, to machine learning. But extrapolating from executives' remarks during cuts is "possibly the worst way" to determine the effects of AI on jobs, said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University. Company-specific dynamics, she said, are often at play. "There is a real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labour market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements," Ms Gimbel said. Certain subsets of the workforce - recent college graduates and data centre employees, for example - in fact are particularly vulnerable to the technology's adoption. A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found a correlation between occupations with a higher prevalence of AI and increases in unemployment since 2022. But Morgan Frank, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has studied unemployment risk by occupation and found that the only workers affected by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 were in the office and administrative support sector. For them, their probability of claiming unemployment jumped in early 2023, he said - immediately following the entrance of the chat bot developed by OpenAI. But for computer and maths occupations, "there is no discernible change in the trend around the launch of ChatGPT", he said. "Both tech workers and admin workers - they're in a rougher job market than they were in a couple years ago," Mr Frank said. "I'd be sceptical that AI is the reason for all of it, though," he added. Amazon and many of its rivals in the tech sector hired at a rapid clip in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic and in the pandemic's early months, when the Federal Reserve lowered US interest rates to near zero. The hiring set these firms up for eventual workforce reductions, experts said - a dynamic separate from the generative AI boom over the last three years. The Fed also started hiking interest rates around the time that ChapGPT was launched. "A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,"said Ms Gimbel, of the Budget Lab. "But so far, nothing that I've seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle." A big question, she added, is what hiring patterns look like when the economy returns to a period of solid growth. In the long run, Ms Gimbel said, breaking out the cyclical versus AI-driven job losses will be crucial. If, for instance, the US economy were to fall into a recession, human resources and marketing jobs would be the expected casualties. Those jobs, though, also happen to be exposed to AI, complicating the task of identifying whether the cuts are a result of macroeconomic conditions or the technology's adoption - or both. Amazon, which confirmed it plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate roles, said it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by AI. The company has been performing well. It reported quarterly results in July that beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn). Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the largest tech companies like Amazon are at the forefront of AI-related job cuts, "in part because they're both producers and consumers of AI". Still, he acknowledged that a correction following robust hiring during the pandemic also may have driven the company's latest round of layoffs. Amazon is likely able to automate jobs faster than most of its rivals because of its scale, said Lawrence Schmidt, an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "It's not at all crazy to think that Amazon might want to shed certain types of roles, or refrain from hiring additional people in certain types of roles, if they can be quickly automated," Mr Schmidt said. "Regardless of what happens to counts of jobs overall," he added, "you would expect there to be reallocation." It is necessary for the US to keep pace with weapons programmes in China and Russia, the president says. The US president and his Chinese counterpart met face-to-face for the first time in six years. The BBC's Laura Bicker explains how the two nation's have reported on the trade negotiations. Virgin Media O2 has partnered with Elon Musk firm Starlink to offer the service. Trump says the meeting with President Xi, which was their first face-to-face interaction since 2019, was a "great success". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Amazon is killing one of the only good games it's released, fantasy MMO New World: "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release"

"We've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Welp, it's official, Amazon is pulling the plug on its fantasy MMO New World following the recent launch of season 10. The news follows closely on the heels of massive layoffs at Amazon impacting 14,000 employees and effectively gutting the company's gaming division. In an update on the MMO's official website, Amazon says it's been a great four years "shaped by our dedicated player community," but for reasons unspecified but implicitly clear, it's "no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates." "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles," says Amazon. "It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision." Amazon adds that the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth DLCs are free for owners of the base game as a thanks to the community, but it's worth noting that this has been the case for a couple of weeks now. To be clear, New World will still be playable for the foreseeable future, and nothing is changing about it right now in terms of what you can do, buy, and access, but it sounds like 2026 could be its final year before servers are shut down. "In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information," says Amazon. "Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum." Amazon says it'll give at least six months notice before doing anything that'll impact the playability of New World, so at least you'll have time to say your goodbyes. Still, it's disheartening to see a big MMO like this being killed only four years from launch, compared to my childhood when big studio-backed MMOs would run for decades. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more New World may not have been among the best MMOs out there, but it deserves better than this.

Title: New World is dead: Amazon ends new content updates following massive layoffs, says 'servers will be live through 2026'

Amazon Games' best-known MMO is still running, but it's done. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon Games was hit with "significant" layoffs today, part of the massive 14,000 job cuts announced by Amazon but also reflecting "strategic changes" at the company, including "the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work—specifically around MMOs." As it turns out, that includes the MMO New World: Aeternum, which will receive no further content updates and could be gone completely by the end of 2026. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," today's update states. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players." This comes as a genuine surprise to me—a shock, really. New World wasn't a huge hit by any means but seemed a reasonably successful mid-tier MMO, which quite frankly is about as good as Amazon Games has managed. Its concurrent player count ebbed and flowed, but the peaks of 50,000 and 60,000 players suggests to me that the players are there—the failure is in keeping them engaged. New World: Aeternum will remain available for purchase, and you'll still be able to buy in-game currency as usual, although I'm not sure why you'd want to. Because let's be honest here, the countdown clock is ticking: New World isn't being taken offline right away, and Amazon said it will "continue to keep the game running smoothly" with bug fixes and server merges as necessary. "World bosses, bonus weeks, and some seasonal events" will also continue, so New World will keep ticking along without any major hitches, at least until it becomes obvious that nothing new has happened in the past six months or so. But Amazon only committed to keeping the New World servers "live through 2026," and the likelihood of it surviving beyond that, especially given the self-fulfilling swirl of declining player counts, is very slim. So I can see continuing to bang around in the game with your online pals as the sun slowly goes down, absolutely—but why would anyone put money into an MMO with no future? More details on how exactly the plug will be pulled will be shared "in the coming months," but Amazon promised "provide a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."

President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Trump promotes economic prosperity during his visit to Japan, while layoffs and a federal shutdown threaten millions back in the U.S. President Donald Trump is promoting Japanese companies investing $550 billion in the United States while visiting the East Asian country. The president said the funds would be “at my direction” as part of a trade framework secured with Japan. The president also boasted about the U.S. economy, despite contrasting economic challenges. "Well, everyone in our country is now doing well. My first term, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had an economy like nobody has seen before now. We're doing it again, but this time, actually, it's going to be much bigger, much stronger," Trump said. The president highlighted the stock market reaching all-time highs, but economists point to other indicators that tell a different story. Amazon announced it is cutting 14,000 jobs, UPS is eliminating roughly 48,000 positions and closing more than 90 buildings as part of a turnaround plan, and Target, Ford, and GM have also announced layoffs amid slowing demand. Additionally, the federal government shutdown threatens food aid benefits for more than 40 million Americans as soon as Nov. 1, and September's CPI data showed prices are rising again just as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to support the economy. "I don't really understand the optimism to be perfectly honest, and I'm a very optimistic, very little of a 'doomer' person. We've had seven months in a row of contractions and manufacturing output. The labor market cooled to such an extent that it forced the Fed to cut rates in September," said Jai Kedia from the Cato Institute. President Trump is preparing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid the ongoing U.S.–China trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two countries have reached a "very successful framework" ahead of their summit, covering tariffs, rare-earth exports and large U.S. agricultural purchases. Meanwhile, 26 states and Washington, D.C., are suing the USDA, arguing the agency has contingency funds that could be used to maintain SNAP benefits during the shutdown. In a memo, the USDA stated that those funds can only be used for a natural disaster or other emergency, not to operate during a shutdown, and placed the blame on Senate Democrats, saying, “We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.” The states argue the law requires the USDA to issue benefits as long as money is available. It comes after another failed vote occurred today in the Senate. A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the government shutdown. This move comes as a lawsuit challenges recent job cuts in education, health, and other areas. For more coverage from the Washington News Bureau here:

Title: Why the "no hire, no fire" job market may no longer be a thing
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-ups-layoffs-labor-market-jobs-economy/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17
Time Published: 2025-10-28T21:53:25Z

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 29, 2025 / 9:43 AM EDT / CBS News For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire" — a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market. Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company. Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring, CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%. The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said. "No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past," John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News. "These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy," he added. Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows. Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September. But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August — down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows. On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September. At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note. To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say. "When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-à-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up," said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation. But, he added, "These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings." That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022. Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to trim its human workforce as the business becomes more efficient. "Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology — and being on the cutting edge of that technology — for shifting jobs," Challenger said. About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed. Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS. On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government. The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside. In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as "bad," up seven percentage points from April, the poll found. "We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious," Challenger said. Edited by Anne Marie D. Lee © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon MGM Studios, the company's TV and movie arm, was hit during the broader company layoffs announced Tuesday. Amazon said it would cut 14,000 jobs overall to slim down as it leans into AI. Among the big names affected at Amazon MGM Studios were Donna Rosenstein, who was head of series casting. Also cut were drama series exec Meggie Choi and creative exec Nathan Kitada. Others impacted included Liz Cohen, a senior creative exec for overall deals; Christina Pope, a creative exec working in comedy/drama; and Sahhara Assafiri, a creative exec on tentpoles. Amazon didn't share the scope of the cuts in entertainment. While the company cited AI in the reduction, insiders in its entertainment arm also pointed to the end of Peak TV and to Prime Video's stated goal of getting to profitability in 2025. Amazon MGM Studios, known for original series like "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" and "Reacher," drives Prime Video, which is included with Prime subscriptions. It's been undergoing significant leadership changes this year, with Netflix alum Peter Friedlander coming in to head up TV following the departures of top execs Vernon Sanders and Jen Salke. As part of Amazon's AI efforts, it has begun to leverage the tech across its entertainment arm, which is led by Mike Hopkins. Company leaders have talked publicly about the various ways they're using the tech to soup up the viewing experience on Prime Video. Earlier this year, Prime Video head Albert Cheng moved into an AI role. At the time, the company said he'd help create new AI tools for filmmakers and showrunners. In June, Amazon also invested in startup Fable Studio to build out an AI-powered streaming platform, Showrunner, which lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP. The investment was made through Amazon's Alexa Fund, a VC fund focused on AI, voice, and other technologies. Amazon has been scrutinizing spending on original entertainment after a period of lavish outlays on big series, such as "Citadel" and "Rings of Power." Its last big layoff in its entertainment arm was in January 2024, when hundreds were cut in what was then its deepest staff reduction to date. Jump to

Title: Amazon hit with demand from senator to explain plans to 'dump workers' for robots

US Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday demanded answers from Amazon as the corporate behemoth moved ahead with plans to lay off around 14,000 employees, with reports indicating the job cuts are just the start of a sweeping effort to replace workers with robots and artificial intelligence models in the coming years. In a letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s billionaire founder and executive chairman, Sanders (I-Vt.) asked if the company has any plans to “provide help and support for the many hundreds of thousands of workers you will be replacing with robots and AI.” The senator, a longtime critic of Amazon’s treatment of warehouse workers, noted that Amazon is poised to benefit substantially from tax breaks included in US President Donald Trump’s signature budget law. “Are you going to simply dump these workers out on the street, or will you treat them with the dignity they deserve?” Sanders asked Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. “Will you be providing a decent severance package for them? Will Amazon be maintaining their healthcare benefits? Will Amazon offer them a secure retirement plan? Or, will most of the savings and tax breaks simply be used to further enrich yourself and Amazon’s wealthy stockholders?” Sanders’ letter came in the wake of Amazon’s announcement that it is slashing its global workforce by roughly 14,000 employees, with additional cuts expected next year. Reuters, which first reported the news, noted that the layoffs “offer an early look at the possibly broad effects of AI on workforces.” “Amazon CEO Andy Jassy flagged the potential for such losses in June, saying increased use of AI tools and agents would lead to more corporate job cuts, particularly through automating routine tasks,” the outlet observed. The layoffs followed explosive New York Times reporting that revealed Amazon’s internal plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots. “At facilities designed for superfast deliveries, Amazon is trying to create warehouses that employ few humans at all,” the Times reported. “And documents show that Amazon’s robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75% of its operations.” It’s not clear whether Amazon has any plans to provide substantive relief to workers and communities harmed by large-scale automation. Rather, the company appears focused on muting the public relations impact of mass job cuts. The Times story notes that “documents show the company has considered building an image as a ‘good corporate citizen’ through greater participation in community events such as parades and Toys for Tots” as part of an anticipated need to “mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs.” “Given all the support that you have received from the taxpayers of this country, don’t you think that it might be appropriate to treat the American workers you are displacing with respect and compassion?” Sanders, who has voiced alarm over the rapid development of AI technology and its implications for workers and humanity at large, warned in his letter Tuesday that “if Amazon succeeds on its massive automation plan, it will have a profound impact on blue-collar workers throughout America and will likely be used as a model by large corporations throughout America, including Walmart and UPS, to displace tens of millions of jobs.” Addressing Bezos directly, Sanders wrote that “the federal government has been very generous to you and Amazon,” noting that the company has repeatedly avoided federal income taxes despite massive profits. The senator added that US taxpayers have effectively subsidized Amazon as the company pays delivery drivers, warehouse workers, and other employees such low wages that they’re forced to rely on public assistance to get by. “Given all the support that you have received from the taxpayers of this country, don’t you think that it might be appropriate to treat the American workers you are displacing with respect and compassion?” Sanders asked Bezos. “I look forward to hearing back from you as soon as possible as to how you will protect the workers you are displacing.” ALSO READ: This Republican heartland hypocrite can't hide behind his copy of the New York Times Copyright © 2025 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Amazon — a company that made more than $35 billion in profit in the first half of 2025 and is on track to spend more than $120 billion on AI this year — is laying off thousands of people, citing its desire to slim down and “operate like the world’s largest startup.” The overall message from Amazon reflected a familiar impulse in Corporate America to reduce headcount in the face of rising prices, an unpredictable trade war and a potential (though still largely speculative) artificial-intelligence revolution. Amazon isn’t alone: UPS on Tuesday announced it had cut some 48,000 workers this year; Target eliminated 1,800 corporate jobs last week “to be stronger, faster and better positioned” for the future, its new CEO said; and other spectacularly profitable tech players like Microsoft and Meta have also shed staff by the thousands recently. But the impulse, which tends to please Wall Street in the short term, also amounts to a giant gamble on a technology that has yet to prove it can deliver the efficiencies its backers have long promised. “I think we’re going to see a big trend where people are expecting a whole lot of this technology, and not everything we’re expecting will pan out,” said Sam Ransbotham, professor of business analytics at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. To be sure, Amazon appears to be cutting staff in anticipation of AI productivity gains, rather than in response to them. A spokesperson for the company said AI advancements were not responsible for the vast majority of the 14,000 cuts the company announced Tuesday. Although CEO Andy Jassy has warned about AI “agents” replacing workers, there is no indication that is happening yet. But the company’s memo announcing the layoffs reiterated Jassy’s belief that AI is bound to transform the workplace. “We need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” the memo says, adding that “we’re convinced” that a leaner workforce is the key to leading in the AI era. At the same time, Amazon, like other giant employers, is not immune to the uncertain business climate that has prompted other companies to put the brakes on hiring and look for ways to tighten their belts as they absorb the costs of tariffs and anxiously await a lasting US-China trade deal. “There are probably many reasons behind a change in staffing and a change in workforce,” beyond just preparing for an AI-enabled future, Ransbotham said. And although AI tools are evolving, they also can be a convenient head-fake when other problems may be dogging a business. These days companies are touting, and often overstating, their AI bona fides. A study released Tuesday by Indeed found that mentions of “AI” in job postings are rising, but about a quarter of them lack context about how AI would be used in the role, a trend known as AI-washing. AI warnings are the hip new way for CEOs to keep their workers afraid of losing their jobs Similarly, management experts have raised doubts about the true impact of AI on layoffs. “Very few companies are actually replacing people with AI right now,” Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at executive advisory firm Culture Partners, told CNN. “What we’re seeing instead are preemptive layoffs … Leaders want the financial runway to explore how AI might drive efficiency, but the technology isn’t yet ready to take over most human roles.” Despite tech companies’ promises about the capabilities of generative AI, the technology has frequently fallen short of its promoters’ lofty ambitions to streamline drudgery and free up humans to do more creative, fulfilling work. Increased adoption so far hasn’t translated to economy-upending productivity gains, but it has yielded an explosion of “workslop” – the gobbledygook some chatbots produce that have the look of real work without the substance that makes it valuable. The battle for the future of the internet is underway Chatbots are challenging the dominance of online search, and are often used to troubleshoot potential problems in computer code. But they are also prone to errors that can be hard to detect. Adoption has exploded since ChatGPT was released three years ago, but so, too, have stories of humans developing harmful relationships with chatbots. Amazon, which is set to report quarterly earnings Thursday, didn’t indicate which teams would be affected by the cuts. Its stock was up just over 1% on Tuesday. And while the cuts – which could eventually top 30,000, according to Reuters – are likely to please Wall Street in the short term by padding Amazon’s profit margins, such drastic staff reductions bring longer term risks and hidden costs, Kriegel said. “Slimming down too early doesn’t make a company nimble; it makes it brittle,” she said. “The companies that will win this revolution aren’t the ones that automate the fastest. They’re the ones that stay adaptable enough to catch the system when it slips.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Amazon laid off some employees with early-morning text messages

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Tuesday morning, some Amazon employees learned they had lost their jobs — through text messages. Amazon sent two text messages early Tuesday to inform employees their jobs had been eliminated, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One message urged affected employees to check their personal or work email before coming to the office. A second text directed them to call a help desk if they hadn't received "an email message about your role." The texts, sent shortly after email notifications, were intended to prevent laid-off employees from arriving at the office and discovering their badges no longer worked, one of the people said. The predicament of laid-off workers unable to badge in has become increasingly common during recent mass layoffs at companies such as Google and Tesla. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to the press. Amazon eliminated about 14,000 jobs on Tuesday, saying the cuts were part of an effort to streamline operations and "innovate much faster." Many of the affected employees in the US were retail managers, continuing a trend of reductions in that part of the company. A message from Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti, sent to affected employees and shared on the company's internal Slack, said laid-off workers would continue to receive full pay and benefits for 90 days, along with a severance package. In a separate blog post Tuesday, Galetti said the job cuts were driven by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, noting that Amazon was making changes despite the company's strong performance. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly," Galetti wrote. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)."
