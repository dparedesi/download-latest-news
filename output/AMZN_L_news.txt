Title: Amazon Is Automating 600,000 Jobs. Here Are The 5 Jobs At Risk In 2026

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. When Amazon’s internal strategy documents suggest that robots, AI, and overall automation will replace an estimated 600,000 jobs that would otherwise hire humans (more than half a million) by 2033, take note. The second largest employer in the U.S. has spoken, and it’s a strong indication of where we’re heading in the future of work. That scale of disruption will leave few job categories at the big tech giant untouched, and many workers will need a plan B. This, if anything, is a stark reminder of how AI is disrupting the workforce at scale, and the need for upskilling and reskilling in other areas. For context, this is happening even as the tech giant plans to double its output through the next few years. Karen Weise, writing for The New York Times (who first reported this story), notes that “Amazon’s plans could have profound impact on blue-collar jobs throughout the country and serve as a model for other companies like Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, and UPS. The company transformed the U.S. work force as it created a booming demand for warehousing and delivery jobs. But now, as it leads the way for automation, those roles could become more technical, higher paid and more scarce.” Whenever there is a wave of layoffs or the threat of roles being cut out from an organizational structure, the usual likely culprits tend to be roles that are repetitive or routine in nature. These roles also do not typically require strategy and strong decision-making and creative skills, which makes it easier for them to be at risk and liable to automation. Here are some examples of roles that would likely be targeted by Amazon as they ramp up AI implementation across their global operations: Throughout the supply chain, there are plenty of opportunities for automation because much of it consists of predictable workflows. As a result, Amazon will naturally anticipate high cost-savings from robots. And even though the entire Amazon workforce won’t disappear, the existing responsibilities of remaining jobs can be expected to change significantly. If you work in a blue-collar role liable to automation, or you’re concerned that your knowledge-based job is at risk of AI, here are some things you can do to future-proof your career and finances: Today is day one of your transition. Start now to upskill and prove your value in ways that robots and AI can never replicate.

Title: MindsEye employees renew allegations that GTA ex-producer Leslie Benzies’ Build a Rocket Boy was chaotic, mismanaged

The MindsEye fallout saga continues as new allegations have surfaced from former employees, detailing years of chaos behind the game's development, which was released in June to poor reviews and criticism that ranged from disappointed users to those that called it 'one of the worst games' they had ever played. Once eagerly watched in part due to Benzies’ role in elevating the Grand Theft Auto series into a cultural icon, Build A Rocket Boy secured over $300 million by 2024 and expanded to 448 employees across offices in Edinburgh, Budapest, and Montpellier. While it was initially focused on the ambitious multiplayer RPG Everywhere, which promised user-generated content in a futuristic open world, the studio shifted gears to MindsEye, which was originally perceived as a tie-in experience within Everywhere. Former employees have painted a grim picture of internal dysfunction, with one staff member, Jamie, who left BARB in 2022, telling the BBC that “Leslie never decided what game he wanted to make,” leading to “no coherent direction” that “plagued the project from the start.” Former lead data analyst, Ben Newbon, spoke about constant “knee-jerk” decisions from upper management, where critical feedback was consistently “ignored and never actioned.” At the same time, Benzies’ micromanagement manifested into what the team started to call “Leslie tickets” or “Leslie bugs.” All direct instructions from Leslie Benzies took precedence over the development team's ongoing work, disrupting teams' ability to manage their own workflows. Margherita “Marg” Peloso, a former associate producer, also chimed in and stated that any attempts to raise concern were “laughed at in meetings with the bosses.” This resulted in a culture where staff members felt “commanded to give a lot to the company without too much in return.” A former audio programmer, Isaac Hudd, mentioned how the rapid feature additions requested at the behest of Benzies at “breakneck speed” were too hasty for proper implementation, resulting in regressions where one team’s additions undid another team’s fixes. Hudd further stated, “And it does mess with you. You really do start to see the morale go down, and the little arguments start to happen. People burning the candle at both ends and starting to think: ‘What's the point?’” Earlier this month, between 250 and 300 BARB staff were laid off, most of whom were based in the Edinburgh studio. The IWGB union’s Game Workers Branch, on behalf of the staff members, announced that it would be taking legal action. For its part, Build A Rocket Boy claims in a statement that it would handle the redundancy process with “care and transparency” before mentioning that it was “committed to learning and growing.” In the statement, the studio further detailed, “Leslie and the entire senior management team take full responsibility for MindsEye’s initial launch. The version of the game that was released did not reflect the experience our community deserved.” Despite shipping hotfixes and Update 4 to address bugs and improve gameplay, former staff like Newbon call the whole situation a “wasted” opportunity for Scotland's gaming scene amid industry-wide layoffs, which have exceeded tens of thousands in recent years. The whole MindsEye fiasco has caused the lead actor to fear for future employment, and IO Interactive is taking a break from its third-party publishing ventures.Buy MindsEye on Amazon BBC

Title: CNN In Flux as Warner Bros. Discovery Mulls Sale: ‘People Want This Phase to Be Over’

Pro Available to WrapPRO members With prospective suitors from Comcast to Paramount eyeing CNN’s parent company, network staffers grapple with more uncertainty and hope for a responsible steward rather than a “scavenger” Just days after David Zaslav took the reins of a newly merged Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022, the chief executive shuttered CNN+, a $300 million streaming subscription service that barely got off the ground. Now, as the network prepares for next week’s launch of its streaming successor, “All Access,” Zaslav dropped more big news on staffers: WBD is for sale. Launching yet another streaming service amid another possible deal marks the latest twist in the CNN ownership saga, as the network has shuffled between corporate parents over the past decade, from Time Warner to the AT&T-owned WarnerMedia, in 2018, to the eventual Warner Bros. Discovery, in 2022. With the prospect of more changes coming, the mood inside CNN on Tuesday, one staffer told TheWrap, “is less concern about who buys us and more about the uncertainty of it all,” adding: “I think people just want to know they’ll have a job.” Such anxiety reflects the shifting stewardship and editorial strategies in recent years at CNN as the groundbreaking linear cable network charts its course in the digital world. Another staffer was more blunt: “People want this phase to be over.” Chatter about WBD selling off CNN alone has only ratcheted up amid the company’s decision to open itself for sale either as a whole or in parts, with Zaslav saying in a memo on Tuesday that “multiple parties” expressed interest in the company. This is separate from its prior plan to split into Warner Bros. (HBO Max, its film and television studios) and networks-and-sports-focused Discovery Global (cable networks including TNT and CNN, among others), and potentially accelerates the chaos to come. It’s just the latest bout of turbulence for CNN, which has seen a string of different CEOs since 2021, from Jeff Zucker to Chris Licht and now Mark Thompson, a former New York Times chief executive whose two-year CNN tenure has been focused on carrying the network into the digital age and who faces his greatest test next week with the “All Access” launch. CNN laid off 200 staffers earlier this year as part of a digital-and-streaming pivot and is banking on cord-cutters’ willingness to pay $6.99 a month for a selection of live and on-demand programming. The second staffer told TheWrap that, while their colleagues have sought some level of stability, they’re more eager to see a buyer who wants to let CNN fulfill its digital ambitions and capitalize on its expertise in international reporting. “I don’t think that the folks that have been in charge — beyond Mark Thompson, the folks that write Mark’s checks — have really had a full vision of what CNN can be and what its mission should be going into the future,” the staffer said. “My aspiration is that whoever comes in and buys us has a set of values that they not only communicate to us, but also to the world, and that they foster an independent journalism that we can be proud of.” A CNN spokesperson referred TheWrap to the WBD memo. Now, the network’s future could hinge on another owner, perhaps a company with a major stake in the news business, such as NBCUniversal parent Comcast, or a streamer like Netflix, both of which are reportedly among the interested parties. WBD’s announcement came after it rejected Paramount’s latest bid to purchase the company wholesale this week, according to the Wall Street Journal. Clearly, Paramount has already demonstrated a willingness to shake up a storied news brand, with newly minted CEO David Ellison quickly installing a conservative think tank veteran as a network watchdog and completing his $150 million purchase of The Free Press, opinion journalist Bari Weiss’ contrarian news outlet. Ellison installed Weiss as CBS News’ editor-in-chief, where she immediately leaned into coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, a subject close to her and Ellison. Expanding his reach into a 24/7 cable news operation like CNN would allow Ellison to tap into its expansive newsgathering operation and synergies (CNN primetime staple Anderson Cooper remains a “60 Minutes” correspondent, and “CBS Mornings” host Gayle King led a short-lived talk show with Charles Barkley between 2023 and 2024) while his own Paramount undergoes layoffs, staving off a potential total brain drain of talent. Should Comcast make a play for the combined Warner Bros. Discovery, they would once again gain a cable news network alongside its own broadcast news operation. Comcast is in the process of spinning off its cable networks, stripping NBC News of its cable counterpart MSNBC and forcing the two networks to move forward as distinct brands and without shared correspondents. Given this, Comcast may only be interested in the Warner Bros. studio assets and its valuable IP, so there’s reason to be skeptical CNN would be included in any deal. A potential Netflix acquisition of the whole company would bring the streamer fully into the news business, something its competitors have only toyed with. The company has said previously it would not enter the breaking news business, but as its scale has grown and its stances on other sectors — sports, ad-supported tiers — have changed, its ability to manage a large-scale news organization could prove more successful than Amazon’s subdued election night program with Brian Williams last year or the streaming components launched by ABC, NBC and CBS for their news programs. It would also give Netflix a new avenue to compete with Amazon, which was reportedly considering other ways to break into news, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday the company still has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” so it could be more interested in Warner Bros.’ studio and streaming business on its own. Netflix did not respond to an immediate request for comment. While there’s surely uncertainty about CNN’s future, Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino pointed out Sunday that “for all the talk about declining ratings,” the network is “immensely profitable.” “Now I fully understand the concept of cord cutting etc., but the place has a deep news infrastructure, a global presence and it’s in the middle of a restructuring to [adapt] to changes in the way people view news,” Gasparino said. “Moreover it’s still very relevant. People talk about it all the time. It’s in almost every airport and hotel lobby. I speak to bankers all the time, and they tell me this thing has massive potential, probably more so than the Free Press. Zas knows this.” CNN is currently valued at around $5 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, based on approximately $750 million in EBITDA, per the company’s earnings reports, and $1.75 billion in revenue at a 6.5 times multiple. For now, the network soldiers on as Warner Bros. Discovery continues its plan to split its streaming and studios businesses from its networks. But it’s that infrastructure and presence the second CNN staffer wants to see maintained should a sale go forward, one that doesn’t include the yearslong series of questions about what its corporate owners want to do with the 45-year-old news organization. “I hate to evoke Jeff Zucker, because that’s in the past, but when we had a different sort of corporate structure and we had Jeff Zucker in charge, we never heard anything about Time Warner or AT&T,” they said. “That stuff was so beyond anything that impacted us day to day, where now we’ve had, over the last few years, a consistent drumbeat of speculation and analysis about how our corporate ownership looks at us, what they want out of us, how they’re building a strategy around us. From the day that we were purchased, there was a conversation about whether we would be merged down the road, and questions about strategy more broadly, and I don’t think that that helps the process.” The staffer said a new suitor should want to honor CNN’s legacy of reporting, and appreciate its “enormous value if they let us do good work.” “My fear is that, given the landscape, there’s a good chance that a scavenger comes along and rides the wave of cable disintegration and irrelevance and either dismantles us for parts or merges us with something that already has a lot of redundancies and that we see CNN dwindle into irrelevance,” the staffer said.

Title: Amazon Plans to Replace 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, Report Says

The retail giant plans to expand its non-human workforce, with the goal of automating 75% of its operations, according to The New York Times. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Robots have been a staple at Amazon warehouses for more than a decade, performing tasks formerly completed by humans, including picking, sorting and moving packages. Now, Amazon plans to make human labor less necessary in its facilities by replacing more than half a million jobs with robots, The New York Times reports. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

Title: Earnings Preview: From Disney’s Kimmel Fallout to Paramount-WBD Drama, Our 5 Biggest Questions

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Expect fresh insight into linear and streaming as several big industry shifts are poised to play out over the coming quarters The final round of quarterly earnings updates for 2025 kick off with Netflix earnings on Tuesday afternoon, followed by Comcast next week and Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Disney in November. The financials will paint the latest picture on where these companies stand as they look to grow streaming profitability amid linear TV’s continued decline. Executives will also have the opportunity to address several major shifts set to take place across the media landscape in the coming quarters, including increased competition from YouTube, the copyright implications from OpenAI’s Sora 2, Comcast’s spin off of its cable network portfolio into Versant and David Ellison’s new vision for Paramount as the company pursues a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which said on Tuesday its fielding interest from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. “We were finally beginning to settle into a position where Netflix has won the streaming wars. It just feels like things are being thrown into flux again,” Third Bridge analyst John Conca told TheWrap. “We’re in a time of disruption.” Disney, Comcast and Paramount declined to comment on this story. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Here are five questions we hope to get more answers to as earnings season kicks off. After ending its quarterly disclosures at the end of 2024, Wall Street will be paying close attention to Netflix’s guidance around engagement, which has become the streamer’s new metric of success as it looks to scale its ad tier. Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese told TheWrap that Netflix is finally at a turning point where the company’s ad tier is poised to become a primary revenue driver in 2026. She noted that Wedbush’s quarterly consumer survey indicates “pretty strong stability” in Netflix subscriber growth. “The retention is largely due to their ad supported tier,” she said. “They have the lowest ad delivery rates of anyone in streaming and I think their ads are becoming more and more relevant as they get better at targeting. That will only get better over time.” UBS analyst John Hodulik expects a 17% increase in revenue and 25% increase in operating income as a result of subscriber growth, higher pricing and increased ad revenues. He believes the return of shows like “Squid Game” and “Wednesday,” as well as new hits like “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Untamed,” will provide a boost to engagement and monetization. He expects that trend to continue with its fourth-quarter slate, which includes “The Witcher,” “Stranger Things” and the NFL Christmas Day games. Netflix will also add video podcasts to its platform in 2026 as part of a new partnership with Spotify, so expect to hear some commentary around that. Though Netflix itself has also been floated as a potential WBD suitor, J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth emphasized its “certainly not an acquisitive company” and added that a large, complex deal would “likely bog the company down for an extended period of time and potentially invite regulatory scrutiny.” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also shaded big media mergers earlier this month, noting they “don’t have an amazing track record.” Disney will report its first earnings results since its temporary suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on ABC and affiliates owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting. The move, which came in response to the late night host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, triggered calls to cancel Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ subscriptions. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich expects Kimmel to have “little impact” on streaming churn in the quarter given the timing of billing cycles, though she predicted there could be a “modest” impact in Disney’s first fiscal quarter of 2026. On the advertising side, Seaport Research’s David Joyce estimated the Kimmel situation could have resulted in a $4.25 million hit, assuming a $30 average cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) and 1.77 million average viewers, but acknowledged that could be easily recouped. Antenna revealed on Monday that the monthly churn rate for Disney+ and Hulu doubled in September to 5% and 10%, respectively, though it’s unclear how much of that was related directly to Kimmel. An insider told TheWrap that Antenna’s percentages are higher than what Disney is seeing internally. “Disney ultimately, and effectively we believe, resolved its controversies over the past couple of weeks, but the immediate follow-on with planned streaming price increases might compound the cancellations and put the +10 [million] net adds guidance at risk — but not likely by a wide margin,” Joyce said. Notably, ESPN+ will no longer report its subscriber and average revenue per user metrics starting this quarter, with Disney+ and Hulu set to follow suit in the company’s first quarter of 2026. An Antenna spokesperson told TheWrap that the estimated cancellation volumes for Disney+ and Hulu totaled 3 million and 4.1 million, compared to the averages of 1.2 million and 1.9 million, respectively, in the last three months. Disney+ had around 2.18 million sign-ups during the month, while Hulu had just over 2.1 million sign-ups, per Antenna. In addition to Kimmel, Wall Street will be paying close attention to any additional financial guidance for 2026, as well as commentary around Disney CEO succession updates, its new ESPN streamer and its impact on cord-cutting, the efforts to combine Disney+ and Hulu into a standalone app in 2026, the financial impact of its NBA rights renewal and loss of F1 rights, the outlook for their linear business, recent price hikes at their U.S. theme parks and the impact from competition with Universal’s Epic Universe. Ellison will finally take questions from Wall Street after the closing of Skydance Media’s $8 billion merger as he and president Jeff Shell outline their vision and provide updates on the company’s efforts to achieve $2 billion in cost savings. Those efforts include thousands of upcoming layoffs which are expected to kick off as soon as next week, a review of its real estate portfolio and finding efficiencies in other areas such as procurement and workflow. Leadership also said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, as well as leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with Larry Ellison’s Oracle and move Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ to a unified tech stack next year. Additionally the company has been investing more in content, setting new media rights deals with the UFC and Zuffa Boxing, new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and striking deals with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers and James Mangold. “It will probably be a few quarters before we really have a good idea of what this vision truly is,” Conca said. “It’s exciting and invigorating that we have seen them make the moves that they’ve made so far, but we don’t know where this might all end up going.” Analysts will also have an opportunity to ask Paramount about its pursuit of all of Warner Bros. Discovery and larger M&A strategy on the heels of its $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. When asked during Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, Ellison dodged talk about the WBD bid, but said he sees “a lot” of “actionable” M&A possibilities in the near-term. “We would approach that through the lens of wanting to make more, not less,” Ellison said. Conca says he’ll also be looking for specifics around Paramount’s content spend, how a WBD acquisition may or may not change the plans for holding onto its linear networks and the timeline for ramping up its content production on the film side. Speaking of Warner Bros. Discovery, the company revealed on Tuesday that it has launched a review of strategic alternatives after “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for both the entire company and Warner Bros., its streaming and studios business that will separate from its linear networks business Discovery Global in April. The review comes as WBD reportedly rejected a $20 per share takeover bid from Paramount for being too low. Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield noted that, assuming the lowest price the WBD board is willing to entertain is $25 per share, the Ellisons could pay around $63 billion with $50 billion in cash, though he doesn’t believe they’d be interested in that option. They could also write a $30 billion check for WBD and raise $20 billion in new debt, along with issuing $12 billion to $13 billion of new Paramount stock to WBD shareholders. Additionally, analysts will be looking for any further guidance around HBO Max’s efforts to grow revenue, profitability and subscribers through its ongoing international expansion and looming password sharing crackdown, as well as the impact of WBD’s loss of its NBA rights to Amazon, NBCUniversal and Disney. Though it wasn’t included in the larger group, Warner notably reached a settlement with the league that will give TNT Sports and its portfolio of brands a global license to create, produce and distribute new and existing NBA content across its platforms, as well as international rights in Northern Europe and Latin America, excluding Mexico and Brazil. Morningstar Research analyst Matthew Dolgin told TheWrap it’s too soon to tell what the overall impact of the NBA loss will be, but that it’s an area he’ll be keeping an eye on. “Their recent pay TV renewals should keep the subscription line steady for now, but the extent of ad revenue declines and cash savings over the next couple of quarters will be important,” Dolgin said. Though many analysts have viewed Comcast as an ideal merger partner for WBD for years, the company faces difficulty in getting a deal done given its upcoming spin off of Versant, as well as the required financing for a competing bid against the world’s second richest man and potential regulatory hurdles from the Trump administration. “I would be very surprised if they were to get involved at this point. It seems like Paramount has the appetite to absorb both and then maybe deal with it later. I don’t see Comcast wanting to do that, at least as of now,” Conca said. “If we’re sitting here a year from now and there’s a full Warner Bros. Discovery unwinding and they’re spun off, I could see Comcast maybe getting involved for the studio piece and Versant getting involved for the cable networks, but I don’t see that now as they’re going through their own organizational reshuffle.” On the flip side, Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino believes that Comcast should “try hard to buy it,” arguing it would have “much to gain” and that it could “fix NBCU’s ~$30B undervaluation.” Supino said Comcast could get around the political and financing challenges by issuing new stock to WBD, eliminating its “super voting” share structure and appointing a new chairman and CEO given Trump’s repeated criticism of Brian Roberts. (Comcast recently announced it would elevate Comcast president Mike Cavanagh to co-CEO alongside Roberts, though the latter said the pair would work together for “years to come.”) He added that NBCU could sweeten its bid with a position for WBD CEO David Zaslav in the combined company. Outside of the WBD bid conversation, analysts will keep an eye out for any positive momentum for Comcast’s broadband business, which has suffered declines in recent quarters due to increased competition, and any further guidance that can be shared about Versant’s outlook. In a first glimpse at its financials ahead of the spin off, Comcast disclosed that Versant’s profits fell 16% to $670 million and revenue fell 6% to $3.42 billion in the first half of 2025. They’ll also be paying close attention to Peacock’s growth and how its recent price increase and NBCUniversal’s new 11-year media rights deal with the NBA may impact its profitability efforts. “With the NBA contract beginning in this year’s fourth quarter, I don’t think third quarter sales, subscribers or profits can be expected to be a trend,” Dolgin said. “We’ll need to wait until next year to see if the NBA is bearing fruit and allowing for a better outlook for Peacock, which we’ve seen as the laggard.”

Title: Trump is attracting investment to the US – but at a huge cost to workers and the environment

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.5shr7e5jm Share article Print article Early in his second presidency, Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs was met with widespread scepticism. Critics warned of economic decline and a global backlash. Yet the current landscape for the United States paints a more complex picture. Less than a year into his second term in office, the White House claims that Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US. It also proclaims that Trump has secured trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2025 alone. Other voices, however, estimate that these commitments will amount to just a fraction of that. So what’s the true picture? Much of this FDI is going into the US’s burgeoning semiconductor sector. This inward investment is indeed a stark reversal from the post-1991 trend of outbound American capital, when US firms raced to set up factories in countries where it was cheaper to manufacture. And the surge is bolstered by commitments of US$300 billion (£225 billion) in capital investment commitments from tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. These investments reflect both Trump’s aggressive diplomacy and his close relationship with Silicon Valley’s tech elite. Despite concerns about a tech bubble, these investments signal a deepening state-private partnership, and a reorientation of priorities with a view to coming out on top in the global AI race. Central to this strategy is the reshaping of global supply chains. At a conference of venture capitalists in March, US vice-president J.D. Vance criticised US firms for their reliance on cheap overseas labour. He warned of the risks of losing the US’s technological advantage, especially to China. The solution, Vance and Trump argue, is to bring investments and jobs back home. But does this logic – backed by massive domestic and foreign investment – translate into the kind of reshoring (when operations that were previously moved abroad transfer back to the country) that delivers good jobs? In our new book Capitalist Value Chains, Christin Bernhold and I argue that global supply chains have made labour exploitation and environmental degradation worse. Efforts by both former president Joe Biden and Trump to contain China’s rise reflect not a retreat from globalisation, but a strategic reconfiguration of supply chains. In the early days of globalisation, American administrations supported China’s rise as the workshop of the world and an exporter of low-cost consumer goods to the US. But over the last 15 years, the US has increased efforts to contain China’s technological rise, while continuing to rely on its cheap imports. Trump’s tariffs on China represent a step change. The US’s strategy now seems to have shifted from slowing China’s advance to attempts to inflict severe economic damage on the Chinese economy in order to reduce it to a subordinate, rather than rival, trading partner. So will these investments create quality employment? And what are the environmental consequences? The likely answers are probably not, and probably terrible. Reshoring doesn’t mean abandoning global supply chains. Recently, Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on China in response to its restrictions on rare earth exports. Western industries – especially automotive and defence – warned that this escalation could break supply chains. US chip-dependent sectors such as electronics, defence and telecoms still rely heavily on Chinese rare earths. Even if the US succeeds in reshaping supply chains, it doesn’t guarantee the creation of good jobs. Despite Trump’s pro-labour rhetoric, his administration’s actions tell a different story. In March 2025, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency laid off 216,000 federal workers. Collective bargaining rights were stripped from 400,000 employees across agencies like Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. The White House also revoked the US$15 per hour minimum wage requirement for publicly-funded businesses. Traditional sectors are suffering. Since April, machinery giant John Deere has cut more than 2,000 jobs, citing cost increases blamed on Trump’s tariffs. The big three carmakers – Ford, GM and Stellantis – claim that tariffs will cost them US$7 billion in lost earnings in 2025, with severe consequences for pay and jobs. Will the tech sector’s massive capital spends offset these losses? Most of the US$300 billion pledged by firms like Apple and Amazon is earmarked for AI infrastructure: high-powered data centres, custom chips, graphics processing units and cloud networks. These are capital-intensive projects that generate short-term construction jobs but offer little in the way of long-term employment. Simultaneously, tech companies are downsizing as they substitute AI for human labour. Microsoft announced layoffs of 6,000 and 9,000 employees from its 228,000-strong global labour force in May and July 2025, including 800 in Washington, Microsoft’s home state. And what about the quality of the remaining jobs? At Amazon, for example, the company’s software engineers have described how it is using AI to cut jobs and speed up work. According to reports, tasks that previously took weeks are now expected to be completed in days. One engineer told journalists that his team was halved in size, but is expected to produce the same amount of code, using AI tools. The environmental costs of AI are mounting. Researchers have found that data centres already consume 4.4% of the US’s electricity. By 2028, AI could require as much power as 22% of American households use annually. This surge in demand, combined with federal budget cuts to green energy initiatives, is diverting renewable energy away from broader decarbonisation efforts such as hydrogen tech projects, battery plants and upgrades to the electric grid. These figures are only set to rise if the surge continues. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels – particularly coal and natural gas – are expected to supply more than 40% of the additional electricity needed by data centres until 2030. Trump’s push towards AI, coupled with his tariff regime and alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite, may reshape the economy and global supply chains – but not in favour of workers or the planet. The promise of revitalised manufacturing and job creation masks deeper risks: automation, weakened labour protections and escalating environmental harm.

ST PHOTO: KELVIN CHNG Krist Boo Published Oct 20, 2025, 04:14 AM Updated Oct 20, 2025, 07:13 AM SINGAPORE – Software engineers in Singapore are less likely than their global peers to lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI), owing to strong government support and the Republic’s proximity to an array of tech firms, say talent and technology players. The rise of vibe coding – where one can build apps and websites using word commands – is especially ominous for this group of computer experts. vibe coding Mr Eugene Yang, managing director for Singapore and Hong Kong at technology consultancy Palo IT, said the signs are that companies here are already reducing demand for junior developers, traditionally hired through offshore markets such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. But Singapore’s smaller, more specialised tech workforce offers an opportunity. He said: “We could emerge as the AI orchestration hub for South-east Asia, managing AI agents rather than human coders.” Managing AI agents – bots that can work and learn independently without human supervision – to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks is beginning to draw attention among enterprises. Ms Rohini Saluja, managing director at real estate services firm CBRE, said the AI orchestration layer is where human oversight, ethical design and complex system integration are needed. These areas play up Singapore’s strengths – but offshore information technology (IT) offices will not disappear, she said. She noted: “Take an example of data labelling for AI training. Despite improvements in optical character recognition technology, companies continue to value quality, accuracy and the human lens for such data. “Such roles will not be feasible in higher-cost markets.” Likewise, Mr Ravi Nippani, head of regional industries and solutions at professional services firm Mercer Asia, expects businesses here to keep using offshore teams. These remote teams offer specialised skills and scale for large IT projects, as well as personalised customer interactions. They also help businesses spread their geographical operation risks. “Companies should not rush to cut offshore IT offices but rather consider transforming their offshore teams,” Mr Nippani advised. For instance, offshore offices could be upgraded from routine coding to higher-value tasks such as AI management, complex problem-solving and system design, he said. Singapore is home to around 4,500 tech firms, including the regional operations of major global tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Director for AI innovation at AI Singapore Laurence Liew expects firms to bring some of their overseas roles home when Singapore is able to offer enough AI workers at competitive wage levels. The Government has a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029, and is supporting it with apprenticeships, scholarships, reskilling initiatives and public-private collaborations. a goal to have 15,000 AI professionals in the workforce before 2029 It has launched programmes such as the Skills Pathway for Cloud, offered by the Singapore Computer Society in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture Singapore; IMDA’s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; and AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme. Skills Pathway for Cloud, Tech Immersion and Placement Programme; AI Singapore’s AI Apprenticeship Programme Mr Liew said software engineers everywhere are using AI or agentic coding tools today. AI Singapore’s apprenticeship initiative aims to give the local workforce an edge by injecting AI workers with diverse backgrounds into the economy. He said: “Not all are software or computer science graduates, which makes the programme all the more valuable, as they bring their past domain experience to solve business problems.” Almost all its trainees, ranging from fresh graduates to mid-career job switchers, are hired within six months of graduation. About six in 10 find jobs before graduation, he added. The programme will produce more than 500 graduates over 20 cohorts by the middle of 2026. While engineers here are already expected to be more productive with the help of AI coding tools, higher salaries are not in the offing for now, said Mr Ethan Ang, chief executive of tech career platform NodeFlair. “The market remains employer-driven, especially after the wave of tech layoffs, and companies generally view AI adoption as a way to improve competitiveness and efficiency, rather than as a justification for higher salary negotiations,” he said. NodeFlair estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 of the 214,000 tech workers in Singapore are software engineers and developers making a median monthly salary of $6,750. Regional director John Borneman of recruitment firm Hays expects median salaries for this group to stay flat in the next 12 months. But he expects the ones who have upskilled to command more pay. “The rise of low-code platforms is reducing the need for teams writing boilerplate code, so the more skilled you are in architecture and modelling, the greater value you will add to an organisation, and the bigger the upside for your pay packet,” he said.

Title: Hideo Kojima Says AI Is “A Friend,” Not a Threat to Creativity in Game Development

Hideo Kojima recently shared an optimistic view on artificial intelligence, framing it not as a threat to the games industry or to human creativity for that matter, but a collaborative “friend’ that can handle the more time-consuming aspects of game development. In a recent interview with Wired Japan, Kojima highlighted that while many in the industry use AI to generate ideas, he views it differently, stating: “A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas. But I think of AI as more of a friend… I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency.” Kojima’s perspective on the use of AI and its role in creative workflows comes amid a time when many companies like Activision, Level-5, and Capcom are using AI. A recent survey in June and July found that 32% of CESA member companies are using AI to develop in-house game engines, extend to visual game assets, generate text, and assist in programming. It’s pretty surprising how much of a foothold AI already has in gaming, considering some companies have been quite open about their use of AI in pretty much everything from visual upscaling to code generation, even as user and developer pushback continues on multiple mediums. Kojima's approach shows how AI can be used to streamline monotonous tasks such as animation, motion capture, and NPC behaviors without supplanting the core creative process in video game development. He further added in the Wired interview, saying, I’d like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower the cost and cut down on time. It’s more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead, creating together with AI. Kojima’s stance on the use of AI stands in stark contrast to the push toward full automation in some sectors, maintaining AI as a tool for efficiency rather than a complete substitute. For instance, during the development of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kojima Productions employed machine learning for scanning actors, including Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna, to create digital models. While Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been praised for its high-fidelity visuals, realistic character models, and facial animations, Kojima himself views the result as merely “okay” and seeks even greater realism in future endeavors like OD and Physint. At the New Global Sport Conference in Riyadh in August, he discussed a few challenges during Death Stranding 2’s production, and mentioned: We scanned and we made a rig, an AI machine learning rig. We took so much time and made sure that we scanned them into digital, but made sure that they move analog in a way. And it took so much time. Looking back, I think it’s okay. But my next project, I think I want to make it more realistic. Debates over the use of AI in the game industry continue unabated, even as it remains the leading cause for layoffs in an industry struggling to find sustained profitability. While some developers are aiming for total automation, Kojima’s vision for using AI as a co-creator could help reduce game development costs, while making sure humans remain at the helm of innovation.Buy Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on Amazon Wired - Instagram

Title: Banjo-Kazooie director Gregg Mayles leaves Rare after 36 years as he announces exit on X

Gregg Mayles, the director behind Banjo-Kazooie, has finally bid farewell to Rare after an impressive 36 years at the British studio. Mayles, who joined Rare in 1989 straight out of high school, announced his exit on X in poetic alliteration, titled “A Rather Resplendent Rewarding Rare Ramble,” fittingly referencing the rhyming dialogue that defined Banjo-Kazooie. The poem basically recounts his journey, from his early days ignoring banking for game design to contributing to hits like Battletoads, Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Viva Piñata, and Sea of Thieves, while expressing gratitude to fans and colleagues. He ended the post with the line “Now time to start new tales to tell, Farewell to Rare, he waves, farewell!” Over his tenure, Mayles worked on 30 games, helping shape Rare’s golden era during the Nintendo 64 heyday. He contributed to classics such as the 1998 platformer Banjo-Kazooie, which sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide and spawned sequels like Banjo-Tooie in 2000. He also contributed to many other beloved titles, including the 1994 beat ‘em up Battletoads, the Donkey Kong series starting with Donkey Kong Country in 1994, the 2003 Xbox horror-comedy Grabbed by the Ghoulies, the 2006 life sim Viva Pinata, and most recently, directed the live-service hit pirate adventure multiplayer game, Sea of Thieves, which launched in 2018 and has since amassed more than 40 million players across all platforms. This announcement comes amid a turbulent and dark period for Rare, following Microsoft’s acquisition of the studio in 2002 for $375 million, after which it shifted focus from Nintendo to Xbox. While Sea of Thieves stands as Rare’s most successful release, the studio had nonetheless faced many hiccups throughout the years, like 2013's Kinect Sports. Notable here is ambitious open-world adventure Everwild, whose development was being overseen by Gregg Mayles himself. The game was announced in 2019 and had been in development for over five years. However, Microsoft canceled Everwild in July 2025 as part of broader layoffs, affecting up to 9000 employees company-wide. This also included cuts at Rare and the scrapping of The Initiative's Perfect Dark Reboot, another project tied to Rare’s legacy. Sources report that the cancellation of Everwild, after nearly a decade of troubled development and multiple reboots, likely influenced Mayles' decision to leave Rare. However, he didn’t specify the reason in his post on X. Gregg Mayles - X
