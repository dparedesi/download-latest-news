THIS WEEK SAW the announcement of jobs at risk on different sides of the market, with hundreds likely to be lost at Amazon and courier firm Fastway. If it feels like this is becoming more common, it’s because it is more common. The figures confirm your thoughts. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office showed a spike of 9.4% in ‘job destructions’ compared to the same period last year. Following the latest announcement of jobs under threat, The Journal asked its readers on whether they had suffered through this over the past year. And in response we heard of the range of emotions experienced after they lost the jobs they had held for years. Some of these roles that were lost were in high-profile multinationals, with difficulties also found upon returning to the jobs market. A certain type of redundancy that has reared its head in recent months is the so-called silent layoff – where a smaller number of jobs are trimmed by a company without fanfare or media attention. The Journal has reported on claims of similar happening at TikTok’s Dublin office for instance. Some of these silent layoffs have been taking place well before this year, but may be getting noticed more due to a perceived tightening of the jobs market. Aidan from Co Offaly worked for a gas supplier for almost 20 years, but suddenly found himself out of a job in a round of cuts. Five people lost their work, this reader recalled: Another person told The Journal that they were recently made redundant from PayPal after over a decade of employment. But the sacking didn’t come as a shock as the reader said the company has been “doing redundancies every 6 months or so for the last 2-3 years. They tend to be in small numbers so it’s not reported a lot”. “Friends of mine from my department were made redundant earlier this year so it wasn’t a huge shock to me but I was still surprised when it happened,” said the reader, who asked to remain anonymous. The blow was cushioned by a redundancy payment: “I won’t mention the amount but it was generous.” Another reader, Cork-based and working in the tech sector, said ‘restructuring’ was the reason for his layoff – and for his lack of shock when it happened. He agreed that the short-to-medium term outlook for other companies means they are either cutting jobs or not looking to hire right now. “In my experience, it’s a challenging market for job seekers. I was a jobseeker in 2018 and 2022 – tougher market in 2025. There are lots of candidates right now for non-specialist tech roles like Project Managers/Program Managers/Product Managers/Recruiters.” A Morgan McKinley report into the Irish labour market detected this same trend. These adjustments are “not immediately visible” in headline figures as they don’t require a formal notification to the Department of Enterprise – and may well help avoid negative headlines. The notifications are supposed to happen if the layoffs meet a certain threshold of a workforce, which is 30 jobs or more at larger employers. What’s driving these silent layoffs? According to Morgan McKinley, it’s most often due to a combination of global economic uncertainty, AI-led transformation and nervousness around US tariffs. AI-led transformation was mentioned by a couple of our readers who had recently lost jobs. One, a translator, said half of his department was made redundant “because they believe in AI translations, although it is not nearly as good, or nearly as precise”. “There was a redundancy package,” he said, but added: “More than the bare minimum, but less than you would expect from an IT company with good revenues and a global brand.” There’s also the not so silent layoffs. Advertisement As with Amazon and Fastway this week, major employers like Oracle have also said they’re reducing their Irish workforce. Another example of this happened to one man working at Intel’s plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare. This reader “drew the short straw” and found himself the only one in his team cut as part of the trimming to the company’s Irish operations. Recent days have marked his last day at the company he joined six years ago via a project management subcontractor. “I was told 4 weeks ago that our department had to be cut by one and I drew the short straw. It absolutely came as a shock because there is a lot of work lined up for next year,” the man said. Earlier this year, Intel announced it was cutting 195 jobs, as it battles to catch up with competitors globally. Soon after a catering company contracted for the plant reduced its headcount by 37 jobs. This man who worked for Intel has to wait to find new work through the project management firm that subcontracts him to sites. However, there has been little success just yet in finding new work. “I’ve been finding it tough the past month since I was told, very few calls or email replies regarding new positions. Leaving Ireland isn’t out of the question but I’ll certainly be leaving Dublin in the near future,” he said. Our reader who lost their job in Paypal said they are yet to begin hunting for a new job, having heard of difficulties from previously laid off friends in their old office. “They haven’t had great luck searching for jobs so far. There doesn’t seem to be many jobs going in our skillset,” this person said. “I don’t feel hopeful that I’ll get a similar job or near to the same salary.” Brian had been working in Dublin as a lecturer in English for international students but lost the job in recent months amid a fall in enrollments. Brian, who received a redundancy package of €4,020, described the search for fresh work as “awful”. “The last time I was out of work (just after Covid) I got lots of replies and interviews,” he said. “While these didn’t always work out, at least there was a responsiveness. That seems to be gone.” Instead, he feels the job search these days is “like AI is talking to itself”. He explained: “I have to use ChatGPT to try to edit my CV so that my skills appear transferable, but I’m 100% certain they are using ChatGPT to filter applications.” It’s almost as if there is a “kind of contempt from prospective employers” that wasn’t there before, the lecturer added. “I don’t just mean not having any response to an application. I’ve had several semi-formal and formal phone calls and online interviews that have had no follow up at all.” John worked for a cryptocurrency firm and has also struggled after being laid off, which couldn’t have been at a worse time given he had just got engaged and bought a house. “As I live several hours from Dublin, I would need something remote or hybrid,” John said. “Finding work has been difficult as the market is very bad right now.” Is leaving Ireland an option for some of our readers? In the main, no. Several of those we spoke to who have found themselves unemployed have been landed in this position after years with the one employer, but at a period of time where they have children or have laid other roots by buying a home. A more hopeful experience was described by Jason from Co Dublin, who found out via a Microsoft Teams meeting that he and dozens more colleagues were being made redundant by their insurance firm. The company was moving the jobs back to the US. “It was not expected so abruptly,” Jason recalled. “We were half way through our house renovation and expecting our fourth child. Losing my job was not in our plans.” After three months spent drawing the dole, he found himself “fortunate enough to be offered a good position within another company within the same industry”.

Title: Amazon’s Lord of the Rings MMO canceled after layoffs as former developer laments ‘Y’all would have loved it'

In unfortunate news for J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth series and MMO fans, Amazon Games’ Lord of the Rings MMO has been quietly canceled after layoffs hit the company’s gaming sector. The cancellation has been confirmed via a now-deleted LinkedIn post (spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun) by former Amazon Games senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine. Ashleigh, who had been with the studio for over nine years, detailed in the LinkedIn post: This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it). It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this. I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve met there. Amazon announced massive corporate layoffs, which hit 14,000 staff members across the company. It’s reported that more employees will be laid off from its 350,000 workforce. Amid the layoffs, Amazon Games’ crew was hit the hardest, with an “undisclosed” number of cuts across its studios in San Diego and Irvine, as well as the central publishing team. The Vice President of Amazon Games confirmed the layoffs in an announcement, stating, “We have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development.” The company is stepping away from the MMO space to focus on casual titles, AI projects, and its cloud gaming platform, Luna. This is the second time Amazon’s Middle-earth MMO project has been canceled. Earlier in 2019, Amazon announced a partnership with Leyou Technologies and Athlon Games Studio. However, the deal was scrapped amid contract discrepancies when Tencent acquired Leyou. Later in 2023, Amazon joined hands with Embracer Group’s Middle-earth Enterprises for publishing rights for the Lord of the Rings MMO. Fans are disappointed upon hearing the loss of what could have been a new take on Tolkien’s universe. Layoffs have also hit Amazon’s New World as active development for the MMO has ended. New World’s Season 10: Nighthaven was the final major content update. Amazon announced that it would keep New World servers online through 2026 and give players 6 months' notice before the servers are sunset. Rock Paper Shotgun

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his warnings about how artificial intelligence will affect the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. Just four so-called AI hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon—are expected to boost capital expenditures to $420 billion next fiscal year from $360 billion this year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI alone has announced a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure deals in recent weeks with AI-ecosystem companies like Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle. When asked if such investments can pay off without destroying jobs, Hinton replied, “I believe that it can’t. I believe that to make money you’re going to have to replace human labor.” The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. In fact, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level, and an analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. And this past week, Amazon announced 14,000 layoffs, largely in middle management. While CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was due to “culture” and not AI, a memo he sent in June predicted a smaller corporate workforce “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Despite the potential downside for workers, Hinton also sees benefits from AI. When asked if he would go back in time and stop AI from developing, he paused and said he doesn’t know. “It’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he explained. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good in healthcare and education. It’ll do tremendous good, and in fact if you think about it increasing productivity in many, many industries, that should be good.” The problem ultimately is not due to AI itself, but “on how we organize society,” Hinton added. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: These are the 3 signs your company is about to make layoffs: career experts

With Amazon, UPS, Target, and Skydance Paramount all announcing layoffs this week, many workers are worried their companies will be next to make cuts. But experts say there are three signs that a round of redundancies is on the horizon — so take note to avoid being blindsided. “Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they’re taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,” Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting, told CNBC. The first sign is “a slowdown in hiring,” recruiter Jalonni Weaver revealed to the website. If new roles don’t get posted, or vacant roles aren’t filled quickly, “it’s never a good sign that you’re doing well financially.” Meanwhile, a change in corporate messaging is the second sign that the company could be looking to let some staffers go. “There’s a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,” consultant Rosie Nestingen told CNBC. Rey Ramirez of Thrive HR Consulting agrees. He advises employees to look out for phrases such as “we need to be more efficient” as a potential sign that the business could boot people in the near future. Thirdly, a reduction in some workers’ hours is another indication that layoffs are looming. “Employees can’t afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,” Ramirez explained, labelling a reduction in hours as effectively “quiet firing.” Other tactics, such as “return to office” mandates, are also deliberately designed to reduce headcount without the company needing to announce official layoffs. Still, it paints a picture of a company that could be mulling cuts in the near future. Amid a sluggish economy and anxiety about AI, Weaver advises all workers to keep their resumes up to date, just in case. Even if you aren’t planning on jumping jobs, the recruiter recommends applying to other roles on occasion in order to make sure your CV and skills at interviews remain “competitive.”

Title: AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs

By Rae Witte Published Nov 1, 2025 9:45 AM EDT There’s no question that the job market is a mess. According to Labor Department data, nearly two million Americans have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, the highest figure since 2022. And it’s hitting white collar jobs hard: this week alone, Amazon cut its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs, UPS cut 34,000 operational workforce positions, and Target and Paramount axed 1,800 and 1,000 jobs, respectively. Many are blaming those cuts on AI. Everyone from Senator Bernie Sanders to Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is wringing their hands about the tech’s effect on employment. Mike Hoffman, CEO of growth advisory firm SBI, told the Wall Street Journal that productivity surged when he cut his software development team by 80 percent. And Meta just culled 600 employees from the AI Superintelligence lab — after dropping billions to beef up the team — and blamed advancements in automation. Others aren’t so sure. New research found that even the world’s strongest AI agents struggled to perform the vast majority of tasks that companies currently lean on independent contractors for. According to a recent study from MIT, 95 percent of companies that adopt AI see zero meaningful revenue growth. Some companies are finding they’re forced to hire contractors to fix AI’s mistakes, or even to re-hire staff they terminated in favor of the tech. It all raises an interesting counter-possibility: maybe instead of AI actually replacing human-level intellectual labor, bosses are running with the narrative that it’s ready to replace human workers to justify layoffs — when what’s really happening is they’re offloading work onto a smaller human workforce, or forcing their overburdened remaining employees to produce lower quality results. The reality is that there are other major headwinds dragging down the economy. The US is now in a perpetual state of political uncertainty that has directly impacted many employers. President Donald Trump’s tariffs were announced, postponed, instated, rolled back, rinsed and repeated; his restrictive immigration policies and deportations are shrinking the workforce and increasing labor costs; cutting the $7,500 consumer incentive for electric vehicles is forcing layoffs in that sector. AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs, in other words, and if it keeps improving, it may eventually pose a real threat to jobs. But for now, it feels more like a bogeyman to rationalize short-term cost cutting — and any companies that indulge in it may find that they’re undermining their reputation and institutional knowledge for years to come.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you're one of the millions of unemployed Americans looking for work right now, it's clear the job market is tough. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in August, the number of job seekers outpaced available openings in the US for the first time since April 2021. The shift comes amid a wave of layoffs this year across major employers, including Amazon, Meta, and GM. For many out-of-work Americans, it's easy to feel discouraged — but there's still hope. WalletHub has ranked the best and worst cities in the US for job hunters, showing where your odds might be strongest and weakest. To find out where you'll have the best chance at landing, keeping, and actually enjoying a job, WalletHub compared all 50 states using 34 metrics that reflect job-market strength and economic health. These include factors such as employment growth, median annual income, average commute time, job security, and even the likelihood that artificial intelligence could take your job in the future. WalletHub found that many of the best states for jobs are clustered in New England, the Upper Midwest, and the Great Plains, with Texas being the lone Southern state. Despite their regional and industry differences, from tech in Massachusetts to agriculture in the Dakotas, these states share common strengths: low unemployment, solid job growth, and business-friendly environments. "The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits," said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo. These are the 10 best and 10 worst states for job prospects, according to WalletHub. Business Insider added September median home sale prices from Redfin and 2024 median household income data from the Missouri Census Data Center's ACS Profiles. Jump to

US stock market November 2025 forecast looks bullish as Wall Street enters its best month of the year. The S&P 500 gained 2.3% in October, the Nasdaq 4.7%, and the Dow 2.5%, extending its six-month winning streak. The Fed cut rates by 25 bps, fueling optimism after Amazon’s $180.2 billion Q3 revenue beat and AMD’s 58% monthly jump. With AI stocks surging, inflation easing, and rents falling, investors eye November for fresh highs — unless rising CRE delinquencies or job losses trigger a pullback.

Title: YouTube CEO emphasizes AI as the next technological frontier

YouTube is embarking on a transformative journey into artificial intelligence (AI), as CEO Neal Mohan outlined plans to position the platform at the forefront of this technological shift. In a memo to employees earlier in October, Mohan declared, "the next frontier for YouTube is AI", unveiling a significant reorganization of the company’s product and engineering divisions, which will take effect on November 5, 2025. To better align YouTube with its AI-driven ambitions, the company will restructure its operations into three primary product organizations, all reporting directly to Mohan. Johanna Voolich will oversee Viewer Products, managing areas such as Search and Discovery, the Living Room app, infrastructure, and Trust and Safety. Meanwhile, the Creator and Community Products group, temporarily under Voolich’s leadership, will focus on YouTube Shorts, Live, and expanding generative AI tools to assist creators. Christian Oestlien will lead the Subscription Products division, handling YouTube Premium, Music, TV, and other over-the-top initiatives. The company is also making internal changes to improve efficiency and collaboration. The UX organization, led by JT, will integrate with Scott’s engineering team to streamline processes. Similarly, the Shopping group, under Travis’s leadership, will continue to report to Scott. Mohan emphasized that these adjustments aim to strengthen decision-making, enhance accountability, and ensure high-growth areas receive the necessary focus and investment. As part of the restructuring, YouTube introduced a voluntary exit program for U.S.-based employees within Mohan’s direct reporting organization. The program offers eligible employees the option to leave the company with a severance package, although the precise number of eligible employees remains undisclosed. A YouTube spokesperson clarified that the program is voluntary and does not involve layoffs or role eliminations. Details of the program are being communicated individually to those eligible. Mohan has been vocal about AI’s potential to transform YouTube’s platform and services. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he stated, "AI in service of human creativity" is a central focus for the company. He explained how AI can enable creators to generate ideas, develop visuals, and enhance video production more efficiently. "I do think creation is an area where AI will help enormously by making the process easier, faster, and more powerful", Mohan added. The new Creator and Community Products organization will lead the development of these AI-powered tools. This commitment to AI mirrors broader trends in the tech industry. Major companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google’s DeepMind also recently announced significant organizational changes to integrate AI into their operations. However, unlike many of these companies, YouTube’s approach does not involve layoffs, instead opting for voluntary departures to adjust its structure. The reorganization comes at a time of robust financial performance for YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet. The company recently reported its first-ever quarter with revenue exceeding $100 billion, with net income rising 33 percent year-over-year. YouTube contributed significantly to this growth, generating $10.26 billion in ad revenue during the third quarter of 2025, a 15 percent increase from the previous year and ahead of Wall Street expectations. Acknowledging the platform’s success, Mohan highlighted YouTube’s evolution. The platform has paid more than $100 billion to its creators, maintained its position as the leading streaming service in the United States for over two years, and grown its user base to 125 million YouTube Premium and Music subscribers, along with 8 million YouTube TV subscribers. Despite this growth, Mohan noted that the core leadership structure "has not evolved in a decade", necessitating the reorganization to better align with the platform’s current scale and complexity. In his memo to employees, Mohan expressed optimism about YouTube’s trajectory. "It’s an incredibly exciting time at YouTube, and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead", he wrote. "Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform." The changes, he noted, are designed to enable the company to "make the most of this opportunity" and ensure leadership teams are well-equipped to prioritize high-growth areas. As YouTube moves forward with its restructuring, its focus remains clear: leveraging AI to enhance both content creation and user experiences, signaling a new chapter of innovation for the world’s largest video platform. The changes will officially take effect on November 5, 2025, marking the beginning of what Mohan described as "an incredibly exciting time at YouTube."

Title: How Amazon flipped the script on a challenging week

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tuesday brought 14,000 job cuts and fresh AI concerns. By Thursday, investors were cheering. It was a turbulent week for Amazon and its CEO Andy Jassy, marked by historic layoffs and rising doubts about AI, followed by a swift 48-hour rebound that reassured investors. Wall Street is impressed — Amazon shares hit record highs on Friday — though questions remain. "Amazon isn't perfect, and we are seeing increasing urgency in defending their cloud leadership position and reclaiming some of the unique culture," Baird's senior analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider. "Jassy's strategy is proving successful, even if there are still some wrinkles to work out." Tuesday's layoffs fueled concerns about Amazon's AI prowess, sparking questions over whether the cuts reflected slowing growth or that efficiency gains were paying off. The company said it was a preemptive move that makes it "leaner." Even before the layoffs, Amazon was contending with a widening perception that it was trailing in AI, with a top Wall Street analyst calling it an "AI laggard." On top of that, Amazon's yearlong push to streamline its culture and cut bureaucracy had yet to deliver stronger shareholder returns. Jassy has cut the manager-to-employee ratio by 15% this year as part of a broader push to instill discipline and reshape Amazon's culture. Until earlier this week, it was the only one of the seven largest tech firms to underperform the broader market over the past five years. Investors were especially worried about Amazon Web Services' slow growth, the company's high-margin cloud unit. Though it maintains a far larger revenue base, AWS' growth has lagged behind competitors such as Microsoft and Google. "AWS revenue growth acceleration is a must," CFRA wrote in a research note last week. Amazon put those concerns to rest on Thursday. The company's third-quarter earnings topped expectations, and it raised its capital spending forecast amid surging demand. AWS reported $33 billion in sales, a 20% increase, its fastest growth since 2022. The company also made a number of disclosures that showcased its progress in AI, including: Wall Street loved what it saw. "The AWS unlock is here," wrote Evercore's Mark Mahaney. Financial firm William Blair called it "a key step in reclaiming the narrative," while Barclays wrote in a note that "the past 48 hours have gone a long way to dispelling concerns." "AWS is gaining momentum," Jassy said during Thursday's earnings call. Still, skepticism remains. AWS may have pioneered the cloud, but the rise of AI is reshaping the landscape and giving rivals fresh ways to compete. Some of its flagship AI products have failed to gain much traction. And it didn't help that Jassy sidestepped an analyst's question on Thursday to specify how much of AWS' growth came from AI versus its core infrastructure business. DA Davidson's Gil Luria, who remains bullish on Amazon, told Business Insider that AWS still hasn't matched Microsoft or Google Cloud's lead in AI mindshare, and has plenty of catching up to do. "Amazon has been the slowest of the three hyperscalers in commercializing AI," Luria said. There's also uncertainty about whether the layoffs are over. Jassy said Thursday that the latest cuts weren't driven by cost pressures or AI, but by cultural alignment, implying the shake-up isn't done. "It's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do," Jassy said. Have a tip?

Title: CEO Andy Jassy says Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs weren’t about cutting costs or AI taking jobs: ‘It’s culture’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/01/ceo-andy-jassy-amazon-layoffs-about-culture-not-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:03:00Z

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Amazon’s CEO has finally spoken up about the company’s 14,000 layoffs earlier this week, and he claims the motive was not at all financial. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, CEO Andy Jassy said laying off those employees was about a mismatched cultural fit—and nothing else. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said about the job cuts. “It’s culture.” The job cuts this week, which mostly affected middle managers, follow a June memo in which Jassy said Amazon will need fewer employees thanks to the “efficiency gains” brought on by AI. In a separate memo announcing this week’s layoffs, Amazon’s senior vice president of people said the layoffs were about adapting to “transformative technology.” Jassy also mentioned Amazon’s business has grown over the past years. The company has about 1.55 million total employees, with 350,000 corporate employees alone. As of December 2019, prior to the pandemic, the company had 798,000 total employees, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you’re in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he said. This type of growth can lead to consequences, Jassy added. “Sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line,” he said. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Amazon joins other companies such as Salesforce, Target, and Paramount who have together laid off thousands of workers in the past few months. Several large companies have cited AI as a reason for hiring pauses or layoffs recently, said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell this week, adding that the Fed is “watching that very carefully.” To be sure, a study of Goldman Sachs investment bankers this week found only 11% of their corporate clients were actively laying people off due to AI. In contrast, about a third of companies in the technology, media, and telecommunications category are reducing headcount because of AI. During the quarterly earnings call, Jassy seemed to echo the sentiment, saying the “technological transformation” currently underway means companies need to be nimble and adaptable. “It’s important to be lean, it’s important to be flat, and it’s important to move fast,” he said. “That’s what we’re going to do.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: The job market may be sinking. Why you should beware of buyouts.
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/01/layoffs-buyouts-job-market-employment/86984517007/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:01:35Z
Full Content:
You’ve been offered a buyout. Your employer wants to pay you to quit. It’s a big chunk of change. But leaving your job now would mean searching for a new one in a weakening job market. Should you accept the offer? Companies offer buyouts to thin the ranks, spending money in the short term to save money in the long run. Employers often leverage buyouts to avoid layoffs in a shaky economy. And that thought, alone, should give you pause. The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. If you are mulling a buyout, some considerations are universal: How large is the severance package? Am I close to retirement? Did I want to leave that job anyway? But the current economic climate presents its own challenges. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal report. Unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since October 2021. Nearly 2 million Americans have been out of work for six months or longer, the Labor Department reported in May, the largest number in more than two years. Companies are doing less hiring out of uncertainty about President Trump’s tariffs. Artificial intelligence is swiping jobs from new graduates. Recession fears loom. “It is a very soft job market,” said Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, and a former Labor Department official in the Biden Administration, speaking to USA TODAY earlier this year. “It’s such a period of economic uncertainty, I think people are hanging onto their jobs.” Here are five tips for employees who are thinking about taking buyouts in 2025. Let’s start with a proactive step. Maybe your employer hasn’t offered a buyout. But you’re restless to make a change, and you’ve heard your company wants to cut costs. Consider approaching your managers and asking for a buyout. In many cases, there’s nothing to stop an employer from creating a voluntary severance package just for you. “You do see these things happen, particularly if there’s news that a company is planning on downsizing,” said Michael Scarpati, CEO of RetireUS, a financial wellness platform. “It’s kind of a win-win for both parties.” If you’re the first to ask for a buyout, you may get a better severance package than the one your employer eventually offers everyone else. But don’t ask for a buyout if you aren’t ready to take one. “You have to be willing to leave if they do offer it to you,” Walton said. “It’s not something you want to bluff about.” A typical buyout might offer four weeks of pay, plus another week for every year you’ve worked at the company. You might get extra health insurance coverage, even help in finding a new job. Roughly half of workers accept buyout offers without negotiating, AARP reports. But it can’t hurt to ask for better terms. “Think of it as if you’re going in for a job interview,” Scarpati said. You could ask for a full year of severance pay, rather than a few months. Perhaps your employer will cover the costs of health insurance while you look for a new job. Some workers hire attorneys to negotiate buyouts, said David John, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. That might sound extreme, but remember: A buyout is a business proposition. The contracts can be complicated, sometimes including non-disclosure agreements or non-compete clauses. Even if you don’t bring a lawyer to a buyout negotiation, Walton said, “you should at least meet with one.” Unless you’re planning to retire, experts say, you should gauge your chances of finding another job before you leave your current job. If you work in a shrinking field, or in an economically afflicted region, you may already know it. “It’s a pretty different thing to take a buyout in D.C. if you work in a thinktank, or to take a buyout if you work on an oil rig in South Dakota,” Evermore said. Look at Labor Department jobs reports, Evermore said, to find out how many people are applying for unemployment insurance in your area, and how many are lingering on the benefit rolls. Better still: Apply for some jobs. See if you get bites. If not, that might be a good sign a buyout isn’t for you. In the best-case scenario, you can line up a new job before you take the buyout. Many employers offer buyouts to avoid layoffs, or at least to delay them. If you have a buyout offer, weigh the odds that the company will resort to layoffs once the buyouts are past. “A responsible company will address those worries right off the bat, and say yes or no,” said John of AARP. If layoffs are likely, think about whether you might land on a layoff list. Ask your manager if you are vulnerable. If your company has endured layoffs in the past, look at the severance packages those workers received. In some cases, Walton said, a buyout package might be “the same thing your company offers you if it lays you off six months from now.” Many federal workers who took buyouts from the Trump administration had only weeks to decide. That’s not nearly long enough, experts say. “Asking someone to make a major life decision that may involve relocating your whole family, you should get at least a few months for that,” Evermore said. Ideally, Scarpati said, six weeks is a “minimum” timeframe for a buyout offer. Ninety days is more reasonable. Use that time to “think about where you’re at in your career,” Evermore said. Talk to friends, colleagues and loved ones about your options. Test the job market. Ask yourself if you’re ready to uproot your household and move across the country. And run the numbers. If you are mid-career, do you have enough emergency savings to survive a period of joblessness? How would you cover health insurance? How generous are the unemployment benefits in your state? If you are near retirement: When were you planning to take Social Security? How would you cover health insurance until Medicare kicks in? Do you have enough retirement savings? Consider meeting with a financial planner. “Ideally,” Walton said, “have this financial plan done before any of this happens.”

Title: AI Didn’t Layoff 14,000 People. Amazon Did.

ByAnn Kowal Smith, Contributor. Amazon cut 14,000 jobs this week, citing, in part, efficiency gains from AI. But blaming AI for layoffs is like blaming the thermometer for the fever. AI didn’t eliminate these jobs. Amazon did. Its leaders did. And they’re not alone. Across the tech giants, AI isn’t making these decisions—it’s masking them. Efficiency has become the new moral alibi—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and many others have all cited AI as justification for thousands of cuts. Every time leaders make a human decision and hide behind a technical one, they erode something far more valuable than headcount. They erode trust. The language of “AI gains” has become a convenient disguise for an old reflex: cut now, justify later. Leaders once blamed “the market.” They blamed Wall Street. Then automation. Today they blame AI. We’ve found the perfect scapegoat—one that never talks back. And efficiency becomes the virtue that absolves the decision. The further leaders move from the people affected by their decisions, the easier it becomes to treat humans as inputs rather than individuals. Data becomes a shield against empathy. AI doesn’t make these choices, but it makes it easier to hide from them. That’s the new face of moral outsourcing—not machines taking over judgment, but humans abdicating it. Here’s the irony: the productivity miracle AI promised hasn’t yet arrived. A recent MIT study found that despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment in generative AI, 95 percent of companies have seen no measurable return. Only five percent of pilots are delivering meaningful financial impact. If the payoff isn’t here, what exactly are we optimizing? The truth is, companies aren’t chasing performance, they’re shifting their bets. As GlobalData’s Neil Saunders observed, “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The story isn’t about productivity. It’s about where investment is flowing and what’s being left behind. Amazon’s own numbers tell the story clearly. The company isn’t shrinking because AI made it leaner. It’s shrinking to pay for AI. Net sales are up double digits year over year, and operating income topped $18 billion last quarter. Yet free cash flow has fallen from $53 billion to $18 billion in a year, driven largely by record spending on data centers, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure. Amazon is cutting costs today to fund the AI infrastructure that might, someday, deliver results tomorrow. Efficiency, pursued for its own sake, stops serving people and starts consuming them. From Microsoft to Meta, Google to Dell, the same logic echoes: cut people now to finance the systems to eventually replace them. The question isn’t whether AI will make us more productive. It’s what we’ll have sacrificed by the time it does. Each algorithmic layoff widens the distance between leaders and the people they lead. It doesn’t just trim headcount. It thins the thread of trust that holds organizations together. The stock market is booming. Yet, in the U.S. alone, nearly 700,000 job cuts were announced in the first half of 2025, up 80% over the same period last year. Every time an organization maximizes profits and machines over people, the social contract that binds workplaces together is collateral damage. It used to be that if you were smart, worked hard, and loyal to your company, they were loyal to you. Those days are disappearing. Now we ask laid off workers to pay the price for oversized payrolls, while the leaders move forward unaffected. It’s unrealistic to suggest that a company can never downsize, that it can’t restructure itself to meet the needs of a disruptive technology. But when people are involved, the “how” matters. When an automotive supplier found itself in a similar pickle, needing to reduce its workforce by 30% to stay afloat, its leaders charted a different path. Instead of mass layoffs, they offered voluntary retirement plans, each with generous severance, and met their reduction needs organically. Preserving everyone’s dignity, those who left and those who stayed remained deeply committed to the company and its success. You can’t innovate in a climate of fear. And more than half of workers now fear losing their jobs in the next year. People stop taking risks. They comply. They play it safe. Ironically, at the dawn of the AI era, we’re engineering the conditions least conducive to innovation. At its highest and best use, AI could help us cure cancer, rebuild infrastructure, even reverse climate damage. But we may throw that future away. Not because machines failed us, but because we did. It doesn’t have to be this way. AI isn’t inherently dehumanizing. It’s a mirror, reflecting the values of those who build and wield it. LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman envisions a new “relationship economy,” one where social intelligence sits at the center of work. “Human ideas are the new code,” he says. “Human energy is the new data center. And a new world of work anchored on the human brain is about to emerge.” It’s an inspiring vision—one we could realize, or ruin—depending on how we use the power in our hands. Octavia Butler captured this paradox decades ago in her evocative short story, The Book of Martha, where God asks a woman to redesign humanity to save the world. Every solution she imagines creates a new harm. The story ends not with certainty, but humility. That’s the leadership lesson AI demands: every “efficiency” we celebrate carries consequences we can’t yet see. Every act of progress leaves a shadow, and real wisdom lies in seeing both. As AI moves closer to the center of decision-making, leadership’s job is to keep accountability in human hands. The future of work won’t be written by bots. It will be written in the daily decisions leaders make about people. Taking responsibility begins with owning those choices. Leaders should state plainly what was decided, why it was decided, and who is accountable. Transparency is the first antidote to moral outsourcing. It also requires re-humanizing the data. Every data point represents a person, a livelihood, a story. Before optimizing, leaders should ask who is affected, what relationships might be broken, and what trust might be lost. Data without dialogue degrades judgment. And finally, responsibility means measuring what truly matters. Not just productivity or profit, but belonging, learning, and creativity—the conditions that make innovation possible. In an age obsessed with speed, these are the slow variables that determine whether progress endures. If we want AI to serve humanity, we must first take responsibility for the humans we lead. Committed employees need a committed employer. It’s a social contract grounded in mutual trust. Amazon’s layoffs aren’t just another round of cost-cutting—they’re a warning to every company chasing the same playbook. When the world’s most powerful firms reduce people simply to expand their AI budgets, they send a clear signal about the future of work: speed over stewardship, profits over people, efficiency over empathy. The short-term gain is easy to count; the long-term cost isn’t. It won’t appear on a balance sheet. It will surface later, in the trust we squander, the talent we silence, and the future we forfeit. The danger isn’t artificial intelligence. It’s artificial leadership.

Title: Amazon cutting 760 corporate jobs in Southern California

Amazon, which announced plans this week to reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 jobs, says it is laying off 760 jobs in Southern California beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence. Overall, Amazon says it will cut 1,540 positions in California — including 783 in Northern California, according to Vani Appukkutty, a senior manager in the company’s human resources department. In Southern California, layoffs are coming to Irvine (333), Culver City (152), San Diego (145) and Santa Monica (130). Also see: Disneyland lays off about 100 salaried employees The layoffs begin Jan. 26 and finish by April 1, Appukkutty wrote in Oct. 28 letters filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. “Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent,” she wrote. The filings were made as part of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act — commonly referred to as WARN — which are required when an employer lays off more than 50 employees. All affected employees are notified at least 60 days before their terminations are scheduled to occur, according to Appukkutty. The layoffs include positions for business intelligence, data, software and security engineers, contract managers, creative marketers, financial analysts, game artists and designers, lawyers, product managers, tax analysts and other administrative staff, according to the EDD letters. More job cuts: Santa Monica-based RAND cuts 11% of its workforce Appukkutty did not provide reasons for the layoffs or where in the tech giant the reductions would happen. However, news reports said that Amazon.com was gutting its video-game division in Irvine, San Diego and its central publishing division. The retailer also announced Oct. 3 that it would close four of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in Southern California by mid-November as it reevaluates store performance. Beth Galetti, senior vice president in charge of Amazon’s human resources department, wrote in an Oct. 28 blog post that artificial intelligence is enabling companies to “innovate much faster than ever before.” In announcing the 14,000 corporate layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon is convinced of the “need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said that the reductions are a continuation of the work to get even “stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources” to invest in Amazon’s future. The corporate layoffs mean “reducing in some areas and hiring in others,” she added. For instance, Amazon announced in early October that it planned to fill 30,000 new seasonal roles across California, including up to 8,000 roles in Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario — as well as up to 3,000 roles for the upcoming holidays across Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim, and 1,300 roles in San Diego, Chula Vista and Carlsbad. Many of the seasonal roles have the potential to transition into year-round employment with benefits, said Amazon spokeswoman Carly Levy in an Oct. 14 statement.Related Articles 2 Amazon Fresh grocery stores are closing in Orange County

Title: Is the job market frozen or faltering?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Layoffs raise alarms while young workers eye law school They call it the Great Freeze. That’s how some analysts describe the U.S. job market recently — a “low-hire, low-fire” environment where workers who have jobs are not losing them but finding a new job is difficult. But a thaw may be coming. A “slew” of “large-scale layoffs” may be a sign that the labor market is “starting to tip over,” said Axios. Amazon announced it will slash 14,000 jobs, UPS said it was cutting 48,000 positions, and Paramount said it was laying off 1,000 workers. The unemployment rate had hovered around 4% for more than a year, but that “apparent stability” has concealed “change beneath the surface.” Now, companies appear ready to “take advantage of the potential of AI to transform work.” This could mean fewer jobs for humans. The massive layoffs suggest the job market’s “current state of suspension has changed for the worse,” said MarketWatch. While companies are still comfortably profitable, they are waiting on the “dust to settle” from tariff negotiations, the government shutdown and the corporate adoption of AI. Amazon’s layoffs could be the tipping point. “We may see others join the fray,” said John Challenger, the CEO of career-services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The job market “could get ugly,” Dan DeFrancesco said at Business Insider. “About 20 more Amazon-sized layoffs” would upend the labor market. That scenario is “not out of the realm of possibility” because “companies are known to follow the lead of their bigger peers.” Meta’s 2022 layoff of 11,000 workers led to a much larger wave of tech sector job cuts. American companies have recently been in a “holding pattern,” but if they start to let workers go without replacing them, the “somewhat resilient job market could start to show some real cracks.” “The labor market is undeniably going through a transition,” Adam Hardy said at Money. Young workers are “canaries in the coal mine” since they are often the first to feel job market instability, and “young workers and recent college grads aren’t doing so well” at the moment. AI is often blamed, but there are other factors. Right now, there are “more graduates than there are jobs that require grads.” That’s a challenge that predates the rise of AI by “several years.” The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point this week to “shore up the softening job market,” said NPR. On top of private sector layoffs, the federal government has already cut about 100,000 jobs this year. American employment “may well be shrinking already,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier in October. Bad news for the job market might be good news for graduate programs. “Applications are on the rise” at law schools and MBA programs, said Fortune, with law school applications up 3% over last year. Gen-Z job seekers are buying “more time to figure out what’s next” instead of “facing the bleak job market head-on.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Joel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

Title: Amazon says it didn't cut people because of money. But because of 'culture'

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy’s explanation for why the company is cutting 14,000 employees? Not money. Not even AI, but “culture.” The layoff announcement ﻿this week was “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now. It’s culture,” Jassy said in response to an analyst question on the company’s earnings call Thursday. Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion. Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.” Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings. “It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.” Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers.

Title: Amazon VP says his division is hiring and promoting based on employees' AI usage

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Want to get ahead in Amazon's home security unit? You'd better be using AI. In July, Business Insider viewed an email from Jamie Siminoff, Amazon's VP of product who runs the home security division. In it, Siminoff said that all promotion applications would require employees to list how they were using AI. Siminoff doubled down on that position in an interview with Business Insider last week while promoting his book "Ding Dong." "I would go even deeper than that," Siminoff said. "We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job." Siminoff said that he wants to incentivize his team to use the technology more. "The promotion process is the only real incentive that I can give to a team, because that's how they're going to get paid," he said. "If you are creating more leverage for the company than everyone else, then yeah, that should be how you get promoted." Siminoff spoke with Business Insider before Amazon cut 14,000 jobs on Tuesday. On a recent earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were "not really financially driven," nor were they "really AI-driven, not right now at least," but they were rather about "culture." Siminoff declined to provide an additional comment after the layoffs. At the time of Business Insider's July reporting on Jassy's memo, an Amazon representative said that the change to promotional applications did not apply to the whole company, only to those in the RBKS division — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk. Siminoff cofounded Ring, the video doorbell and home security company. He pitched the "Shark Tank" investors in 2013 but walked away without a deal. Five years later, the company was acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion. After leaving Amazon in 2023, Siminoff returned in his new role as VP of product in April 2025. He refocused Ring on crime-fighting and home security, and added more AI features to the product lineup. In his interview with Business Insider, Siminoff also said that he was asking about AI usage during hiring interviews: "AI in, AI out. It is like a broken record." Asked what an AI-related interview question might sound like, Siminoff said it differed between roles. For example, an engineer might be asked which tools they know how to use, he said. "I think it's the mentality of: are you leaning into AI first?" Siminoff said. "We don't want someone who's like, 'Oh, AI, I know how to use that, I'll use it if you tell me to.'" The ideal candidate already uses tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to solve daily problems, he added. "You're thinking that way natively," Siminoff said. "That's the people I want now." Jump to

UPDATE: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is revising the company's explanation for its mass layoffs this week, which could be frustrating for the 14,000 people who lost their jobs. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven—not right now, at least," Jassy said on a Thursday earnings call. "It’s culture." Jassy says Amazon's growth in the past few years left it with too many people, locations, and types of businesses. He reiterated the company's desire to operate like "the world's largest startup, [which] means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly." That partially conflicts with the memo Amazon published on the day it announced layoffs. Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, also mentioned being the "world's largest startup" and stressed the "importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership." However, Galetti also specifically called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote. "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." Amazon stock is surging today, up 12% after it reported stellar Q3 earnings, beating expectations, CNBC reports. Original Story 10/28:Amazon today confirmed plans to lay off 14,000 people in corporate roles amid a continued push on AI, though more cuts could be in store for 2026. The company is "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets," Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, wrote in a company-wide email that it also published online. Galetti's memo comes after Reuters reported yesterday that Amazon planned to cut "as many as 30,000 corporate jobs." She didn't address that number, but said Amazon expects to find "additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains" next year. Reuters reports the cuts will primarily affect those in HR, devices, services, and operations. Employees will hear today if they are affected. Amazon will offer "most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Those who cannot find a new role at Amazon will receive "transition support, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more," Galetti says. Some are already posting about being laid off on social media. "After years of pouring my heart into this company and its people, it’s surreal to say that this chapter is now closed," a senior recruiter with Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios wrote on LinkedIn. Usually this type of corporate cut would occur when a company is doing poorly, but Amazon had $18 billion in profit in the latest quarter, The New York Times reports. It's also increased spending on AI data centers. Amazon acknowledged this in its employee memo, citing its ambitions to move even faster in AI. "Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well," Galetti wrote. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)." Amazon plans to "operate like the world's largest startup," she added, a phrase CEO Andy Jassy first used in a September 2024 memo to employees in which he also announced a "bureaucracy mailbox," where employees could forward examples of "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out." Amazon also laid off approximately 27,000 people a few years ago. As of July, it had 1.55 million employees. Last week, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division, also citing the need to move faster, so even those who work in AI might not be safe in today's unpredictable tech climate. Last week, The New York Times reported that Amazon would ramp up the use of automation in its warehouses in the coming years, which would allow it to hire about 600,000 fewer human employees. Amazon pushed back on that characterization, however, and pointed to the 250,000 seasonal jobs it will once again add for the holiday rush.

Title: Amazon shares soar 11% on strong cloud growth, easing investor fears over AI spending

Shares in Amazon soared about 11% to reach a new record high Friday after the firm reported its strongest cloud growth since 2022 – easing investor fears that industry giants have been overspending on AI. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had soared 1.2% Friday morning as of about 10:50 a.m. ET, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Averaged jumped 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. On Thursday, investors sent shares in Meta and Microsoft sliding about 12% and 3%, respectively, after both companies announced plans to hike capital expenditures on AI. Major stock indexes are still set to the end the week higher. The Dow and Nasdaq are on track for their longest streaks of monthly gains since January 2018. Amazon on Thursday revealed it had notched its fastest cloud-computing growth since 2022 and announced plans to raise its data-center capacity. Revenue in its cloud unit jumped 20.2% in the most recent quarter – beating Wall Street estimates of 18.1%. The company is currently the leading provider of cloud infrastructure tech. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months,” CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday. It reported earnings per share of $1.95, above estimates of $1.57, and revenue of $180.17 billion, beating expectations of $177.8 billion. For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects to bring in sales of $206 billion to $213 billion, above what analysts were expecting. It also expects operating income of between $21 billion and $26 billion, compared to estimates of $23.8 billion. Like other tech giants this week, Amazon hiked its planned capital expenditures for this year. It now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025 – up from $118 billion. The company plans to spend even more next year. Just this week, the firm launched Project Rainier, an $11 billion data center in rural Indiana. But Amazon has been focused on cutting costs in other areas, launching a round of 14,000 job cuts this week. In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office workforce – over the coming weeks. During an earnings call Thursday, Jassy said the layoffs were not “financially driven,” but rather a “culture” move as the firm aims to cut down on bureaucracy. Apple on Thursday also reported upbeat quarterly earnings and a strong forecast for December. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

While the shares initially jumped Friday morning, they later fell about 0.3% since its sales and revenue in China — one of the company’s largest markets — missed expectations. However, it reported earnings per share of $1.85, above estimates of $1.77, and revenue of $102.47 billion, beating expectations of $102.24 billion. The company expects revenue to soar 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter – well above Wall Street estimates of 6%, said Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh. A “double-digit” increase in iPhone sales from the previous year is expected to lead the revenue beat, he added. That’s thanks to an “off the chart” global response to Apple’s new iPhone 17 lineup, CEO Tim Cook said, adding that store traffic is up significantly on a yearly basis. In the most recent quarter, Apple reported $27.46 billion in net income, up from $14.29 billion in the same period last year. A one-time tax charge pushed last year’s figure lower. For fiscal year 2025, Apple reported $416 billion in total revenue – up 6% from the previous year. Sales in the most recent quarter jumped 8% from the same time last year. Total iPhone revenue jumped 6% to $49.03 billion. The new iPhone 17 models went on sale on Sept. 19, so only about a week of these sales were included in the quarterly earnings report. Analysts had expected $50.19 billion in iPhone sales. Cook said the miss was because several models were affected by supply constraints. The company’s iPad business came in flat, with $6.95 billion in sales. Services – which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions, App Store charges and warranties for hardware – rose 15% to $24.97 billion in sales. Its “Other Products” category, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Vision Pro, dipped slightly to $9.04 billion in sales. Its Mac business also jumped 13% to $8.72 billion in sales. Cook said the company had not hiked prices due to tariffs. Instead, Apple is “just absorbing the tariffs in gross margin.” A gross margin of 47.2% beat estimates of 46.4%. Advertisement

Title: AI will accelerate the end of brick and mortar’s reign: Amazon CEO

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The domination of e-commerce is inevitable and will only come faster thanks to the emerging technology, even if physical stores represent opportunity for now, Andy Jassy told analysts Thursday. Amazon sees “a significant opportunity” for growth in its existing physical stores, which are centered on grocery — at least for now. The e-commerce giant announced plans to expand same-day deliveries of fresh groceries, now in 1,000 U.S. cities, to 2,300 by the end of the year. Even that could be seen as an extension of e-commerce as much of physical retail. In any case, despite the current dominance of brick and mortar, e-commerce will ultimately take over, and AI is making that happen even faster than before, Andy Jassy told analysts on a Thursday earnings call. “I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores,” he said. “That equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that.” Physical retail remains a small, if growing, portion of Amazon’s retail operation. In Q3 online store sales rose 10% year over year to $67.4 billion, while physical stores sales rose 7% to $5.6 billion, according to financial filings Thursday. Overall product sales rose 9.6% to $74.1 billion. There’s a price to all of that e-commerce, as worldwide shipping costs rose 8% to $25.4 billion. Several analysts noted that Amazon is taking share in retail. But other aspects of the retail business are growing faster than either the online or offline channel. Seller services sales grew 12% to $42.5 billion; advertising grew 24% to $17.7 billion; and subscription services grew 11% to $12.6 billion. Whatever the impact of AI on the retail landscape, there’s no doubt it’s fueling Amazon’s tech operation, and Amazon’s tech operation is fueling profits. Most analyst reports released Thursday and Friday focused on the company’s AWS unit, where Q3 net sales rose 20% year on year to over $33 billion. Even with estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs, AWS segment operating income rose over 9% to $11.4 billion. Overall operating income, including two special charges — $2.5 billion from a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs — was essentially flat from last year at $17.4 billion. “Clearly AWS continues to drive the bus here, with acceleration in growth and better-than-expected operating margin in the segment,” William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden said in a Friday client note. The 14,000 layoffs confirmed by Amazon earlier in the week are also tied to AI, as the company said it anticipates a need for fewer people as generative AI continues to advance.

Title: Slog AM: Seattle's Soggy Halloween, Prince Andrew Is a Prince No More, Trump Demands That GOP Kill Filibuster

Happy Halloween, you little ghouls: I have compiled an especially spooky, scary morning news for you. Except, not really. These are just the regular headlines. Because every day is hell. The Scariest Thing This Halloween: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the recent 14,000-person tech layoffs (2,303 of which hit Seattle Amazonians). He said the reason wasn't financial nor was it about AI. Instead, it was culture. He said the company grew fast, hired faster, and now had too many "layers." This is not the way to operate, apparently. With so many people the company can't "be flat and... move fast." The culture Jassy speaks of is this: Amazon is not in the business of people, but of course, in the business of profit. Too many people bogs down the profit. This year, Amazon reported $180.2 billion and Amazon Web Services reported $33 billion in sales. It is never enough. After the layoffs, Amazon's stock ticked up 14%. Watch Out, This Could Be You: Man Wouldn't Have Worn Costume To Work If He'd Known He Was Getting Laid Off [image or embed] Another Halloween Fright: Traffic will be bad for those of you stuck in your little cars. Take a bus or a train to your Halloween party. The I-5 Ship Canal Bridge construction will continue this weekend in the southbound lanes. Rain won't stop that mess. Rain could stop the planned construction on I-405. If it doesn't, then prepare for multiple northbound lane closures between Northeast 124th Street and Northeast 160th Street. Annnnnd all westbound lanes on I-90 from Mercer Island to Seattle are closing Friday night through early Saturday morning. The real horror: Halloween is the day the most child pedestrian deaths happen in the US. Don't drive your stupid car tonight in the stupid rain and hit any stupid kids. I'm warning you! Happy Halloween!!! Reminder that Halloween is the most dangerous day of the year for pedestrians, so: 1. Don’t drive2. If you must drive, slow down!3. Longer term, advocate for more walkability where you live[image or embed] Something Wicked This Way Comes: Trick or Treaters beware. An atmospheric river-like weather system will unleash a soggy hell on this evening's festivities and the weekend that follows. It'll be gushers only in your candy pail. Cause of the rain. Darkness Falls: The clocks roll back starting Sunday morning at 2 a.m. Winter is readying its cold, spindly fingers around our necks. After this weekend, sunset will fall at a dastardly 4:49 p.m. In Skeleton News: Flava Flav has been anointed the official hype man for the US bobsled and skeleton teams in the 2026 Winter Olympics. In case you, like me, forgot there are Olympics next year, there are and they will be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Stripping Prince Andrew: No! No! Not like that. Well, a little like that? Britain's King Charles has started the process of severing his brother's ties with the monarchy. The now-almost-ex prince has been mired in controversy over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal of being friends with a serial sex pest creep reached new heights recently after Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir alleged Andrew assaulted her when she was a teen. Andrew denied these allegations. Not enough! No princely titles and no more lodging at royal estates for you, buddy. Trump Calls for the End of the Filibuster: President Donald Trump would like the shutdown to end. Not through compromise, of course. On Truth Social, Trump screamed, "INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER." Overcoming a filibuster in the full Senate requires 60 votes. The Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. To abolish the filibuster as a whole would change how the Senate does debate. Democrats continue to block the measure that would fund the government because they're fighting for the reinstatement of healthcare subsidies so Americans don't suffer even more exorbitant insurance costs. Trump called getting rid of the filibuster the Senate GOP's "TRUMP CARD." The GOP fears eliminating the filibuster could hurt them if the Democrats ever regain control of Congress. Whatever happens, it'll be too late to save SNAP benefits before they run dry on Nov. 1. The government shutdown has lasted 31 days. It will at least last a few more. Senators left D.C. without making any deals. Millions of people will have to deal with their SNAP benefits lapsing tomorrow. However, there is a shred of hope. A federal judge from Massachusetts will decide Friday whether the Trump administration must continue to fund food stamps during the shutdown. Justice? Some Senators couldn't get home last night after their long day of not re-opening the government. Why? Shutdown-induced delays at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Melissa Kills 49: Hurricane Melissa killed 30 people in Haiti, and 20 people are still missing. In Jamaica, Melissa's death toll reached 19. The now-Category 2 storm steered mostly clear of Bermuda, which experienced her wrath as a strong tropical storm. Illinois Advocates Sue Feds: Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center have sued Immigrations and Custom Enforcement for its treatment of detainees. According to the suit, ICE officials have blocked detainees from contacting lawyers, deprived them of food and medical treatment, and forced them to sign papers relinquishing their rights.

We Have the Louvre Heist at Home: Thieves nabbed more than 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California's off-site storage facility. They stole metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets, scrimshaw walrus tusks, and 20th century sports memorabilia. We are in a heist heyday! A Long Read: Rich liberal family hires part-time live-in nanny for their child at their upstate New York home. The nanny gets kind of weird, then refuses to leave. I hate when this happens! A Kentucky woman opened a package expecting the medicine she had ordered. Instead, she found "arms and fingers." The county coroner said there had been a mishap with "an airline company, a freight company, and a courier." The coroner picked up the arms and fingers from the woman and intended to return them to the courier so the arms and fingers can go to their intended recipient. It is unclear who ordered the arms and fingers and for what purpose. Likely, not for medicine. Viva la France: A 77-year-old French cyclist fell 130 feet into a ravine and survived for three days thanks to the bottles of red wine he was toting in his grocery bags. A Song for Your Halloween: It is really the only song to listen to today. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger. She likes covering anything she finds fun, weird, or interesting. You can find a lot of that in her column, Play Date. She hates dentists and loves costume parties.

It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From retail’s onslaught of layoffs to how much Walmart captured from SNAP grocery spending last year, here’s our closeout for the week. Lululemon throws a Hail Mary As it navigates a rare tough patch, Lululemon is hoping a partnership with the NFL can inject some momentum into the business. The athleisure giant on Monday announced it would release an “elevated apparel collection” surrounding the NFL’s 32 teams. The product line, released Tuesday, pulls from Lululemon’s Steady State, Define, Scuba and Align styles and crosses both men’s and women’s. The assortment features both apparel and accessories. Products will be available at the NFL Shop website, Fanatics and team retail locations, including stadium stores. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, said the retailer was “thrilled” to be a part of the weekly NFL ritual. “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel, it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family,” Burgoyne said. Analysts aren’t as rosy on the partnership. Jefferies analysts this week called the decision “another questionable move that doesn't make sense” and said it hinted at “deeper strategic confusion.” The move mirrors others aimed at attracting young shoppers, Jefferies wrote, but that risks alienating its core female shopper. “It remains unclear how selling NFL apparel fits into [Lululemon’s] long-term vision,” Jefferies analysts said. “Is this a one-off licensing play, or a signal of a permanent shift toward mass-market, logo-driven product? There is little evidence that these moves will drive durable, profitable growth.” Gen Z-focused intimates brand Parade shuts down DTC intimates brand Parade has shut down after six years, the company announced in an email to customers over the weekend. “Parade was created with the intention to welcome you all to express yourself in full-spectrum color with confidence, and we hope we were able to create that space for you,” the email read. The brand was founded by Cami Téllez and launched in 2019. In 2023, Parade was acquired by Ariela & Associates International. Over the years, the brand expanded beyond its intimates roots, launching into swimwear and activewear. In its message this week, Parade directed customers to Ariela’s other brands, including Curvy Couture and Smart&Sexy. Bacon the holidays better It might be Halloween, but companies already have their sites set on other celebrations. Dunkin' will start selling its holiday season lineup on Wednesday. This year features a Cookie Butter Cloud Latte and a Berry Sangria Refresher, along with returning favorites Peppermint Mocha and Toasted White Chocolate Signature Lattes. Food offerings include a new Raspberry Striped Croissant and two bacon jam options — the Ultimate Bacon Jam Breakfast Sandwich and Bacon Jam Grilled Cheese. The company is also offering limited-edition packaging designs. “After seeing fans make their own Cookie Butter hacks, we knew it was time to make it official with the Cookie Butter Cloud Latte,” Anthony Epter, vice president of menu innovation at Dunkin’, said in a statement. “And because we know how busy the season can be, we created our Bacon Jam lineup to give guests something satisfying and easy to enjoy on the go.” 26% That’s the percentage Walmart captured in SNAP grocery spend over the past year, according to a Numerator report. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food benefits to low-income families to support their grocery budgets, will not be issued to tens of millions of Americans on Saturday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. SNAP shoppers spend an average of $2,653 annually at Walmart, per the report. A whirlwind of layoffs The past week or so has brought a downpour of layoffs. Amazon is reducing its corporate workforce by around 14,000 with some outlets reporting more layoffs to come, while Puma will eliminate around 900 corporate jobs (adding to the 500 roles it cut earlier this year). Children’s clothing store Carter’s will lay off 300, Target cut 1,800 jobs and UPS has eliminated about 34,000 positions so far this year.

Title: How some of the world's biggest tech companies stacked up during earnings season

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Happy Halloween! Keep an eye out for AI-inspired costumes tonight. (Just good luck trying to automate trick-or-treating!) In case you missed it, I had a fantastic discussion with Eugene Kim and Aki Ito yesterday about the Amazon layoffs and its wider impact across corporate America. Luckily, you can watch a replay of the whole discussion here. In today's big story, tech earnings have finally wrapped. Here's what you need to know. What's on deck: Markets: The former McKinsey executive who is Zohran Mamdani's bridge to NYC's C-suite. Tech: Who got rich from Navan's IPO? Business: The era of the never-ending layoff might be here. But first, give me the CliffNotes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. If you blinked, you might have missed it. Earnings season hit Big Tech, and there's a lot to unpack. (And a lot of AI spending going on.) Five of the world's most important companies provided updates on their businesses over the course of two days. To quickly catch you up on how things shook out, here's a rundown on the main takeaways from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. But first, a quick plug for my colleague Alistair Barr's newsletter. Tech Memo is a must-subscribe if you even have a slight interest in the industry, so do yourself a favor and click here. Ok, let's dive in. Alphabet: Hot on ChatGPT's heels. Look out, OpenAI. Here comes Gemini. Google's chatbot now has 650 million monthly active users. That's about a 44% jump from just a few months ago. Sure, it still trails the behemoth that is ChatGPT, which has a staggering 800 million weekly active users. But the growth shows Gemini is building momentum, and especially with the youths. Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app, told BI's Hugh Langley there has been a big demographic shift to younger users. That's thanks to its viral image editor Nano Banana. Microsoft: Spend, spend, spend. Spending big on AI infrastructure was already a massive theme in tech heading into earnings, and Microsoft certainly didn't stray from the path. An internal memo from CFO Amy Hood seen by BI's Ashley Stewart highlighted the company's record $34.9 billion infrastructure spending to meet AI demand this quarter. Investors aren't necessarily buying it, as concerns are growing about whether all this money will lead to some ROI. Meta: Oh, you think that's a lot of tech spending? Hold my beer. Meta has never shied away from its intent to spend big on AI. That proved true this week when it bumped its estimate for infrastructure spend this year to between $70 billion and $72 billion. The number raised plenty of questions for Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps his answers didn't land quite the right way. Meta's stock tumbled more than 11% on Thursday. Meta's commitment to AI is clear, but loyalty to a trend is a fickle thing at the tech giant. Remember the good old metaverse? It got zero mentions from Meta executives on Wednesday's call. Apple: Big trouble in China. The iPhone maker delivered an earnings beat, with revenue growing 8% year over year. However, things weren't so bright in China, an important market for Apple. Revenue was actually down compared to a year ago, and it's not like 2024 was a banner year for Apple in the country either. Amazon: Layoffs? What layoffs? Only a few days removed from cutting 14,000 corporate employees, Amazon reported some big wins in earnings. There was huge growth, particularly when it came to its somewhat beleaguered cloud unit. As for those layoffs, CEO Andy Jassy offered some clarity about the motivation. According to Jassy, it wasn't about AI or even cost savings. It was because they didn't fit the culture, he said. 1. Meet Zohran Mamdani's CEO whisperer. Former McKinsey executive and Ayn Rand fan Yasser Salem has become the democratic socialist candidate's bridge to New York's C-suite. Salem hopes to turn skeptics into partners and told BI that he has met with over 70 CEOs to discuss their concerns. 2. Hedge funds are on track for a banner year. Despite an array of macroeconomic headwinds, the industry is set to have its best annual showing since the pandemic, according to fund administrator Citco. Multistrategy funds are leading the way, with an average return of 19.3%. 3. JPMorgan wants everyone in its 300,000 workforce to become AI pros. America's biggest bank is rolling out a firmwide AI training push, but it'll affect different workers in different ways, chief analytics officer Derek Waldron said in an interview with McKinsey. The multi-pronged strategy is helping people get comfortable, he said. 1. Navan finally makes its (public) debut. The travel and expense management company has become the largest to test the IPO waters during a government shutdown. BI calculated the numbers — and these are the big VC winners. 2. Use AI, but don't depend on it. Many bosses are encouraging workers to lean in on AI, but some are also worried workers could forget how to do their jobs without it. 3. AI is starting to take a bite out of Wikipedia's traffic. Wiki reported its traffic is down 8% in the last few months when compared to the same time last year, and AI summaries and chatbots that aggregate its data are largely to blame. BI's Katie Notopoulos explores whether Wikipedia is in trouble or not. 1. The world's most important economic relationship just got a reset. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping emerged from their first IRL meeting in six years with warmth and progress. Beneath the diplomatic niceties, three major business takeaways stood out. 2. The rise of the rolling layoff. Companies like Amazon and Paramount Skydance have conducted multiple rounds of layoffs recently, leaving some employees relieved that they held onto their jobs but fearing they might be next. That can be pretty bad for morale and productivity. Here's why companies do it anyway. 3. Slop bowl stocks slump. Chipotle's stock fell 18% missing consensus Q3 revenue estimates. The fast-food chain revealed a significant decline in customer traffic among Gen Z and millennials, which prompted a reduced outlook. Competitors Sweetgreen and Cava also saw their stocks fall.

Title: Another tech giant’s gaming ambitions bite the dust | Opinion
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/another-tech-giants-gaming-ambitions-bite-the-dust-opinion
Time Published: 2025-10-31T14:15:30Z

The gutting of Amazon Games is tragic, but arguably a long time coming; like many tech giants, the company critically underestimated the complexity of succeeding in this market The gutting of Amazon's gaming division as part of a sweeping round of job cuts across the company is another blow to the already grim state of the games industry's employment market and career stability. It's not clear how many of the 14,000 jobs the giant company is cutting will be in its gaming subsidiaries, but it's flagged "significant role reductions" and a major turn away from developing big-budget titles. As awful as the impact of any major layoffs may be, this one has been a long time coming. By that I mean no disrespect to the no doubt hard-working and talented people whose lives are being dealt hammer blows by these strategic decisions made far above their pay grades; Amazon’s studios' games featured a lot of genuinely great work, perhaps most notably on New World, an MMORPG title that’s now among those now slated for shutdown. Strategically, however, Amazon's entire flirtation with the notion of being a games company has been a decades-long comedy of errors. The world's largest and most powerful retailer and Cloud services operator has at every turn failed to leverage its market advantages or produce a coherent strategy that lasted for more than about five minutes. It's a testament to the incredible strength and growth of Amazon overall – driven first by its online retail business and more recently by Amazon Web Services – that the directionless bungling of its games-related efforts has survived so many restructures, U-turns, product cancellations, and leadership changes. However much was being spent on games, it could be waved away as a rounding error during the boom years – but the music was bound to stop sooner or later. With Amazon now battening down the hatches across the board, gaming's blessed existence as a muddled, loss-making hobby for the company has seemingly come to an end. What's extraordinary in all this is just how little Amazon has to show for all the time and effort it has expended on gaming. The company is of course one of the biggest gaming retailers in the world simply by virtue of being Amazon, but has failed to leverage that into any meaningful position in digital gaming. So poor has the company's performance on that front been that when a LinkedIn post from former Prime Gaming VP Ethan Evans surfaced in February, reflecting on the company's failure to disrupt Steam's dominance of the PC digital distribution market. The most common reaction was genuine surprise at the discovery that Amazon had actually been trying to compete with Steam in the first place. Everything Amazon did in this space was just so fragmented and temporary. Prime Gaming actually included a bunch of free games for Prime subscribers, but it's not clear how many subscribers even knew that – and the games you redeemed there were generally provided through third-party stores like GoG or Epic Games Store, not added to any kind of Amazon Games library. That service fluctuated between trying to be an actual games subscription service and instead being an offering of free currency packs for popular F2P games; now it's been folded into the Luna game streaming service, though the average Amazon customer would be hard pressed to notice that either service exists, let alone that they’ve merged. The contrast with how Amazon has approached Prime Video – a service that it seemingly genuinely believes in, with support right up to the top of the company, even when it's flinging ill-advised billions at Lord of the Rings shows nobody asked for – is instructive. When you search for a movie on Amazon, Prime Video results are front and centre; if you want to buy an actual DVD or Blu-Ray, you'll have to click your way through several screens letting you know that it’s available to watch for free, to rent, or to buy on the streaming service. Search for a game on Amazon, though, and you often wouldn’t get anything of the sort; at times it was quite possible to buy a game that was already available to you for free on Prime Gaming or Luna without ever once seeing information to that effect. For all the strategic errors that were undoubtedly made on the development and publishing side of Amazon Gaming, I don't think the company can really be faulted for failing to become the major publisher they wished to be. That's an exceptionally difficult thing to do and is well outside Amazon's core competencies (to wit, running a cloud platform, and dabbling in a little light retail on the side). The fact that some games – like New World – actually did turn out well and create a passionate, if not huge, fanbase is not a bad showing on that front, albeit apparently not a commercially viable business unit either. The total failure to leverage the company's scale and its dominance of cloud and consumer-facing retail into any kind of foothold in digital distribution or online gaming services, however, is almost impressive; especially when you consider that the company apparently thought it was mounting serious competition to Steam for all this time. As much as there were individual managers and executives responsible for the decision making at Amazon, and some of them made really bad choices along the way, I think it's more instructive to think about what happened here in terms of structural failure. After all, Amazon isn't alone in this failure. It's only a few years since we saw Google abruptly (if entirely predictably) throw its hands in the air and give up on its own once-grand gaming ambitions, with the Stadia streaming service being ditched and full refunds being issued for hardware and games for the platform. That's two of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" who have essentially burned their hands on the gaming stove in the past five years alone. Scale, finances, and tech dominance simply aren't enough to make it in what is, essentially, a creative industry that sometimes cosplays as a tech sector on weekends. Google wasn't willing to make the long-term commitment required to build a business in this sector, while Amazon seemingly lacked the coherent vision and high-level support required to leverage its actual competitive advantages on behalf of its gaming ambitions. At their core, though, I'd argue that both failures boil down to the same root cause. The cultures of both companies were simply ill-suited to the kind of management style that's needed to nursemaid complex, long-term, expensive creative projects to a successful fruition. The kind of intensive internal competition that has been a catalyst for success for many tech companies is disastrous for creative industries, where constructive collaboration always yields far better results in the long-term than Darwinian competition. With tens upon tens of billions of dollars currently floating around the games industry for gigantic acquisitions and mergers, the collapse of Amazon's gaming ambitions may be a very timely reminder that there are some things money can't buy – especially in the absence of a coherent strategy to spend it.

Title: North Road Restructures International As President Jan Frouman Exits Amid Layoffs In London

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Change is once again afoot at Peter Chernin’s North Road Company with international President Jan Frouman exiting after three years as part of a restructure in London. Frouman, who left last month, is one of a number who has exited North Road’s London base, we understand. Several more junior staff were laid off. Frouman will not be replaced like-for-like and his place leading North Road’s international scripted efforts will be taken by L.A.-based North Road President Scott Manson along with the North Road scripted teams and Chernin Entertainment. The UK hub of North Road label Kinetic Content, which opened earlier this year in London under Too Hot to Handle co-creator Laura Gibson, is staying put and continues to build, insiders said. Related Stories Executives Chernin Entertainment Elevates David Ready To President Of Film As Jenno Topping Inks New Deal With Company News Caroline Hollick Exits North Road After A Year Frouman, a former Red Arrow Studios boss and head of Will Smith’s Westbrook International, was hired by Chernin in 2022 as Chernin formed North Road and paid $200M for Red Arrow Studios’ U.S. assets including Love is Blind producer Kinetic. Frouman’s LinkedIn indicates that he left North Road last month and has since become a strategic advisor to Israeli studio Sipur, a long-term partner of North Road’s. North Road declined comment. Watch on Deadline Frouman was President of international at North Road since its inception and ran the operation from the UK capital. During his tenure, North Road worked on splashy international co-pros including Israeli shows Bad Boy and Heart of a Killer (both with Sipur), along with Brazil’s Suture. It also bought Turkish indie Karga Seven and Mexico’s Perro Azul, while overseeing the opening of Kinetic’s UK hub. North Road was consistently rumored to be in the running for bigger international M&A plays such as All3Media but these did not come to pass and at times things have felt slow-going internationally, while high-profile executives such as Kristin Jones and Caroline Hollick exited during Frouman’s tenure. A number of his support staff have left in the past few weeks, we are told. In the U.S., North Road is behind the likes of Ford v Ferrari, Love is Blind and The Last Dance. Upcoming projects include The Body and Man on Fire for Netflix. The news comes as yet another tortuorous round of layoffs hits the U.S., most recently at Paramount-Skydance, Amazon and Fifth Season, with redundancies expected to hit Paramount internationally imminently.

Title: International Insider: Doctor… Who?; Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest; Steve Coogan Settlement
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/10/doctor-who-disney-deal-international-insider-1236602867/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T13:00:00Z

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the clocks have gone back, but we move forwards. Max Goldbart here taking you through the week’s headlines. Sign up here. Doctor… Who? No Disney regeneration: One of this decade’s splashiest industry deals came to an abrupt end this week, as Disney confirmed what we’d all been waiting for and killed its Doctor Who co-production pact with the BBC after just two seasons, having spent circa-£150M ($200M) on the sci-fi series thus far. Deadline had teased this happening as long ago as last summer, and the reality, per our deep dive this week, was that Disney appeared to have regretted signing on the dotted line not long after it did so in 2022. At that time, the streamers were splashing the cash as they looked to beef up their platforms to take on the might of Netflix, but the open check book era ended as quickly as it began, as Bob Iger re-took the Disney reins and started scaling back. The show never quite rated for Disney+, neither did it garner awards buzz, and the period has also collided with something of a “woke” backlash as MAGA politics seeped into commissioning at the very top, which may have had an impact on a series that unashamedly places diversity front and center. All in all, Doctor Who is a quintessentially British show that was maybe not quite primed for a mainstream American Disney audience. For now, the BBC needs to carve a new path for The Doctor, one that will see its budget slashed by at least half unless it can find a new American partner, amid question marks over how long showrunner Russell T Davies will remain in the saddle (he is penning an Xmas special for 2026 but no news yet on further seasons). Keep an eye on this one – it’s been quite the ride in the TARDIS. Related Stories Executives YouTube TV Calls Disney "Unnecessarily Aggressive" In Carriage Talks, With "Antiquated View" Of Pay-TV Economics Executives YouTube TV Is Out To "Eliminate Competition", Disney Execs Tell Employees In Carriage Fight Update Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest Watch on Deadline IDFA sparks debate: The International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) stoked debate this week over its decision to exclude Israeli state-backed organizations and films from every aspect of its 2025 edition amid growing international condemnation of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The event – which is the biggest documentary festival in Europe, if not the world – is the first major film festival to make such a move. It marks a blow for Israel’s mainly left-leaning documentary community, which has found itself increasingly isolated on the world stage following the launch of a boycott pledge in September, which has since been signed by close to 2,000 high-profile figures from the film world. IDFA’s new Artistic Director, Isabel Arrate Fernandez, told Deadline that the decision to bar Israel state funded orgs and films was not tied to that pledge, but rather in keeping with the festival’s new ‘Principles and Guidelines’. The decision has been greeted with dismay by many Israeli documentary professionals who point to their tradition of documenting and critiquing Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians, as well as the efforts of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to shut them down. “We will continue to make films, even if we have to film them on our cell phones and screen them in our living rooms,” Michal Weits, the Artistic Director of IDFA-barred festival DocAviv, told Deadline. Steve Coogan’s Settlement “Defamation David and Goliath”: In the world of entertainment, truth and fiction often blur. When this results in a courtroom battle, the public (and press) tends to pay attention. Following on from the high-profile Baby Reindeer suit (still to be resolved), headlines came Monday when Steve Coogan’s Baby Cow and Pathé paid “substantial damages” to a university professor who accused them of defaming his character in a pic about the search for King Richard III’s remains. A title card has also been added to The Lost King’s credits noting the portrayal of Richard Taylor is fictional. Taylor said representation of him and his behavior towards Philippa Langley (played by Sally Hawkins) in the movie was damaging. Coogan and co had to pay out, but the film’s creator and star was adamant that he didn’t really do anything wrong, as he pointed out in a Guardian op ed that the film has barely been altered and that potential star witness Langley was too ill to attend court. These fallouts are always interesting to follow as they raise questions around poetic licence, fictional representation and that good old fashioned “based on a true story” disclaimer that we audiences are oh so familiar with. Taylor’s action and Coogan’s response could set a precedent for many a movie to come. Japanese Animation Goes Big “New Cool Japan Strategy”: Good news for Japanese animation this week as our Asia expert Liz Shackleton brought news of record revenue. Last year, Japan’s animation industry grew by 14.8% to hit a whopping ¥3.8TR ($25BN), a mighty figure for an industry that has long punched well above its weight with fans from all over the world. Encouragingly, the report from the Association of Japanese Animations found that much of the rise came from overseas markets, which accounted for 56% of the total. Overseas revenue for Japanese animation first overtook local in the early pandemic era, colliding with global streaming platforms starting to accelerate distribution of Japanese anime overseas. Japan’s government is positioning anime and related media as a core industry under its ‘New Cool Japan Strategy’, setting a rather ambitious target of reaching ¥20TR ($130B) by 2033. Paramount Layoffs Never painless: We all know that M&A is never painless. This week, pain hit the newly-minted Paramount-Skydance, as around 1,000 employees were let go – mainly in Hollywood – a move that will likely impact international over the coming weeks. Few departments were spared, with staffers let go across news, movies, TV and back office. As Insider goes to press, the international fallout is beginning to be felt. Along with 100 layoffs in the U.S., CBS News is closing its bureau in Johannesburg, and its Race & Culture Unit – established in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd – is being eliminated. Meanwhile, we revealed last night that Lisa Kramer, the LA-based President, International TV Licensing at Paramount Global Content Distribution, will exit. The popular distribution executive was a mainstay at international markets and will be sorely missed. Long-serving SVP, Comms, Jennifer Weingroff, and Tony Augi, finance head for the distribution business, have also been let go. Paramount-Skydance wasn’t the only one making deep cuts. Amazon MGM Studios and Fifth Season have also initiated redundancy programs, as has North Road in London, with international president Jan Frouman exiting. With the spotlight on a Warner Bros.

Title: Amazon’s latest layoffs are not about AI replacing jobs

On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced it would lay off around 14,000 of its corporate workforce, potentially increasing to 10% of the total global corporate workforce or more than 30,000 employees in 2026. In the announcement, senior vice president of the company’s HR team, Beth Galetti, emphasised the role of AI in changing company operations, stating, “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Some have taken this to mean that Amazon is replacing corporate workers with AI tools. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more However, the truth is not so straightforward. AI cannot directly replace Amazon’s corporate employees because it is not advanced enough yet to replace entire job roles. However, skyrocketing demand for AI solutions, combined with other factors like the tech hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed to Amazon’s decision to focus on maintaining financial health while increasing its AI spending. Accelerated demand for digital solutions, ecommerce, video streaming, and other online services during the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a hiring spree across the tech industry. At the time, Big Tech saw the increased use of digital services by businesses and consumers as the new normal. This led Amazon to invest heavily in its technology business, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), and grow its workforce significantly. In 2021, Amazon added more than 300,000 full- and part-time workers, taking its total headcount to 1.6 million people. Based on the October 28 announcement, it is estimated that around 80% of the roles cut are in Amazon’s entertainment arm and in operations (HR, recruitment, advertising, marketing, and ecommerce functions) across other Amazon businesses. While these roles are heavily at risk of being automated by AI agents, there is no clear evidence that Amazon is replacing these roles with AI. In reality, Amazon is doubling down on its AI investments as a key corporate priority and needs to cut costs to maintain profitability. Beth Galetti’s statement highlighted the company’s desire to be “organised more leanly.” It should come as no surprise that Amazon is betting heavily on AI. According to Goldman Sachs, AI will drive a 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030. As the world’s largest public cloud provider, AWS is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for data center usage. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. AWS is Amazon’s most profitable business unit, making up 58% or around $40bn of Amazon’s total operating income in 2024 despite contributing just 17% of net sales. Despite this, its profit does not cover anywhere near the amount of investment Amazon requires to fulfill AI data center demand. The company intends to spend as much as $118bn in capital expenditure in 2025 alone. To keep up in the race for AI dominance, Amazon needs to increase investments in building data centers, develop graphics processing units (GPUs) with improved computing power, and buy GPUs when it cannot manufacture them fast enough. To do this, the company must keep borrowing capital, which requires strong financial health and a substantial cash flow. Amazon’s executives and investors see corporate restructuring and the resulting layoffs as necessary to keep the company’s financial health in check. So, is AI the reason for Amazon’s latest layoffs? The answer is yes, but not in the way many have assumed. It’s true that, in June 2025, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told employees that increased use of generative and agentic AI would lead to job cuts. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in a memo to staff. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today”. While AI can already automate some corporate tasks, it is not yet replacing human staff. However, the demand for AI solutions and cloud services to support AI development is directly responsible for the latest round of layoffs.
