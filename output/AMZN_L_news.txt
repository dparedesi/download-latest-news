Title: My Mack Weldon underwear is still holding up after years of wearing and washing — here's why they're my absolute favorite boxer briefs

When it comes to underwear, men have three basic options: briefs, boxer briefs, or boxers. When it comes to which brand a man chooses for his underwear, the list gets a bit longer. Actually, it gets dizzyingly long. So when I find a company making boxer briefs I love, I stock up, and I've loved every pair of boxer briefs I've gotten to try for my Mack Weldon review. So far, that's three pairs. Not a huge stock, you might say. But here's the thing — each pair is still in superb condition. Whereas other boxers from other brands have come and gone from my rotation in that time, with waistbands stretched out, fabric worn bare, and other such issues, these garments are going strong, maintaining their support, comfort, and color, too, and that despite lots of use and washes. While all of my Mack Weldon boxers are excellent overall, they each have their own qualities, so let's break things down pair by pair. These are probably the best boxer briefs I've ever tried. They have just the right fit, offering comfort and support without compression. They're not snug like, say, a pair of bike shorts, but they're a far cry from the baggy cotton boxers you wore in seventh grade. I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside). The fabric blend (50% polyamide, 33% polyester, and 17% elastane) offers plenty of stretch and wicks sweat well. The legs never bunch up with these boxers, which is much appreciated when I'm stepping into a meeting, in a shop, walking down a city street, or anywhere else where adjustments might be awkward. The 18 hours here doesn't refer to how long you can wear these boxers. You can do that for as long as you want. Instead, it refers to the period for which the fabric is allowed to rest after production prior to its use in constructing the garment. The result is a pair of boxer shorts that have a consistent, comfortable fit that won't change over time. These boxers are largely made of cotton and have a more relaxed fit, so I never use them for exercise, but for lounging at home or sleeping and taking it easy. They do ride up a bit under tighter pants, so just avoid that pairing. As with the Jersey boxers, because these boxer briefs are largely cotton, I don't recommend them for use during any intense exercise, as they just don't breathe as well as synthetic (or wool) fibers. On the other hand, these have a closer fit than the Jersey boxers, and they won't ride up your leg. Because these boxers feature antimicrobial Silver XT2 fiber, they prevent bacteria and odor build up, making them a great choice for extra-long wear, especially during travel. While hardly a bank-breaking price point, Mack Weldon's underwear is more expensive than options you'll find from myriad other brands. If you want to find decent boxer briefs for cheaper, I might recommend a three-pack from Calvin Klein for $32. On the other hand, if you don't mind paying a good deal for your boxer briefs and you want a pair with some unique support and anti-chafe features, you may want to consider the pairs we tested in our SAXX review, which offered a unique "BallPark Pouch." Also, watch out for a bit of ride up with the Jersey boxers, but you can avoid that by wearing them with looser pants and not wearing them for workouts. Mack Weldon boxer briefs have just the right fit. Each pair I have offers enough support to keep things in place but without making me feel constricted and without causing excess heat buildup. As I noted earlier, I've been weaning my three pairs in regular rotation for years now, and that means dozens and dozens of wash and dry cycles. Their colors have held, they're still stretchy and supportive, and they still grip my body evenly and don't bunch up or create lines visible through pants. Long story short, these boxer briefs are a good buy. While the price point of Mack Weldon underwear might be a bit higher than some men are used to, their value is beyond question. They are comfortable from the first wear and they hold up well over time, remaining supportive and without going threadbare, even after years of being tossed around in the laundry.

Title: Trump administration hopes AI can mitigate staffing losses, federal CIO says

Kevin Carter/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Trump administration is “100%” looking to artificial intelligence to make up for the loss of thousands of employees across federal agencies, a top Trump administration tech official told Nextgov/FCW in a recent interview. “I think [AI] is the number one thing that is going to help people mitigate the staffing shortages,” said Gregory Barbaccia, the chief information officer for the U.S. government, a position with oversight of the federal government's technology that’s housed within the Office of Management and Budget. Barbaccia, who's also been identifying himself as the federal chief AI officer, was a former longtime employee at data analytics company Palantir. In one of his first interviews after about eight months on the job, Barbaccia spoke with Nextgov/FCW about the administration’s vision for AI and how it intersects with the White House’s push to shrink the size of government through both layoffs and voluntary incentives. Since Trump took office in January, over 148,000 civil servants have left the federal workforce. The biggest challenge in his role, Barbaccia said, “is how to do more with less — how to still have the level of efficiency, following up on your agency’s mission for the taxpayer, operating in an environment of lean staffing.” “AI is a huge part of that, so that’s a major focus for me,” he added. Another priority is data, Barbaccia said. Enterprise data platforms — central systems connecting data from across an organization — are “what’s going to power AI and advanced analytics to actually get people [sic] more efficient,” he said. “AI is going to be a huge part of this, all these manual, repeatable tasks.” “What AI needs to be doing,” Barbaccia continued, “is collating and collecting this data that a human needs to make a decision and getting it to them in a way that makes sense, in a way that's quick, so they're able to make a decision with all the information they need as quickly as possible.” Barbaccia’s remarks come days after the launch of USAi, an evaluation platform meant to help agencies adopt AI models from Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and OpenAI, some of which recently cut deals with the government to offer their software for nominal fees. Proponents of AI say it could aid the government in making sense of its vast troves of data, support federal employees and offer real-time help to people seeking government assistance without them having to call agency phone lines. “How do we use tech to take the excellent humans that we still have and make them as efficient as possible?” Barbaccia said of AI. “How do we get them doing what they were doing before, but doing it way faster and better?” The “holy grail” is “if we're automating more things that can be done by a computer, what are humans doing that they could not do before?” he added. Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service — a nonprofit focused on good government — told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that “federal leaders, as stewards of public funds, have an obligation to leverage cutting-edge technology to address our collective problems.” “The federal government can and should take concrete steps to enhance the technical capacity of its workforce to fully take advantage of all the possibilities AI has to offer,” Stier added. “The civil service needs to evolve, but it cannot be replaced by AI.” Those more critical of AI have cautioned about its potential to cause harm or automate bias at scale, a point especially relevant as the Trump administration has targeted so-called “woke” AI. Critics say that cracking down on AI tools deemed to be too woke could chill both free speech and AI-focused risk management in government agencies. There’s also questions about the reliability of the technology — generative AI models can produce plausible-seeming but ultimately false outputs called hallucinations — and the fact that many agencies have lost staff that would presumably be called upon to implement new AI solutions. “It's very early days for the use of AI in government services. But what we do know is that the approaches that work well are those where the employees drive the process of integration in a bottom up and grounded way,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination and Redesign at Brown University who did a stint in the Biden administration. “What doesn't work is firing government workers who have expertise and then trying to use AI to replace their years of knowledge and experience,” Venkatasubramanian said. “And what certainly doesn't work is forcing the remaining workers to be constrained to use only AI tools that conform to Administration speech requirements. Fast is not synonymous with better, and in fact is often the opposite of it.” As for the data to power AI, the Trump administration is already pushing agencies to more easily share data, and its Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of many headlines and lawsuits over its hoovering up of government data. In the spring, Wired and CNN both reported that DOGE is building a “master database” with data from different agencies to track undocumented immigrants. The New York Times also reported on the expanded use of Palantir across the federal government. House Democrats also issued a whistleblower-informed report in April alleging that DOGE was building a cross-agency database of sensitive information from the IRS, SSA and other agencies. Barbaccia maintained that he doesn’t know of such an effort. “I can’t find it for the life of me,” he said. “I have no insight into any sort of master database going on. I asked agencies at IRS and SSA. They don't have anything they're building outside of their internal data. I've asked the vendors who are in the news, too. They're not tracking what the news is about.” “I think it’s people misunderstanding what different vendors do,” he said.

Title: Who Killed the Narrative Podcast?
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/narrative-podcasts-gone-serial-over-my-dead-body-1235409945/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:51:05Z

By Eric Benson “I have a hook for your story,” a podcast producer told me as soon as I called her up earlier this summer. “Pineapple Street announced it’s going out of business today.” I’d already been reporting on the collapse of the narrative podcast industry for several weeks, talking with executives and editors and producers. Everyone had pretty much the same thing to say: things were looking grim. But this news felt personal. I’d hosted and written two shows for Pineapple Street Studios. I had several close collaborators who were still on staff. Even when I was just a fan of podcasts, I knew the name Pineapple Street — it was a pioneering production company and industry leader. They’d made the mega-hit Missing Richard Simmons in 2017, then spent almost a decade churning out award-winning narrative shows like The Catch and Kill Podcast, Ghost Story, and Hysterical. A few years ago, Pineapple Street going out of business would have shocked me. But when I heard about its demise on that Thursday afternoon in June, it felt sad but inevitable. If you haven’t been paying close attention, the idea that a segment of the podcast industry is existentially imperiled may seem counterintuitive. More people than ever are listening to podcasts and talking about podcasts and thinking about starting their own podcasts. Politicians trying to win elections are clamoring to go on podcasts. (When they lose, it is blamed, in part, on not going on the right podcasts.) A recent report from Edison Research estimates that 55 percent of Americans over the age of 12 consumed a podcast in the last month, an all-time high. But the podcasts that are thriving are talk shows — increasingly celebrity-driven talk shows — that are cheap to make, can easily be turned into streaming YouTube videos, and command big ad dollars. Narrative podcasts — the multi-episode, investigative journalism–fueled shows that boomed after the release of Serial in October 2014 — have followed an inverse trajectory. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century For years, narrative podcasts were the buzziest segment of the industry. They were what many listeners thought of when they heard the word “podcast.” Many of these shows, following the lead of Serial, were true crime, while others, like Slow Burn, took a similar investigative approach to politics and history. But regardless of genre, most narrative shows shared a style — they were told through the perspective of a single reporter-host, who not only guided a listener through a story but invited them along on the reporting journey. Now, these shows seem increasingly like an artifact of history. Layoffs have hit nearly every organization that makes this kind of audio, from corporate behemoths like Spotify to successful start-ups like Pushkin Industries to the public-radio godfather of it all, This American Life. In early August, Amazon announced it was dismantling Wondery, one of the biggest and most commercially successful studios in the business, which had made its name on shows like Dr. Death and The Shrink Next Door. Amazon had acquired Wondery less than five years ago for $300 million. Now, the company was being broken up into parts and a reported 110 staffers were laid off. “It feels like podcasts speed-ran the development of an industry to the decline of an industry,” the journalist and podcast host Evan Ratliff told me. “It went from people were making absolutely no money, to people were making fortunes big enough where they’d never have to work again, to ‘There’s not a budget for that’ in less than 10 years.” Now, even those reduced budgets have vanished. The fall of the industry has been so vertiginous that it’s been hard to fully comprehend its decline. But in many ways, this collapse was baked into its spectacular rise, when a flood of dumb money, pollyannaish entrepreneurs, and hungry journalists rushed to build an industry that would soon turn into a house of cards. YEARS BEFORE I STARTED MAKING podcasts, I thought I was already too late to get in on the craze. This was the mid-2010s, and after Serial, it felt like every other month brought another expertly crafted narrative series. There was the first season of In the Dark, and S-Town, and Missing Richard Simmons—podcasts that not only got millions of listeners but were covered in the mainstream media as events. They got picked over, debated on social media. They felt like they mattered. So when my friend Matthew Shaer asked me if I might be interested in making a podcast with him in the spring 2017, I leapt at the opportunity. Related Content 'The Yogurt Shop Murders' Director on the 'Cursed' Story That Haunts Austin 30 Years Later Four Things We Learned From Netflix’s New Son of Sam Docuseries They Were Accused of a Brutal Murder. Can She Prove Their Innocence? Margo Price Keeps the ‘Bastards’ at Bay on Rolling Stone's New Podcast ‘Nashville Now’ Matt told me he’d happened upon a story about a Florida State University law professor named Dan Markel who had been shot to death outside his home in Tallahassee in 2014. Two alleged hitmen had been charged in the case, but authorities believed the masterminds behind the murder were family members of Markel’s ex-wife. Matt had tried to pitch it xas a magazine story, but he’d struck out, which turned out to be a lucky break. The Markel case was convoluted, had tons of backstory, and there was hours of archival audio from police wiretaps and stings. In other words, it was perfect for a podcast. Matt and I spent months developing the idea, then we pitched it to Wondery, which was fresh off its first big hit, Dirty John. Within a couple weeks, we’d signed a contract to make a six-episode show. We wanted to call it Tallahassee. Wondery’s CEO Hernan Lopez, a shrewd former television executive, opted instead for the crass but grabby Over My Dead Body. He said he liked titles that were phrases people actually said. In mid-February 2019, the night before Over My Dead Body was released, Wondery hosted a launch party at the Ace Hotel in New York. They billed it as the “exclusive world premiere of 2019’s next blockbuster.” Lopez, Wondery’s CEO served as master of ceremonies, insisting that all the attendees blindfold themselves while listening to the first episode. Afterward, Matt and I went to dinner with Marshall Lewy, Wondery’s chief content officer, who told us about his attempt to court an Oscar-nominated screenwriter to adapt Over My Dead Body. That particular screenwriter had declined, but it hardly mattered. The show hit number one on the Apple podcast charts and stayed there for weeks. That summer, the actress and director Elizabeth Banks optioned the show for development. In 2019, the movie and TV industry just couldn’t resist a good podcast. “My friends in Hollywood would be like, ‘People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about graphic novels or comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies,’” Jenna Weiss-Berman, the co-founder of Pineapple Street, tells me. “Then everyone was like, cool, this is going to be an amazing business.” “People don’t care about books anymore, people don’t care about comic books, they just want to make podcasts into movies” In truth, narrative podcasts had always been a strange business. Requiring months (and sometimes years) of reporting and an exhaustive writing and editing process, they were expensive to produce and struggled to attract enough advertising to pay for their budgets. (Weekly chat shows, with their consistent audiences and parasocial relationships between host and listener, were always a safer bet.) The Hollywood money could help close the gap, and when a show struck big like Wondery’s The Shrink Next Door — which had a purchase price of $1.25 million and numerous associated bonus fees — narrative podcasts could turn a tidy profit. But podcasting still seemed like a relatively modest offshoot of magazines and public radio. Then Big Tech changed the math entirely. A week before the Over My Dead Body launch party, Spotify announced that it was acquiring the podcast studio Gimlet for a reported $230 million. Spotify had been looking to reduce its dependency on record labels while also becoming a one-stop shop audio company, and Gimlet — which made highly produced shows — was a key plank in that strategy. To most people in the industry, Spotify buying Gimlet made sense, but Spotify buying Gimlet for $230 million seemed, to quote one longtime producer, “totally insane.” (As Brian Reed, the host of S-Town, noted to me, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a similar sum in 2013. ”A five-year-old podcast company being valued at the same amount as one of the biggest legacy media brands ever — that, to me, encapsulates the bubble we were in,” Reed says.) Gimlet had routinely struggled with profitability. Now, their founders and investors had cashed out for a quarter-billion dollars. ”It was like Spotify dropped a wallet in the street and Gimlet picked it up — it could’ve been any of us,” one former podcast executive told me. It wasn’t long before other wallets started dropping. In August 2019, Pineapple Street, a considerably smaller company than Gimlet, sold to Entercom (later rebranded Audacy) for $18 million. In July 2020, the New York Times bought Serial Productions for a reported $25 million. That December, Amazon announced its $300 million bet on Wondery. These companies weren’t buying narrative podcast shops because they thought narrative podcasts were a can’t-miss business. They saw them as part of their grand corporate maneuverings. One former Pineapple Street staffer tells me an Entercom executive had said during the acquisition, “We don’t need you to make money. We want you to make shows we can brag about.” Soon, Sony, Apple TV+, and Amazon were aggressively commissioning narrative podcasts from independent producers, too. New companies like Campside Media (co-founded by my Over My Dead Body reporting partner Matthew Shaer) cropped up to feed the beast, churning out narrative series for the big players while hoping they might follow Pineapple Street and Serial Productions and get acquired for a spectacular fee. As money swelled the ranks of the industry, it also gave it a sense of staying power. Narrative podcasts couldn’t be written off as a fad. They were a new medium, the savior of longform storytelling. A day after Spotify acquired Gimlet, the National Magazine Awards unveiled the finalists for their first-ever podcasting prize. Later that year, the Pulitzer Prizes announced they were adding an “audio reporting” category. Podcast hosts like Serial‘s Sarah Koenig and S-Town’s Brian Reed were going on late-night shows. Hulu was launching its Emmy-winning comedy series about true-crime podcasters, Only Murders in the Building. Big-time print journalists like The New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe were jumping into the world of narrative podcasts and loving it. Keefe tells me that not only was making his show, Wind of Change, one of the “happiest, most creatively fulfilling experiences” of his career, but he saw audiences respond to it in a lasting way. “On book tour, there are always people who show up, having read none of my books, and want to talk about Wind of Change,” Keefe says. I was feeling optimistic too. Over My Dead Body had been just the beginning for me. I made a campaign-trail podcast for Texas Monthly called Underdog: Beto v. Cruz; I was reporting and writing the investigative true-crime series Suspect and executive producing a story of drug-smuggling and police corruption called Witnessed: Borderlands. Then there was my show Project Unabom, about the 18-year manhunt to find Ted Kaczynski, which I’d gotten greenlit off a pitch that was barely a paragraph long. I was busier than I’d ever been, and I was already discussing new projects that would keep me occupied for the next 18 months. At the time, I was a staff writer for Texas Monthly, which had once seemed like a dream job. But in December 2020, I quit. I wanted to write and produce podcasts full time. I had caught the bug. I wasn’t the only one. IN THE SUMMER OF 2016, Connie Walker was looking for a new way to tell stories. She was a television reporter at the CBC News in Toronto, where she specialized in covering indigenous issues. She had a big audience, but she also found that she was frustrated by the quick-hit nature of TV news. Walker is Cree and grew up in the Okanese First Nation in rural Saskatchewan, and she wanted to bring history and context into her stories. Almost always, she had to leave that on the cutting room floor. Podcasts had been a revelation. She’d gotten hooked on Serial and was inspired by its immersive approach to storytelling. So she pitched her bosses on a podcast about the unsolved 1989 murder of Canadian woman from the Gitxsan nation. Walker’s bosses were television people. They’d never overseen a podcast before, but they cautiously agreed. She had a tight deadline and a tiny team, but plenty of editorial freedom to tell the story of an indigenous community in the way she wanted. “I think for a long time there was just this feeling that our stories weren’t important or that Canadians wouldn’t care,” Walker tells me. “And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams? debuted that fall, and it quickly found an audience. Walker tracked the ins and outs of the case, but she was after something larger: “We started this story looking for answers about Alberta Williams’ unsolved murder, but the deeper we got into the story the more I thought about the bigger questions,” Walker says at the beginning of the fourth episode. “Why are there over 1,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada? My hope in telling Alberta’s story is to begin to connect the dots.” “For a long time there was this feeling that our stories weren’t important. And it was finally our chance. So we just took it and ran with it.” Within a couple months of the show’s release, Walker was connecting even more dots, reporting a new season that tracked her search for a long-ago missing Cree girl named Cleopatra Semaganis Nicotine. But midway through production, Walker’s manager told her that it would be her last podcast. “She was like, ‘This takes too long. It’s too expensive. This is it,’” Walker says. And I was like, ‘it hasn’t even come out yet.’ And she said, ‘management doesn’t support it.’ Missing & Murdered: Finding Cleo was a breakout hit, but the CBC stuck to its decision. Walker went back to making television, but soon she was looking for a new employer. In the summer of 2019, she was invited to meet with a few executives at Gimlet, which had just been acquired by Spotify. As soon as she walked into their Brooklyn offices, she was wide-eyed. The CBC offices looked like what you’d expect from a public broadcaster — drab carpeting, dated computers, refrigerators full of sad office lunch. Gimlet’s offices were all start-up pizzazz — designer furniture, gleaming cutting-edge equipment, break rooms stocked with free sparkling water and a cornucopia of snacks. Even better, Gimlet offered Walker its full editorial backing. “I was begging at the CBC, like ‘Please let me,’ and with Gimlet it was like, ‘What can we do to support you and your vision of the podcast?” Walker says. “It really was like a dream come true.” Walker’s Gimlet show, Stolen, continued the work she’d started with Missing & Murdered. In the first season, she investigated the recent disappearance of a young mother named Jermain Charlo, but in the second season, Walker broke the mold, focusing on a mystery involving her own father, Howard Cameron, and the abuse he and his peers suffered at the St. Michael’s Residential School, which had been established as part of a government policy of forced assimilation. It was a dark, personal story, and Gimlet gave Walker the time and the team to pursue the most ambitious work of her career. Gimlet’s largesse was worth it. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s won nearly every award for which it was nominated, including the Peabody and the Pulitzer. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was one of the strongest cases imaginable for the existence of narrative podcasts. The resources at Gimlet had allowed a reporter to investigate a deeply personal story, then broaden the scope until she’d crafted a furious indictment of institutional abuse and racism. Just as importantly, the behind-the-scenes transparency of the medium had taken what could have been a dry exercise in accountability journalism and injected it with the sizzle and suspense of a police procedural. And the voices of the survivors themselves gave it an intimacy and force that would have been almost impossible in another medium. But when Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s was winning the biggest awards in audio journalism, Walker’s triumph was tempered by the fact that Gimlet itself was a husk of its former self. The problems had burst into public view two years earlier with accusations that one of Gimlet’s flagship shows, Reply All, had created a hostile work environment for non-white staffers. That had led to a reckoning inside the company and, within a little over a year, the end of Reply All. Other longtime Gimlet shows, which were siloed as “Spotify exclusives” and unavailable on other platforms, started bleeding their audiences. New shows had trouble gaining traction. In October 2022, Spotify, under pressure from investors to reduce costs, began culling its original podcast offerings, cancelling several Gimlet shows and laying off dozens of staffers. By the end of that year, Gimlet’s managing director, Lydia Polgren, and its co-founders, Alex Blumberg and Matt Leiber, had all departed the company. Then in June 2023, less than a month after Walker’s Pulitzer and Peabody wins, Spotify shut down Gimlet and put its few remaining shows under the mantle of Spotify Studios. In just four years, Spotify had turned $230 million into zero dollars. Spotify spared Stolen for a few months, but that December, it too was cancelled. The news wasn’t a surprise to Walker. “I feel like we knew kind of before we knew,” she says. She and her team were allowed to stay on and finish their third season, Stolen: Trouble in Sweetwater, but when its final episode was released in April 2024, they were all out of work. In some ways, this was familiar terrain for Walker, echoing her experience with the CBC. But the podcast industry was in a vastly different place in the summer of 2024 than it had been in the summer of 2019. Gone were the days when studios like Gimlet were flush with cash and hungry to buy up new talent. When Spotify cancelled Stolen and another former Gimlet show, Heavyweight, a company spokesperson said they would “work with the show creators to ensure a smooth transition for wherever these series go next.” But there was nowhere to go next for Stolen. When Walker reached out to podcast studios and media companies, they didn’t try to woo her at their venture capital-funded offices. She couldn’t get anyone to make her an offer at all. Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s had felt like undeniable proof of what she’d been trying to convince people of for her entire career — “that these stories are important, that there’s an audience, and that they can have an impact.” But that moment had faded. Two months after Spotify cancelled Stolen, the company signed a new $250 million deal with Joe Rogan. THE NARRATIVE PODCAST INDUSTRY HAD always been an awkward mash-up of characters — public-radio true believers, Hollywood producers, magazine refugees, and eventually tech executives — and it had always been a little unclear what the goal of making these shows really was. Were they entertainment or journalism? Should their success be measured in awards and social impact, or by their ability to turn a buck? Did these podcasts exist principally for their listening audiences, or were they really, when you got down to it, just proof of concept for film and television development? The different segments of the industry always had different answers to these questions, but for a time, while the money was flowing, it felt like podcasts could be everything to everyone. The precious journalists could strive for their Pulitzers, and the wannabe Ari Golds could have their Hollywood deals. The answer to every binary choice was “yes.” But then the money started to go away. The tech and media giants that had funded the podcast boom had learned that narrative journalism was hard to scale. In 2019, it might have been enough for them to make shows that “we can brag about,” but a few years later, as recession fears grew, losing money on prestige programming no longer seemed like a good idea. “Podcasting has been a drag on the gross margin side,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said in January 2023, “Some shows worked, some didn’t perform as we expected. And that is a sign of maturing. You go for growth first and then you seek efficiency.” As 2023 went on, Ek and his competitors tacked hard toward efficiency. “Places that were buying these shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000?’” Weiss-Berman, the Pineapple Street co-founder, told me. “Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” For years, the industry had been building itself up on the premise that the demand would only grow for prestige TV-like narrative shows and budgets would remain robust. When the big tech companies cut back, the first solution for the production companies that depended on them was mass layoffs. The second was closing up shop entirely. For anyone making a living in podcasting, the future started to look like finding a new line of work. “Places that were buying shows for $1 million started to say, ‘How about $500,000? Then it was, ‘How about $400,000?’ Then, ‘How about $300,000?’” At the beginning of this year, that’s how it was looking to me. I’d spent much of the previous two years writing and producing two shows that had both been killed by their commissioning companies. They weren’t bad. I’m pretty sure they were good. But they didn’t sound exactly like something that had come before, which meant they weren’t easily slotted into a pre-existing feed. By then, a conservatism had set in. The industry of “yes” was now beginning to resemble the worst of Hollywood. Creative executives, under pressure to churn out hits, were increasingly micromanaging the process, engaging in what one award-winning host described to me as a “firing line approach to editing.” In February, I finished up a show that actually got released, the Wondery podcast Death County, PA, which had showcased the high-impact prison reporting of the journalist Joshua Vaughn. Then, for the first time since 2018, I faced a world in which I had no offers for new podcast work. But I don’t know if I’m done with podcasts, even if a certain kind of corporate-backed, lavishly budgeted narrative show appears to be extinct. My favorite podcast from the last 12 months is called Shell Game, and in many ways it’s a playbook for what might come next. Hosted and reported by Evan Ratliff, a longtime tech journalist and one of the hosts of the Longform podcast, Shell Game is an experimental series about artificial intelligence, and in many ways, it’s a rejection of the compromises that had become baked into making shows for Big Podcast. “I knew it was going to weird,” Ratliff says. “And I wanted to be as weird as possible. I didn’t want to be forced into analytic conclusions about AI, the kind of places you get pushed by people who are trying to sell your show.” Of course, by the spring of 2024, when Ratliff started making Shell Game, he probably wouldn’t have found anyone to fund it anyway. But that was fine. Ratliff figured he could do it cheaply with a small team. He hired Sophie Bridges, a producer he’d worked with previously, and leaned on the expertise of his wife, Samantha Henig, who had founded and led the audio division of the New York Times. The tiny team didn’t diminish the quality of the show. And part of what’s so wonderful about Shell Game is it’s a story that could only exist as a podcast. Ratliff created an AI voice clone of himself and set it loose in the world. In the show, we hear AI Evan interact on the phone, often hilariously, with a series of interlocutors, starting with customer service representatives and scammers and building to two sessions with an unwitting human therapist via the online platform Better Help. Shell Game made several best-of-the-year lists, and Ratliff says it broke even. (The revenue came almost entirely from subscriptions to an affiliated Substack.) Then, it won a $50,000 prize from the Independent Media Initiative, which made it profitable. But breaking even is a tough business model, and prize money isn’t something you can count on. For Season Two of Shell Game, Ratliff is collaborating with the independent podcast studio Kaleidoscope, which has given him more a financial cushion while still allowing him to make the show he wants to make. “They’re into telling a story that sounds as far from any formula as possible and helping us try to do that,” Ratliff said. That’s how the future might look: smaller, more independent, more experimental, but also with fewer shows being made and basically no hope of striking rich. But that future is hard to see from the present. At the moment, the narrative podcasts that are making it to the top of the Apple charts are tabloid-y true-crime, often affiliated with TV shows like Dateline and 20/20. Pineapple Street has vanished, Wondery has been gutted, and many of the surviving production companies are trying desperately to pivot to weekly chat shows. Nearly every producer and editor I worked with in podcasting — across seven years and 12 shows — is struggling to find work. Some are piecing together freelance gigs doing field reporting for news-radio outlets. A few are staffing chat shows. One talented producer I know is now working for a fly-fishing magazine. Another started a successful food Substack. An entire generation of journalists who started in podcasting are leaving and are unlikely to return. And many of the most respected and experienced producers, editors, and reporters in the industry are out in the cold too. Connie Walker is one of them. When I spoke to Walker in late June, she was about to start a new job as a journalism professor at Toronto Metropolitan University. There, she’d be continuing the work she began in Stolen: Surviving St. Michael’s, collecting the testimony of residential school survivors and building out an archive of the abuses that took place. That work is certainly worthwhile, but when we spoke, Walker was open about the fact that her “new dream” was to turn that work into another podcast. In retrospect, the boom years of narrative podcasting were always a kind of dream. When she went to Gimlet, Connie Walker felt like she’d won the lottery. Sometimes I felt like I had, too. Now, that era is definitively over. A few people got rich. Many more came out the other side with no job, and if they were lucky, a few months severance. Whatever comes next will be built up in the shadow of that history — that it all looked so good and that so many of us bought into the mirage. We want to hear it.

Good morning. Many of their colleagues were downsizing and preparing for their "empty nest" years. But one couple in their mid-40s moved in the opposite direction: they bought a bigger house. They don't always use the space, the cleaning is endless, and the bills are higher. A decade later, they're convinced they made the right decision. In today's big story, we all face an AI-supercharged job market. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, while hiring managers revealed how they're adapting to identify real talent. What's on deck: Markets: Are you struggling as a day trader? This psychologist might know why. Tech: It's not just Big Tech that's clamoring after AI engineers. Everyone wants to date them. Business: Like their customers, millennial-coded brands are facing the cold, hard reality of aging. But first, hand-delivered is hard to ignore. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Perhaps you did everything right. You spent hours researching the company. Hours more rewriting your résumé. The cover letter? Polished, professional, and personal. You click "submit." And wait. The days spin into weeks. The inbox never dings. You're not alone. White-collar hiring has slowed, layoffs feel de rigueur, and many who do have jobs are clinging onto them — whether they're happy or not. "My dream job might exist," a frustrated Gen Z job seeker told BI. "But I'm one of 400 people applying for it." The issue cuts both ways. For hiring managers, their dream employee might also exist. But amid a crowd of AI-generated applications, they may never find them. BI spoke with people on either side of the hiring divide. Job seekers shared how they're trying to stand out, and employers revealed their strategies for spotting real talent. They're going old school. Job seekers are getting creative, with some finding success going back to basics: handing in a paper résumé in person. Businesses are adapting, too. With AI tools now helping with résumés, cover letters, and even live interviews, measuring a candidate's suitability for a role can be challenging. Is this the person we want to hire — or just the AI that coached them? Victoria Thomas, the chief business officer of a Porsche customization and racing company, said AI-crafted résumés can make candidates seem more qualified than they really are. To combat this, her team flies candidates to their Wisconsin office for in-person interviews and tryouts. The workplace is changing — and so are the rules for job searching. BI has tapped HR managers, recruiters, career coaches, and executives for their best advice on everything from crafting a standout résumé to networking your way to a final offer. So, before you send off that job application, you can find everything you need to gain an edge here. 1. Meet the 16-year-old prodigy at Citadel Securities. Kairan Quazi, a quant developer at the New York trading giant, caught the world's attention when he landed a job at SpaceX at age 14. He told BI why he switched from Big Tech to quant finance. 2. What makes (and breaks) a day trader? Andrew Menaker, a psychologist who coaches traders on and off Wall Street, has an answer. He said ego and aggression are traits that lead traders astray, and shared tips for those trying to get in on the trade. 3. Where to invest if the market goes south. If you're holding cash right now, it's a good idea to have a strategy for buying the dip in case a bear market hits. Two rules of thumb: Don't enter the market all at once, and don't panic. Here's where experts suggest investing. 1. In Silicon Valley, the ladies want a tech nerd. Professional matchmakers in the Bay Area — whose fees range from $5,900 to $500,000 — told BI more women are looking for AI engineers, thanks to their high salaries and job stability. It's not clear how long interest will last, but for now, the AI boom is making nerds sexy. 2. The startup turning Elon Musk's DOGE-fueled chaos into cash. Legalist, a startup founded by one of Peter Thiel's fellows, provides gap financing for vendors awaiting payouts from the federal government. Here's how they cashed in on the havoc DOGE wrecked. 3. How these Gen Zers beat the odds to score roles in tech. The industry is hemorrhaging entry-level jobs thanks to AI and corporate cost-cutting. Young workers told BI how they scored roles after casting a wide net or networking around the clock. 1. Millennial brands hit middle age. Glossier is at Sephora. Mideas are having holes drilled in them. What once seemed like an industry adjustment toward direct, values-centered relationships with consumers has been exposed as a marketing ploy — and today, these brands are either dying or becoming boring companies, BI's Juliana Kaplan writes. 2. Spotify's ad business is laggy. Advertising made up 11% of its business in June, a far cry from its 20% target. "We have simply been moving too slowly," CEO Daniel Ek said on the company's latest earnings call. Industry insiders said poor customer service and low podcast ad rates were also factors. 3. The AT&T CEO's blunt memo is a test case for leaders. Since BI was the first to report on AT&T CEO John Stankey's viral memo to managers, hundreds of readers, including leaders, have weighed in. BI spoke to current and former CEOs for their thoughts on the memo. Three tips for employees to manage their wellbeing in a challenging job environment, from EY's Chief Wellbeing Officer.

Title: Monday: Hili dialogue

Why Evolution Is True Why Evolution is True is a blog written by Jerry Coyne, centered on evolution and biology but also dealing with diverse topics like politics, culture, and cats. Another damn work week is on tap: it’s Monday, August 18, 2025 and also National Bad Poetry Day. For a collection of the absolute worst bad poetry, get this book. It’s hilarious (click for Amazon link): And then read some poems by the very WORST BAD POET IN HISTORY, William McGonagall. Here’s one of his more famous poems, “The Tay Bridge Disaster.”, about a railroad bridge in Scotland that collapsed with a train on it, killing many. The last verse: It’s also Cupcake Day (in Australia), National Fajita Day, Helium Discovery Day (it was “discovered” on this day in 1868 by Pierre Jules César Janssen), National Ice Cream Pie Day, and Pinot Noir Day. Wikipedia says this about helium: the “discoverer” is different from “the detector.” Anyway, it’s complicated: Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig, Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel, and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. However, only Lockyer proposed that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today. Here is some helium: Readers are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the August 18 Wikipedia page. Da Nooz: *Today European leaders, along with Ukraine’s President Zelensky, will meet with Trump in Washington about the Russian/Ukraine war. As you know, Europe is much more favorably disposed to Ukraine than is Trump, who seems will to almost give the country away so he can get his Nobel Peace Prize. From the NYT: European leaders said on Sunday that they would join President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine when he meets with President Trump on Monday at the White House, as they strive to present a united front against Russia and avoid being sidelined in peace talks. The presence of at least six European heads of state — including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Alexander Stubb of Finland, two of Mr. Trump’s favored counterparts — highlights the continent’s effort to smooth relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, whose last White House meeting in February descended into a public clash. European leaders have spent months cultivating ties with Mr. Trump to strengthen their hand in pressing Ukraine’s case, while also coaching Mr. Zelensky on how to better engage with Mr. Trump. On Sunday, the Europeans met online and in person with Mr. Zelensky to prepare for the meeting in Washington. “We’ll give a few good pieces of advice,” Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany told the German television broadcaster ZDF ahead of the meeting. . . .Mr. Trump will first meet with Mr. Zelensky. The two leaders are then scheduled to join a working lunch and a larger meeting with all the European leaders, according to European officials familiar with the preparations for the White House meeting. The meeting will come three days after talks in Alaska between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ended inconclusively but fueled concerns in Europe that Mr. Trump’s thinking may have tilted toward Russia’s position. On Saturday, after his summit with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump sided with the Russian president in calling for a direct peace agreement that would be likely to see Ukraine cede unconquered territory to Russia, rather than securing a cease-fire first. Negotiations toward a peace agreement rather than an immediate cease-fire would give Russia time to continue exploiting its advantage on the battlefield to seize territory before front lines are settled in any deal. Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Zelensky and European leaders had agreed on the point. But earlier in the week, the group had called for refusing to discuss peace terms until a cease-fire was in place. Although much of Europe is wrong in trying to recognize Palestine in search of a “two state solution,” here they are right. Trump, who promised to end the war in Ukraine on Day 1, now says he didn’t really mean it (duh!). And under his plan, what does Ukraine get out of a deal save the end of its citizens being killed? Will Russia give it back Crimea? Don’t hold your breath. Nor will Ukraine get to keep what border Russian territory it’s now occupying. This is not a compromise, but a bullying of Ukraine to bow to Trump. Fortunately, Zelensky is not an invertebrate, and Europe may be able to apply pressure to Russia to effect some compromise. But for me, from the beginning of this war the only “good” outcome was for Russia to lose and pull back into its own territory. After it, it invaded a sovereign nature without good cause, just like Hitler with Austria and Czechoslovakia. Russia is now insisting that it should keep all the Ukrainian territory it has taken over, and will take over until there is a peace agreement. *California governor Gavin Newsom has promised to retaliate against Texas’s redistricting to do his own redistricting that would counterbalance five new Republican seats in Congress with five new Democratic seats in Congress from California. I don’t like either of these moves, though if you aren’t American you might find them amusing. But a WSJ op-ed warns of a greater danger to us Democrats than this tit-for-tat gerrymandering: people are moving to red states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is promising a referendum in November to gerrymander five more Democratic House seats on top of the 43 of 52 they already have in the state. Even if it works, his victory may be short-lived. The real problem for Democrats is that progressive policies are driving population flight, which on current trend could cost their states 10 House seats after 2030. Migration from blue to red states is one of the great stories of the age. It accelerated during the Covid lockdowns as Americans fled states with high taxes and living costs—and disorderly streets and lousy schools. Sayonara, San Francisco. Hello, Salt Lake City. Start with the raw numbers. Between 2020 and 2024, California (-1,465,116), New York (-966,209) and Illinois (-418,056) lost the population equivalent of Kansas to other states. Texas (747,730) and Florida (872,722) gained the equivalent of West Virginia. Utah, Idaho, Arizona and North Carolina also experienced a rush of newcomers. Births and foreign migration have somewhat lessened the population losses in Democratic-run states. But their populations are nonetheless aging as young people and families leave. Between 2020 and 2024, California’s population under the age of 18 shrank by 523,000, while New York’s fell by 250,000 and Illinois’s by 186,000. School closures during the pandemic no doubt contributed to their loss of children, but maybe parents also don’t want their children learning about the varieties of sexual experience in third-grade or being taught that America was founded to preserve slavery. Just a thought. Texas gained 199,000 children and Florida 219,000 in the same period. While slowing immigration under President Trump will dampen population growth in some Republican-led states like Texas and Florida, it will steepen losses in many Democratic states. Notable, though, is that many immigrants who initially come to New York, California and Illinois later leave for other states—for the same reasons native citizens do. Only about one-third of immigrants who came to California between 2010 and 2023 on net stayed in the state. Immigrants who arrive in Florida and Texas are more likely to settle there. California’s foreign-born population increased by about 600,000 between 2010 and 2023, versus roughly 1.5 million for both Florida and Texas. Despite their policy failures, Democrats have used gerrymanders to entrench their power in statehouses in California, New York, Illinois, Maryland and elsewhere. Population flight cost Democratic states several House seats during the last Congressional reapportionment following the 2020 Census, but they lost fewer seats than expected. That’s partly because Covid lockdowns increased the risk of miscounting college students and people with second homes. Perhaps Floridians with pied-à-terres in Manhattan were counted as New Yorkers. The Census Bureau in 2022 reported that New York’s population was over-counted by 3.4% while there were under-counts in Florida (3.5%) and Texas (1.9%). Such inaccuracies may have cost Florida and Texas an additional House seat and given Rhode Island, New York and Minnesota one each they shouldn’t have received. Tough for GOP Speaker Mike Johnson. But if population trends continue, Republican states stand to gain at least 10 House seats in the 2030 reapportionment. The left-leaning Brennan Center estimated in December that Texas and Florida would each gain four House seats while Utah, Idaho, North Carolina and Arizona would each add one. California would lose four, New York two, and Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island one each. Yes, but what this article forgets is the midterm “bounce” that favors the Democrats. It’s possible—indeed, likely, that disaffected Republicans may stay home during the midterms, or would vote Democratic because of Trump’s tariffs and the rising cost of living (they are connected, of course). I myself would be unwilling to bet which party would hold a majority of the House of Representatives after the midterms. *Perhaps in response to those misguided souls who criticized “our” book (i.e., a collection of essays edited by Lawrence Krauss for playing into the hands of Trump by criticizing the Left’s attack on science —didn’t you know that the Right is the real Destroyer of Science?), Krauss has written a piece in Reason magazine called “America’s two-front war on science” (subtitle: “Universities’ internal culture wars threaten free speech and inquiry, but political attacks on research funding and infrastructure are crippling U.S. scientific leadership”). There is currently a two-pronged attack on higher education, research, and scholarship in the United States. Activists inside universities have hijacked many administrative functions, and significant reform is needed to ensure free speech, open inquiry, and the integrity of scholarship. But the Trump administration has used this fact to launch what may be a more dangerous direct attack on university scientific and research infrastructures across the nation. We can’t afford to lose either war if we are to protect the country’s scientific integrity and productivity. Harvard University epitomizes the quandary we now find ourselves in. Over the last decade, it succumbed to much of the modern culture war in ways that have threatened faculty and students, and even prospective students. Students and researchers have alleged that Harvard has discriminated against Asian applicants, rigorously policed speech, and punished faculty whose research results didn’t match preconceived notions about racism or who stated that there are only two sexes, while allowing antisemitic conduct. In addition, the university promoted staff based on identity rather than academic accomplishments, including those known to have plagiarized academic work, while discriminating against talented students and scholars on the grounds of their race or sex. Harvard is by no means unique. Bloated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bureaucracies have taken root at academic institutions around the country. The University of California at Berkeley biology department, for example, in 2019, disqualified 76 percent of the applicants for a faculty position based solely on their DEI statements—before examining their research . . .Prestigious scientific journals, such as Nature Human Behaviour, have indicated they will not publish scientific articles if they could cause offense or a sense of harm to certain groups. Physical Review, a major journal in my own field of physics, went so far as to publish a case study positing that the use of whiteboards in classrooms could be viewed as a remnant of white supremacy. The situation has set back scientific and scholarly progress, and has undermined the credibility of many academic disciplines among the public. At the same time, President Donald Trump has not only launched a frontal assault on Harvard but has also removed leading scientists from national advisory boards and federally supported research institutions, and declared war on universities and departments that don’t bow to his political agenda. Perhaps most damaging of all, this administration is proposing to end support for most cutting-edge American research programs. This includes cutting the National Science Foundation budget by almost 60 percent, and killing major projects—from closing half of the Nobel Prize-winning Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, to ending U.S. participation in the next generation space-based detector, to considering closing the NASA-Goddard space center, where most of the science at NASA originates. The administration’s attempts to paint all university faculty as woke are misguided. Many leading scientists and scholars have continued to push the boundaries of knowledge while either ignoring ongoing culture wars or avoiding administrative activists on their campuses. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is never a good idea, nor is schadenfreude worth risking the future of knowledge. The proper way to fight one form of intolerance is not to impose your own brand of intolerance. But of course nobody who has gone after the book (or Lawrence) on the grounds of mostly criticizing Leftist attacks on science will pay any attention to this. This claim that we can’t criticize the Left’s attack on science because it plays into the hands of Trump reminds me of those idiots people who said I should not criticize Kamala Harris until after she won the election because otherwise I’d be supporting Trump. (Of course I spent plenty of time criticizing Trump, too.) And of course I didn’t vote for Trump. Further, those criticisms ignore the possibility that the wokeness of the left, even in science (e.g., declarations that “trans women are women” and the like) also played into the hands of Trump, who spent more money on that one issue that on any other issue in the election. Our job is to criticize people as we see them, and not to ignore only the transgressions on “our side” because it makes us look bad and could make us lose. I’ve explained many times when I see my brief as purifying my own end of the political spectrum, or at least calling it out, since everybody in the MSM is already going after Trump and his administration. *If you’ve ever been to Yosemite National Park in California, you’ll know that (despite the crowds in some places) it’s one of the most beautiful places in America. Yet, as reader Rachel Dec writes at The Free Press, the park is getting “quietly gutted” due to Trump’s budget cuts. (The article was originally published at The Dispatch.) It’s very sad: You’re stuck in a snaking line of cars in 80-degree heat, tour buses idling behind minivans. The scent of pine still cuts through the fumes. The websites warned of hours-long queues, but miraculously your car’s tires roll past Yosemite’s entrance gate in less than 25 minutes. “Very quick for a summer Saturday,” a ranger jokes as he hands you a map. “You should have seen it last weekend.” After a half-hour descent into the valley, you can finally get out. High above, the granite cliffs are so tall they don’t fit in your iPhone’s viewfinder. Among the network of tall pines, you’ve never been so small. That’s Yosemite for you. Home to more than 400 species of animals, 1,500 species of plants, and roughly 4 million annual visitors, the park has stood, since President Abraham Lincoln first preserved it, as a radical idea: that some landscapes are too magnificent to belong to private individuals, and instead should be given to the nation. Today, this legacy is at risk. Over the past six months, permanent staff at the National Park Service (NPS)—which is the agency that governs the park—have been cut by 24 percent. It’s the result of layoffs, buyouts, and a hiring freeze from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This year, of the 8,000 seasonal positions allotted by President Donald Trump’s budget, barely 4,500 were filled by July. At the same time, the government has moved aggressively to open more public land to mining, logging, and energy extraction. . . .On a desperately hot July Saturday, I came to Yosemite to see how these pressures were reshaping the park. Out on the trail, tourists could be heard grumbling about the four-hour queues at the park’s southern entrances, but few noticed the creeping overgrowth of invasive Himalayan blackberry along the trails. But there are a few tangible signs of decline: a sold-out bike rental shop, overflowing trash cans, volunteers answering basic questions outside the visitor center because of the long lines to speak to the rangers inside. Recent online reviews of the park’s campsites complain of “dilapidated bathrooms without soap or paper” and “pitiful” conditions. Artifacts relating to the park’s natural history were recently stolen as a result of low staffing, forcing every building in its Pioneer History Center to temporarily close. Speak to workers, and the prognosis is alarming. In Yosemite, there is growing unease that a diminished ranger corps will struggle to manage not just the impact on wildlife, but on people. The park averages around 200 search and rescue operations per year, and many warn these lifesaving missions will soon be dangerously understaffed, and therefore slower and less effective. While emergency medical workers are technically exempt from the Trump administration’s funding cuts, staff from other divisions are generally brought in to support large emergencies—so falling head counts elsewhere will have spillover effects. If I didn’t know that Trump won’t be President after January, 2029 (and if you think he will win a third term, email me and I’ll bet you otherwise), I’d say we should be campaigning against his re-election. (I’m not at all sure now that J. D. Vance will succeed him, though I used to be pretty sure.) When foreigners planning to come to America and ask me where they should go, I always tell them to the National Parks in California: Sequoia, Yosemite, Death Valley, and then up the White Mountains to see the bristlecones and then north of San Francisco to see the tall redwoods. If Trump ruins these glories (logging, my tuches!), well, I don’t know what I can do except chain myself to a tree (which doesn’t work). *A library book has been returned after the death of its borrower—82 years after it was taken out. Fortunately, there were no overdue fines. But that’s not even close to the record for overdue books! A library book has been returned nearly 82 years after it was borrowed from the San Antonio Public Library. It came with a letter noting that “Grandma won’t be able to pay for it anymore.” The book is “Your Child, His Family, and Friends” by marriage and family counselor Frances Bruce Strain. It was checked out in July 1943 and returned this past June from a person in Oregon, the library said in a news release. “After the recent death of my father, I inherited a few boxes of books he left behind,” the person wrote in a letter that was shared by the library on Instagram and signed with the initials P.A.A.G. The book was a guide for parents on helping their children navigate personal relationships. It was checked out when the person’s father was 11 years old. “The book must have been borrowed by my Grandmother, Maria del Socorro Aldrete Flores (Cortez),” the person wrote. “In that year, she transferred to Mexico City to work at the US Embassy. She must have taken the book with her, and some 82 years later, it ended up in my possession.” . . .The library said in a news release that it eliminated overdue fines in 2021. The inside cover of the book was stamped with the warning that the fine for overdue books was three cents a day. Not accounting for inflation, the penalty would amount to nearly $900. Three cents in July 1943 amounts to 56 cents in today’s money, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Inflation Calculator. That would add up to more than $16,000. The library noted that the book is in “good condition.” It’ll be on display in the city’s central library through August. It will then be donated to the Friends of San Antonio Public Library and sold to benefit the library. Eight decades may seem like a long time for an overdue library book, but it’s nowhere near the record. Guinness World Records says the most overdue library book was returned to Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge, England, in 1956. It was borrowed in 1668, some 288 years earlier. No fine was extracted. Meanwhile in Dobrzyn, Andrzej calms Hili down: Hili: Everything’s becoming more tangled. Andrzej: Yes, but it’s something we’ve seen before. In Polish: Hili: Wszystko się komplikuje. Ja: Tak, ale to znane zjawisko. ******************* From Clean, Funny, & Cute Animal Memes: From CinEmma. Look at that tuches!

Rowling (@jk_rowling) August 17, 2025 From Luana; I didn’t see “Barbie” (well, I watched part of it but didn’t like it), so I don’t know what homosexuality they’re talking about. But this article explains that it happened in a suburb of Paris, and the cowardly mayor refused to say that the objectors were Muslims: Mayor Olivier Sarrabeyrouse announced the cancellation publicly on Monday (11 August), alleging that “an extreme minority of thugs, who, no doubt, had not seen the film, transformed a simple free open-air cinema screening open to all into a violent opposition movement”. 🚨 NEW: A Barbie screening has been cancelled after Muslim men complained about “homosexuality” in the film.

I was lucky enough to see her perform when she was in her prime. I suspect the Lavrov “photo” shown by Masih is a fake, though it does seem to attempt to portray something that he actually wore. It was reported in Foreign Policy journal on 8/15. (and elsewhere) It is real. Real for sure. Lavrov, when not consorting with lithe little hookers on his friends’ yachts in Turkey, is a dedicated troll. Having the meeting in Alaska is funny – given they sold it to us once (for something like twenty bucks. hahahaha). Talk about the worst real estate deal of all time. D.A. NYC The photo posted by Masih is clearly fake, as the sweatshirt seen there does not match the sweatshirt seen in the legitimate press coverage. Compare, e.g. the double stripe on the collar in the fake photo vis-à-vis that in the legit coverage. And in none of the legit press footage does one see all four of the letters CCCP, only the middle two or so. Yes, the image of Lavrov in Masih’s tweet shows clear signs of having been AI-generated. In addition to the differences from the press photos that Jared points out, which prove the point, there are a number of other giveaways: the overall honey-tinged sepia tone (which this image has in common with all those AI going-out-of-business ads for fake mom-and-pop leathercrafter and shoemaker shops), the undersized proportions of the upper arms, the schematic fall of the folds in the sleeves, and the just-so placement of the video camera in the background. So while the spotting of Lavrov with a presumed CCCP sweatshirt appears to be real, this specific image tweeted by Masih and others seems to be an AI fabrication. A “CCCP” anecdote. When I first noticed it (over 60 yers ago) I thought it stood for the Central Committee of the Communist Party, definitely not for the Soyuz Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik. Live and learn. I must admit that I do not know or understand the difference between good and bad poetry (please do not yell at me for this). I can appreciate soaring prose. As I have written in this space in the past, I, unlike Jerry, did not take full advantage of the liberal arts education offered me in college. I know the Tay bridge disaster as do all engineers as an engineering failure as it is cited by the late civil engineer and engineering historian Henry Petroski in his books “To Engineer Is Human” and “Pushing the Limits”. That is, I can distinguish between good and bad engineering design, but I really cannot distinguish between good and bad poetry. We have seen this movie regarding underfunding of the National Parks numerous times unfortunately. It derives from those of our citizens who, at their extreme, believe that the only purpose of a federal government and thus its funding with citizens’ tax dollars is to protect us from foreign invasion. No vaccinations to protect against epidemics, no support of the arts, no support of basic science research, and no support for national parks as refuge and inspiration for all citizens. I was fortunate years ago to spend several weeks backpacking through Yosemite by entering from the Stanislaus forest to the North along the Pacific Crest Trail. Never saw a road or a building. The landscape was spectacular! When I come across verse in a book I’m reading, I get a bit annoyed that the writer is making me do a bunch of extra work. I had an excellent liberal education (I think), but reading poetry is so much work! Just say what you mean and don’t make it a puzzle that I have to struggle to figure out.* *I had a good liberal education (I think), but not all of it took. I concur with your observation, particularly when the verse is in another language. (Another AI™ collaboration): I think that I shall never see A form of words like poetry. It gives us voice to share our hearts, A way to speak when silence starts. In every line, a truth can shine, A gift of thought, both yours and mine. (FWIW, the AI™ eventually came up with almost all the words, but despite several promptings never got the scansion right for the second line. Sort of the poetry equivalent of flubbing 2+2+2+2 = 8. But it does appear very good at faking sincerity.) You should try reading Vogon poetry. Why bother? I write it. HAHAHAHAHAHA! I’m with you there, Jim. It’s courageous of you to admit it first. Stephen Leacock, Canada’s foremost humorist of the early 20th century (before all our literary output got decolonized and indigenized — at least now there are objective criteria for judging merit) once observed that while persons of his acquaintance were never shy to admit they had no critical sense of music, and were even proud to confess they couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket, every single one would wax indignant if he suggested to them that they probably had no sense of humour, either, since the two were typically correlated in his experience. I suspect the same is true of poetry. I do have to give props to Mr. McGonagall’s effort in (sort-of) rhyming “buttresses” with “confesses”. This is called a feminine rhyme, as opposed to the more common masculine rhyme where the very last syllable in the line rhymes with the very last syllable in the line of the scheme. This restricts the poet to one-syllable words at the ends of rhyming lines, or to words (often foreign) with the accent on the last syllable. Working in a feminine rhyme is a nice touch. A better example herewith: A swashbuckling pirate named Gates Did dance the fandango on skates. Till he tripped on his cutlass Which rendered him nutless And practically useless on dates. If you like it it’s good. Same thing with wine and food. I looked up the authors & poems listed in the Contents for the poetry book and was disappointed to note the lack of Dawn Watson’s enigmatic, “Bird on the School Path.” Ok, so maybe it doesn’t descend to the depths of ‘worst’, but it is certainly inscrutable. Or something. And then there’s Bad Cinema. I like Bird on the School Path! Or, at least, it made me laugh. The poem instantly evokes the image of this common behavior on the part of birds – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFWq5T_ROsg – – which, if you didn’t know better, really does look as if the birds are going “WTF is with all these leaves?” That said, I agree that it’s not exactly on a par with The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock or The Second Coming PCC(E) : “Here is some helium:” Am I the only one who read that in a high-pitched voice? 😃 “Here is some helium.” I even clicked on the image just to be sure I wasn’t missing something. More coffee… The Islamic Paris Barbie thing is a worrying trend in many places. Surrendering to Islamic intolerance is a deeply concerning recent development. Re criticisms of the left. I am similarly situated politically as PCC(E) and I also spend more of my time in my column, on X, and general loudmouth duties (I am a busy fellow) …criticizing leftist idiocy. There’s no shortage of GoP and right wing idiocy but I regard it as so self beclowning as to be hardly worth my time. And indeed, done well enough by the MSM. Like… parents spend more time disciplining their OWN children rather than the kids of the idiots next door. 🙂 Glad JKR is not in favor of Scottish independence (though my Scottish grandma would roll in her grave…) as it is wholly a bad idea. D.A. NYC @DavidandersonJd https://themoderatevoice.com/author/david-anderson/ (see? Loudmouth!) Thank you for bringing Prof Krauss’ Reason article to our attention. This is not an either/or issue but rather both. The ideological left has been hollowing out university science research AND now the right is zeroing it out. Even if full funding were restored today, the unis have some serious housekeeping to do as has been pointed out both on this site and in Prof Krauss’ excellent “The War on Science” compendium. I do think, as an outsider to today’s university, that while we are fixing funding issues and the telos of the university, we also have to ask about balance of good teaching and research. Is the sole purpose of the university to produce knowledge, or rather has it a dual purpose in producing knowledge and the next generation of educated citizens, some of whom will carry on with producing the next generation of knowledge? What is a proper teaching load for faculty? How many deans, assistant deans, associate deans, etc does it take to administer a department? There is a four-minute video of a (recently) late friend of Jerry’s and mine, former chair of the econ dept at William and Mary, Prof Will Haussman, speaking in part, in 2010 about this dual requirement at url Let me try a model using the Gordian knot story (lo-tech flowchart style ): Woke Left radical power creates Gordian knots | V Power shift away from Left … somehow… | V Woke Right radical power cleaves Gordian knots | V Left assumes power by outrage over the Right | V Repeat from top … these are the two ends of the political horseshoe model that’s out there. What goes hidden is the wokeness of the Right. If the new book (The War On Science, Krauss, ed.) can get the radical Left demarcated from the non-radical Left, that will be a major achievement. I was recalling the politicization of stem cell research (remember?), and rethinking it in light of radical activism. I think there’s something to it. Amen Brother. It’s telling that common academic parlance refers to “research opportunities” and “teaching loads”. Excellent picture of Helium! What type of camera did you use? Himalayan Blackberry in Yosemite? That stuff will take over the entire park in short order if it isn’t killed. (Around here in the Pacific Northwest, people advertise that they will “Kill Blackberry Permanently.” Yes, not temporarily dead, permanently dead.) Our roadsides are covered with this stuff. The tough seeds get caught in vehicle tire treads and get spread along every roadway, creating impenetrable walls of brambles. The Himalayan Blackberry prickers are super sharp and robust, making them even worse. The blackberries are delicious, their only grace. And, of course, there’s the rest of the news. We’ll see what happens with Ukraine. I hope that Zelensky and Trump can be civil with each other for long enough to meet with European leaders later in the day. That’ll be the first test. Yes, Trump wants to win a Nobel prize, but there is a more charitable interpretation of his actions. He may be pushing for an end to the war simply because he deplores the loss of life—even if that leads Ukraine to have to cede some territory. He does talk a lot about “stopping the killing,” so maybe he actually believes it. Today’s meetings will be interesting and perhaps even consequential. I’m with you all the way re Himalayan Blackberry and its evil twin, Evergreen/European Blackberry (I bet they hybridize). I have a 30-year struggle with them in our coast Range property. I’m winning, but they will always be there. They must be dug out by the roots and replaced by robust trees and shrubs. Now then how about Japanese (aka giant) Knotweed? An equally pernicious foe, praised by empty-headed herbalists as it crowds out everything. National Bad Poetry Day: Well I’m a native of the very city, Dundee, that William Topaz McGonagall scrieved his extraordinarily excruciatingly bad verse. Indeed an old artist friend of mine lived just two doors up from McGonagall’s old residence in Step Row. Directly across the Perth Road from my old alma mater in the 1990s, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, was the haunt of us art students, an excellent pub called McGonagall’s where you could enjoy a pint or four of superb ales whilst perusing framed examples of Mr Topaz McGonagall’s truly jaw droppingly appalling “poetry”…unfortunately the pub changed management years back and lost that uniquely entertaining character. On yesterday’s Gaza colleague loss: I’ll read all the comments later, but just to say I’ve lost two lifelong friends over this. Weirdly, neither knew pretty much anything about the issue more than what they’ve seen on PBS and the Aust.B.C. respectively. So basically Hamas propaganda. So it is a loss, for sure. Not as serious as me abandoning truth and morality however. I won’t do that. And the trans scandal has actually cost me MORE people. hahah So a more lonely few years. ‘ef ’em. Writer, unwoke Lionel Shriver asserts that it is mostly the more leftist party leaving a friendship in these kinds of clashes and in my experience she is correct. D.A. NYC re: Gaza. Leslie’s two pieces about the ballistics and dynamics of rocketry there is totally accurate. And his discussion of Dresden, WW2. So. I’m yet to be persuaded, after studying this since I was a teenager and my degree in the topic, extensive travels and study of the Arabic language, my published articles, etc. (I’m not an expert but rather a well informed person) that there are ANY civilians in Gaza beyond infants. We constantly try to place the conflict within our cultural lens. Big mistake. “Palestine” is sui-generis – there is no country like it. Not only is it ENTIRELY Islamic – hard Islam – which has the specific antisemitism built in via the Koran (I can provide letter and verse if you wish)… but the entire NOTION of a Pal State, its moral and philosophical architecture is towards one single unifying goal: The destruction of the State of Israel. This dynamic exists nowhere else on earth – lots of people hate their neighbors, some attack and invade, or they covet their stuff, don’t like their ideology, etc. but NONE have their founding charters (ALL OF THEM) and almost entire public belief… demanding the extinction of another country. And precious little else! Beyond Sharia. The above are the “missing pieces” as well as the primacy of Islam.. which we’re not weighing into our analysis. We shouldn’t treat this conflict which is unlike any other, as if it is. D.A. https://x.com/DavidandersonJd “I’m yet to be persuaded … that there are ANY civilians in Gaza beyond infants.” A trenchant comment by my druthers! I know that I have brought this up before, but it seems to me to be a point worth repeating as I seem to be the only person talking about it. One of the first things the IDF reported after their initial entry into Gaza, was that every other (!) domicile contained a hidden munitions cache, usually under a child’s crib or bed. We are talking about machine guns, ammo, grenades, etc. All the things one would need to eliminate Hamas’ so-called “soldiers” if one wanted to. So why have they not done so? Why? I can not come to any other conclusion other than – they do not want to. Aside from preschoolers, they have been inculcated their entire lives to hate Jews, and trained how to murder Jews for the glory of Allah. They have been taught, many in UN schools, that Israel is their rightful territory, and that martyrdom is the truest good and path to glory. Multiple MEMRI videos attest to this. Multiple polling attests to this. Multiple on-the-street interviews with Gazans YouTube videos attest to this. Multiple interviews with former Gazans and Hamas operatives confirm that the vast majority of Gazans believe this. Someone, anybody – please tell me another way how to explain this video made 9 years ago (possibly in Judea/Samaria not even in Gaza?) of a Palestinian father urging IDF soldiers to shoot his young Palestinian flag-bearing son for the camera?: I, for one, believe David Anderson has hit the nail on the head. Try this link to see video: There is no homosexuality in the Barbie movie, but there are openly gay actors playing parts, and one character in the movie was interpreted as being possibly gay. According to Google AI: “While the Barbie movie doesn’t explicitly feature any textually gay characters, some viewers interpret certain characters, particularly Allan, as having strong queer coding. Allan, played by Michael Cera, is often seen as a queer icon due to his outsider status, distinct fashion sense (a rainbow-striped crocheted shirt), and his role as an awkward, non-conforming character in a world dominated by Barbies and Kens. Additionally, the movie features several openly LGBTQ+ actors in various roles, including Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and Scott Evans. ” Anyway, I liked the movie but it takes a lot of suspension of belief. The last line in the movie made me lol. I watched the entire movie and it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Still, Ryan Reynolds (?) the dude playing Ken, did not deserve an Oscar nomination. Kate McKinnon was hilarious as always. What angered me was a trans-identifying male playing a Barbie. Why the director/casting agents thought that anyone would think he is a woman is beyond me. “the use of whiteboards in classrooms could be viewed as a remnant of white supremacy” – does that mean we should go back to using blackboards? Certainly. And with white chalk as the active principle. But B boards are so empty, and they are frequently erased. Before W boards were a thing I took a corporate course where they had boards textured like a B board, but white. Instead of markers they used coloured (oops?) chalk, usually blue. My main recollection is that the chalk dust visibly got on everything, particularly clothing. Your email address will not be published.

Oracle has cut over 300 roles in the US When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings have confirmed Oracle has laid off over 300 workers in Washington and California. The redundancies consist of 143 workers in Redwood City, California and a further 161 in Seattle, Washington, however further layoffs could also be taking place that are not covered by WARN filings. A worker familiar with the matter told The Register the figures sound low, suggesting remote workers might not be accounted for – a way of obscuring the scale of layoffs that Microsoft has also been accused of. "It feels like that happened here too, the reported numbers don't quite match up with what my network is saying," the worker said. "My estimate would be low thousands worldwide... Supposedly this is just the start, too," they added. Compared with other giants in this space, Oracle's reaction to economic uncertainties has been pretty reserved. Around 200 workers left in 2022, with some more leaving in separate sittings since then. Compared with the tens of thousands who have lost their jobs at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Oracle workers have therefore been pretty safe. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Looking ahead, The Register's source suggests thousands could lose their jobs worldwide with offices being closed and large cuts in India (around 10% of its local workforce). Artificial intelligence has been blamed for ongoing tech layoffs, but instead of AI taking human jobs, companies are having to allocate more capital towards AI data center expansions, effectively cutting their staffing budgets. In June, Oracle confirmed a revenue increase for fiscal 2025 of 8%. "Cloud Infrastructure growth rate is expected to increase from 50% in FY25 to over 70% in FY26," CEO Safra Catz noted. TechRadar Pro has asked Oracle to share further context about its recent layoffs. Any update will be posted here.

Title: Pop culture and politics are intertwined in the age of Trump. Just look at the Paramount-Skydance merger

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. My first job in the U.S. included covering Martha Stewart and World Wrestling Entertainment during the dot-com boom. Stewart was a multimedia influencer and doyenne of domesticity; Vince and Linda McMahon had transformed wrestling from a traveling circus of showmen and athletes into a superstar-studded global entertainment phenomenon. Today’s “trad wife” phenomenon or “manosphere” populated by the likes of Joe Rogan are not without precedent. Pop culture always reflects and responds to trends in the political sphere, and vice versa. What’s unusual, perhaps, is the degree to which the two worlds have become intertwined. It helps that Trump comes from that world, having spent several years in reality TV and most of his adult life as a media celebrity. Along with installing himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, President Trump personally picked this year’s list of honorees, which includes Kiss and Sylvester Stallone, and will host what he promises to be an ‘anti-woke’ ceremony. Few CEOs are more attuned to the political winds in Hollywood right now than David Ellison, the new CEO of Paramount following Skydance Media’s merger with Paramount Global earlier this month. To get the deal done, Skydance agreed to “address bias and restore fact-based reporting,” according to FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and appoint an ombudsman to address any concerns about bias. Paramount had also reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris prior to the deal getting done. In one of his first moves as head of the combined Paramount, Ellison last week announced a $7.7 billion agreement to air Ultimate Fighting Championship events over the next seven years. That’s no doubt a smart business decision and certainly not lost on Ellison that UFC is a Trump-friendly form of entertainment, as well as a “global sports powerhouse.” UFC CEO Dana White said Ellison negotiated an “all-or-nothing” deal. White is close to Trump, who recently said he’d love to stage a UFC match on the White House lawn. (White also recently joined Meta’s board, too.) Ellison, meanwhile, also struck a multi-year partnership with Taylor Sheridan, the creative mind behind “Yellowstone” and various spinoffs that are popular with conservative audiences. To grow beyond the $30+ billion it made last year, Paramount will need to appeal to a wide and varied demographic. While its cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” sparked accusations of pro-Trump bias, Paramount’s recent $1.5 billion streaming deal with “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone suggests that Ellison understands the power of polarizing entertainment on both sides of the house. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Zelenskyy goes to DC… Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington DC today, joined by European leaders including European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen.

The dispute has hurt trade and investment between the two Asian economic powers. Both countries also face steep U.S. tariffs: Trump’s decision to slap 50% tariffs on India now threatens a broader strategy to make the South Asian country an alternative to China. IgniteTech’s AI-induced layoffs Software developer IgniteTech laid off nearly 80% of its employees within a year to make way for generative AI. CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune that he’d do it again: “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” Powell to speak on Friday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will give an indication of whether rate cuts will resume next month in a speech on Friday. Some analysts think Powell will keep his cards close to his chest—and may not cut rates in September at all, despite Wall Street hopes of easing. Can OpenAI stay in front? OpenAI’s industry-leading position could be vulnerable, thanks to an underwhelming release of GPT-5 and new open-source challengers like China’s DeepSeek.

Title: Coding boom turns bust: Computer science grads face AI-dominated hiring doldrums

A decade of tech-fueled advice led to a 133 percent surge in U.S. computer science majors, now struggling in a job market flooded with AI tools. Rising AI adoption reduces demand for junior developers; some graduates apply to thousands of jobs but find no offers. 7.5 percent unemployment for CS engineers â more than double the rate for art history or biology graduates. Companies like Microsoft now funnel resources into A.I. education amid decreased hiring. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs.

Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. Graduates shift to sales or policy roles, highlighting a disconnect between education and evolving industry needs. The "learn to code" mantra once promised a golden ticket to six-figure salaries in tech, but a wave of unemployment and disillusionment has replaced that optimism. Recent graduates with computer science degrees, enticed by corporate campaigns and federal initiatives, now confront a market where entry-level roles are shrinking due to AI tools and layoffs, leaving some to seek work at fast-food chains. The National Science Foundation reports that over 170,000 U.S. undergraduates majored in computer science in 2024 â more than double the 2014 total. Yet, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis reveals that unemployment among CS engineering graduates reached 7.5 percent in 2025, far exceeding rates for non-tech majors. Manasi Mishra, a 21-year-old Purdue graduate, epitomizes the shift. Despite excelling academically, she joked in a TikTok video that her only tech interview offer came from Chipotle, the burrito chain. âTech promised magic, but reality is bitter,â Mishra said, now pivoting to a sales role after months of job rejections. AI tools pinch entry-level opportunities The rise of AI coding platforms like GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit has catalyzed a seismic shift in tech hiring. These tools can auto-generate code, debug workflows and reduce the need for junior developers. San Francisco billboards now tout A.I. software that âdebugs faster than humans,â underscoring the new reality. âThereâs a doom loop,â said Matthew Martin, an economist with Oxford Economics. âEntry-level roles â precisely where graduates seek their first jobs â are the most vulnerable to automation.â Zach Taylor, an Oregon State graduate, applied to 5,762 tech jobs since spring 2023, earning 13 interviews but no offers. âItâs demoralizing,â Taylor admitted. Now relying on unemployment benefits, heâs returned to his parentsâ home, building side projects to stay relevant. Even government roles, once seen as a safety net, face hurdles. Jamie Spoeri, a Georgetown graduate, applied to 200 jobs after a National Science Foundation internship yet encountered federal hiring freezes and A.I.-filtered rÃ©sumÃ©s. âAI isnât just replacing code â itâs replacing humans in the hiring process,â said data scientist Audrey Roller, who faced instant algorithmic rejection. Corporate and government responses: AI training vs. industry realities Leaders are recalibrating education strategies. $4 billion from Microsoft now funds AI-centric training, while the Biden administrationâs âAI action planâ repurposes federal dollars to steer students toward machine learning roles. However, critics argue this ignores structural issues like outsourcing and the saturation of A.I. tools. Tracy Camp, director of the Computing Research Association, noted that many universities still lack cutting-edge AI curricula, leaving graduates unprepared for rapid industry shifts. âSchools are playing catch-up,â she said.

Title: Ex-Washington Post fact checker hits ‘absentee owner’ Bezos, tells him to commit to saving paper or sell it

Former Washington Post face checker Glenn Kessler spoke with Fox News Digital about the paper's "absentee owner" Jeff Bezos and the challenges the news outlet faces. The Washington Post is a sinking ship with a captain missing in action. And according to its now-former fact-checker, that missing captain is its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. "He has to be committed to it. If he's not committed to it, he should find someone else to own it," Glenn Kessler told Fox News Digital. "I feel like he was kind of committed to it. And then he's kind of an absentee owner, and he shouldn't be because it's, you know, one of the prime assets of American journalism." Kessler left the Post in July after more than 27 years at the paper — and his final years there were not the best. "What's so saddening is that five years ago, I would not have imagined The Washington Post would be in this state," Kessler said. WASHINGTON POST'S EFFORTS TO COURT CONSERVATIVES COULD DRIVE AWAY ITS LIBERAL READERS, EX-FACT CHECKER WARNS Former Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler says billionaire Jeff Bezos "has to be committed" to saving the paper he owns or "find someone else to own it." (Getty images / Singerhmk - wiki commons) Kessler never considered leaving the Post until he was presented with the buyout offer, which he accepted. The Post has been financially bleeding, so much so that it reportedly was on pace to lose at least $77 million in 2024. The buyouts had targeted the most veteran staffers, aiming to cut costs and ward off layoffs for the time being. The famed fact-checker was among several high-profile journalists and columnists who have left the paper in recent months, many of whom took issue with decisions and editorial changes Bezos himself had ordered. Kessler compared the Post to "being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone" in a piece he wrote on his newly-launched Substack account. "They have to have a vision of where they want to go. And I've not seen that vision yet. Or if there is a vision, it's not been clearly articulated," Kessler said. "It's gonna be a really rocky period in the news business in the next five to ten years. And the Post needs to be prepared for that. And I kind of feel like they've lost a lot of, you know, important sailors and captains to keep the ship going. So they're gonna have to make do with less." Bezos has been the target of intense blowback by liberals, who've accused him of bending the knee to President Donald Trump based on actions that have rocked the paper. First was his decision in October to halt the planned endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. Then, in February, he launched a new mission for the editorial pages to promote "personal liberties and free markets," vowing to not publish any pieces that go against those principles. Both instances sparked rebellion among the paper's liberal readers, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of subscriptions. Several staffers also resigned in protest. But Kessler wasn't always a Bezos critic. He credited the Amazon founder for saving the Post when he bought it in 2013. "Before Bezos bought the newspaper, it was in really bad shape," he told Fox News Digital. "People forget how, you know, because the Graham family didn't really have the resources to keep it going in the new era. And there had been a bunch of buyouts and people were asked to leave. So it had been a pretty grim period then." WASHINGTON POST BOMBARDED WITH ‘CAKE’ PARTIES FOR DEPARTING STAFFERS Kessler called Jeff Bezos an "absentee owner" of The Washington Post. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Things at the Post were souring so much so that Kessler himself had been interviewing for a different job outside the paper. That was until he was offered The Fact Checker stint in 2011, which he accepted, thinking that if the ship went down, he himself could stay afloat with his own "brand." "But then Bezos bought the paper, and he invested a lot of money in the paper," Kessler said. "So the size of the staff doubled. The number of foreign bureaus probably went up [by] at least a third. The resources devoted to engineering support surged, so the web pages started loading faster, and we could do fantastic graphics. There was investment in video… And you really felt like the Post was going places, and it was actually producing better journalism at any point in the time I had worked at the Post." "And now it is just… it's like it hit an iceberg, and it's kind of drifting there, and I don't think there's a plan to rescue it. Or at least a plan to, you know, turn the ship around and get it moving in the direction it was." Kessler blamed management for being "a little dazzled" by the traffic spike that came during the first Trump administration, reaching levels "almost equal" to the Post's top rival, The New York Times. But then, unlike the Times, the Post failed to capitalize on its new readers by not expanding its portfolio. "I've sat in many meetings and had many discussions and heard lots of speeches. I still have no idea what they're trying to do," Kessler said of his former bosses. "It vaguely seems to say we're gonna appeal [to] the people… who don't really care about the news. And we're gonna provide products that would allow them to read The Washington Post and find out information they need to know," he said. "And the problem, as I wrote in my piece, is that that's what The New York Times has been doing for ten years. They have 10 million subscribers, but a large chunk of that are people that don't get the core news product," Kessler continued. "They get the recipes, they get The Athletic — the sports section, they get product recommendations, they get the games, they play Wordle." WASHINGTON POST REELING FROM BUYOUT EXODUS AS BOSSES HOPE TO TURN THE PAGE AT EMBATTLED PAPER He said the Post is stuck with "the Avis problem," citing the car rental company's old ads that claimed "We try harder," alluding to the reality it was always in the shadow of Hertz, a dynamic similar to the Gray Lady. "The Washington Post has always been No. 2. It's never had the same size circulation as the Times. I would argue news coverage was better, but maybe I was biased about that," Kessler conceded to Fox News Digital. "But now in this fragmented marketplace, people have to make a choice. What Substacks am I going to subscribe to? What newsletters am I gonna get? What networks am I going to watch? ‘Oh, I need one newspaper. I'll be willing to spend money on one newspaper,' and the default is always going to be, unfortunately, The New York Times." He continued, "It's a broader product. It has better arts coverage, theater coverage. I've never gotten an understanding of how the Post was going to combat that problem. And it sounded like the solution was, 'Oh, we're going to be like a mini-me New York Times with things to appeal to people that don't follow news.' Well, they already get that in The New York Times." The Post has scrapped an initiative launched last year dubbed "WP Ventures," meant to attract social media users. However, the paper appears to already be pivoting with Tuesday's announcement of former Axios executive editor and former Post reporter, Sara Kehaulani Goo, returning as its president of Creator Network — a new position Goo says will be "creating personality-driven content" and help provide advertisers "access" to a new audience driven by creators. The Washington Post had just implemented a round of buyouts targeting the most veteran of staffers. (Kevin Carter/Getty Images) The Times and the rise of new media weren't the only obstacles facing the Post. "Midway through my journalism career, I started saying, 'I'm working for a dinosaur.' And AI is quite possibly the meteorite that will kill off the last of the dinosaurs," Kessler said to Fox News Digital. "I'm greatly concerned about what AI is gonna do, because AI is gonna kill search. And search was how people often found our news articles." "The statistics I had seen was that four or five years ago, every 100 searches on Google yielded six clicks on a news site. Now it's about every 100 searches yields two clicks on the news site. When people use AI, a thousand searches result in one click," he continued. "So it's a dramatic difference. And if I were running a news organization, at this point, I don't know quite what I would do about that. So it's a bad time to be running a new organization. I do have sympathy for the situation that [Washington Post publisher and CEO] Will Lewis and [Washington Post executive editor] Matt Murray find themselves in right now. I just question whether or not they really have figured out what to do." Goo said in her announcement that "we're going to be infusing AI with everything that we do to help us maximize efficiency and scale." But the buck ultimately stops with Bezos, according to Kessler. "The Post was really at its high point [after Bezos' purchase]— the amount of stories we're producing, the quality of the stories was really significant. And then, traffic surged when Trump got elected and there was so much hunger and interest in the news we were producing. We kind of lost our way after that," Kessler said. "And not only lost our way, we started losing oodles of money. A hundred million dollars one year, I think the last number I saw [in] 2023 was $77 million… I think even for a person as rich as Jeff Bezos, that counts as real money." "And I have gotten the sense that he's a bit of an absentee owner. He's had other distractions, and he's committed more to some of his other enterprises, such as a space company, than he is to The Washington Post, which is really just a tiny part of his business investments. And maybe, I don't know, I hate to speculate, maybe you thought he gave us his best shot, and we blew it, and now we've got it muddled through," he added. A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, "The Washington Post is reinventing itself to be a trusted news source for all Americans. That means working hard each day to publish the most accurate news, alongside opinions that resonate across the nation."

August 17, 2025 09:49 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions.

Title: Meta spends more guarding Mark Zuckerberg than Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet do for their own CEOs—combined
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/16/mark-zuckerberg-meta-security-detail-costs-apple-nvidia-microsoft-amazon-alphabet-ceos/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T10:03:00Z
Full Content:
Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Mark Zuckerberg goes to great lengths to protect himself. It makes sense: Critics say his social networks are bad for your mental health; he’s aggressively hiring people across Silicon Valley to staff up his ambitious AI projects (which are, unto themselves, polarizing); and he owns wide swaths of land in Hawaii, which has rankled residents and activists alike. It makes sense that he might want to shield his livelihood, considering he’s almost certainly the target of public ire. According to a new Financial Times analysis, security budgets for the chief executives of 10 major tech companies climbed above $45 million in 2024—but still, nobody protects their boss more than Meta does for Zuckerberg. Across the board, companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Palantir all increased protection budgets by more than 10% year over year, driven by heightened threats and a worsening security environment for public-facing business leaders. But Meta’s security allocation for Zuckerberg reached more than $27 million in 2024, up from $24 million the previous year. This dwarfs the amount spent by peers: In 2024, Nvidia spent $3.5 million to secure CEO Jensen Huang, an increase from $2.2 million the previous year. Amazon allocated $1.1 million for CEO Andy Jassy, while former CEO Jeff Bezos continued to receive $1.6 million annually toward his personal security. Apple spent $1.4 million to protect Tim Cook in 2024, which was actually lower than the $2.4 million spent in 2023. Alphabet’s security spending for Sundar Pichai reached $6.8 million, according to public data, and Tesla disclosed it spent just $500,000 to protect Elon Musk, although industry experts emphasize that this sum represents only a small portion of his actual security expenses as the world’s richest man has his own security companies like Foundation Security. Notably, if you add up how much Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks spent protecting their CEOs in 2024, it’s still about $7 million—26%—less than what Meta spent to guard Zuckerberg. For what it’s worth, Meta’s security program is a bit different from the others as it covers Zuckerberg’s residences, family, and travel, since Zuckerberg is synonymous with Meta, né Facebook. As both CEO and cofounder, he also holds majority voting power—and a lot of people have strong feelings about Zuckerberg given his very public role in society, layoffs, and consumer privacy. Security in Silicon Valley is often managed by private security firms, many of which are staffed by former law enforcement and military professionals. Hamilton Security, founded by former FBI agent James Hamilton, provides comprehensive assessments and risk mitigation services. Gavin de Becker & Associates and LaSorsa & Associates are also considered major players, protecting executives like Musk and Bezos, respectively. Their services include risk assessment, intelligence monitoring, residential security with hardened features (e.g., Amazon’s bulletproof panels), 24/7 personal protective details, secure transportation, cybersecurity, anti-stalking measures, as well as preparation for assassination attempts, kidnap attempts, and digital threats such as deepfakes. Palantir’s Alex Karp, for example, who runs a data-intelligence company with controversial defense contracts, employs a 24/7 security detail with up to four visible bodyguards. Nvidia’s Huang, who nabbed the top spot on Fortune’s Most Powerful People in Business list this year, saw a rise in his protection budget as his net worth soared and global profile increased, including reports of being mobbed by fans. The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December led to some of the rising spend among executives, but it forced some protocol changes as well. Some companies have removed photos of leadership from their corporate websites, invested in home defenses and cyber protection, and enforced stricter travel policies: Lockheed Martin, for example, mandates its CEO use corporate jets. Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on its security spend for Zuckerberg. For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Title: Stop using AI for these 9 work tasks - here's why
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-using-ai-for-these-9-work-tasks-heres-why/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
A few weeks ago, I shared with you "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why." It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day. Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of "when not to use an AI" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think. Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right) "Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets," said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies. "That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point." To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong. Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work. This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal. Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use) This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU. Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else. Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen. Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice. Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog. Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time. You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer. As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns. Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court. Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: "There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you." She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: "It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you." While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance. Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't. Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know. Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice. Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear? When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity. Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines "plagiarize" as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own," and to "use (another's production) without crediting the source." The dictionary also defines plagiarize as "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does "present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source." Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin. Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job. The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck. It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too. According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI "to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%)." "Why are you firing me?" "It's not my fault. The AI made me do it." Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive. If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no. I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies. We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk. But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media). Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost. Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say. Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed. Earlier, I wrote "9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI," which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance. But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring. In "Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster," my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase. It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award. Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount: What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

Title: Cisco Study Explores The Truth About RTO Mandates And Hybrid Work

ByMelody Brue ByMelody Brue, Contributor. As businesses navigate the post-pandemic landscape, the debate around hybrid and remote work has only intensified. Cisco’s Global Hybrid Work Study 2025 reveals key trends and tensions around workplace flexibility, productivity and enterprise culture — a landscape where technology, human behavior and leadership intersect. Cisco’s study presents a clear shift: after waves of return-to-office mandates, the proportion of hybrid workers has dropped from 62% in 2022 to 45% today, and 72% of organizations now require some office attendance. Nearly half of those companies have increased in-office requirements compared to prior policies. This trend correlates with self-reported productivity gains (73% of employees report higher productivity) and measurable improvements in retention rates and employee well-being. Yet beneath the positive metrics lies a persistent tension: 63% of employees would accept a pay cut for more remote flexibility, and this sentiment is stronger among high performers. Results from the HP Work Relationship Index align with this point, showing that 83% of global knowledge workers would trade part of their salary for better flexibility and autonomy. The responses of top talent in Cisco’s survey also offer important insights about attrition. 78% of high-performing employees would consider leaving a company if work policies were not flexible enough. The Cisco data suggests a significant disconnect between leaders and employees on the value of mandated office attendance. From the employee perspective, 77% believe that a lack of trust drives rigid RTO mandates, and only 39% of employees agree that those mandated office days boost productivity. This sentiment contrasts with employers’ perceptions. 88% of employers believe there is a strong direct relationship between workplace productivity and frequent, consistent attendance in the office. There is another disconnect around well-being, with only 28% of employees seeing these mandates as beneficial to their well-being, compared to 42% of employers. However, this does not mean employees never want to be in the office, as 92% believe community and collaboration are key aspects of office culture. Financial considerations also influence both employers’ and employees’ perspectives on the office, but in different ways. 57% of employers in the Cisco study cited real-estate and building-maintenance expenses as the primary influencer of their organization’s preferred work model, while 40% of employees complained about commuting costs. Being in the office does more than boost metrics; it also nurtures connection, knowledge sharing and spontaneous learning. The Cisco study shows that 76% of respondents (and 85% of high performers) say office presence has accelerated their career progress. Additionally, 86% of employees and 81% of employers see regular attendance as critical for advancement, mentoring and inclusion. To offer a personal example, early in my career at a Hollywood studio, physical presence in a collaborative office was a valuable part of my learning — and gave me opportunities to seize unspoken opportunities. These experiences, which would have been difficult to find had I worked from home, occurred when “collaboration tools” meant a fax machine, a phone or email. While today’s immersive solutions can address some gaps, capturing the full career benefits of proximity now requires intentional, well-designed hybrid workflows, not haphazard adoption of new devices. As companies seek the right balance of RTO and hybrid and remote work, employers and employees must also remain vigilant about proximity bias. Proximity bias favors those who are physically present, often resulting in them receiving more opportunities, recognition and even protection from layoffs. One study from Beautiful.ai found that 60% of U.S. managers believed remote workers would be the first to be let go in a downturn. Left unchecked, proximity bias can create inequity, restrict knowledge transfer and marginalize remote contributors even when metrics suggest their performance is equal or greater. I wrote about the potential for this bias amidst Amazon’s RTO mandates in 2023, and it remains relevant. This is a cultural challenge, not just a management one. Workers, especially those early in their careers or aiming for advancement, must be mindful of how an intentional, strategic office presence can create opportunities, learning and recognition that are harder to cultivate from a distance. Perhaps more importantly, leaders must prioritize data-driven objective performance assessment over face time. As Francine Katsoudas, Cisco’s chief people, policy and purpose officer, said, “When we make the office about mentorship, connection [and] career development, people understand the value of being there. But when we focus solely on the work, it’s a less compelling value proposition.” Generational differences are a significant factor in shaping preferences about, and satisfaction with, hybrid work policies. According to Cisco’s study, employees from different generations report varying satisfaction levels with workplace arrangements, but flexibility is a consistent preference, especially among younger employees. Gen Z employees strongly prefer flexible work, expressing the greatest desire for autonomy over when and where they work. The report highlights that Gen Z employees rely heavily on collaboration technology and are most likely to expect workplace flexibility as a standard. Satisfaction with “fully flexible” arrangements is higher among younger generations, with Gen Z and Gen Y (millennials) reporting greater contentment under such policies compared to Gen X, who are the least likely to be “very satisfied” with flexibility, even though it remains their preferred model. Motivations to be in the office vary by generation as well. While most employees across generations recognize the importance of in-person work for career advancement and mentoring opportunities, younger employees are less satisfied with mandated full-time office attendance. For example, only 22% of Gen Z employees are satisfied with being required to work in the office full-time, whereas 38% of boomer employees report high satisfaction with this arrangement. Technology and well-being are again notable factors. Across the full employee base, nine out of ten (92%) employees rate collaboration and a sense of community as top reasons to value the office. Still, younger workers are more likely to expect advanced digital tools and wellness support as a part of their workplace experience. According to Cisco’s data, 90% of employees value collaboration tools, but only 32% of employers invest in high-grade technology that supports flexible, hybrid work models. This glaring gap between what employees want and what employers provide is where appropriate technology can make a real difference. Realizing this opportunity, tech companies are bringing out new products to close the gap between in-person and remote work. At the high end of the market, we see deluxe immersive tools like HP’s Dimension with Google Beam, which uses cutting-edge light field technology, spatial audio and multi-camera setups to create natural, lifelike remote meetings. At a somewhat more accessible price point, the Cisco Desk Pro — which I use in my home office and love — brings advanced video, smart framing and all-in-one collaboration tools to the hybrid desk, making virtual interactions smoother. The two examples just mentioned are high-end solutions, and widespread adoption of products like these will be constrained by expense and IT infrastructure demands. However, a range of more accessible tools can help to connect remote and hybrid workers at lower price points. For example, I use the iContact Camera Pro ($189) and the Elgato Prompter ($299). These tools are designed to facilitate direct eye contact, allowing me to look at my screen or read a script while still making eye contact with my audience on any platform — including Teams, Zoom or Webex. By positioning the camera or script in my line of sight, I can maintain this crucial connection while also picking up on people’s reactions and non-verbal cues. This is critical, as a recent study shows that eye contact in virtual communication is as important as in-person eye contact for conveying confidence, building rapport and fostering trust among colleagues and clients. Many device companies serving this market have also made significant strides in meeting-room technology, which can help remote participants feel more seen and heard regardless of which device they are using. Advanced systems now include AI-directed video framing that automatically zooms in on the current speaker or keeps the whole room in frame without manual adjustments. For example, Cisco Webex devices feature “cinematic meetings” experiences so that remote attendees get a clearer view of the conversation — which, in my view, helps with feeling included. Many collaboration platforms also prioritize high-quality audio with AI audio codecs that can reduce background noise and improve voice clarity even in challenging network conditions. Yet regardless of the device or price point, a gap remains in the investment that most companies are making in technology to support remote work for their rank-and-file employees. Finding the right blend of flexibility, inclusion and high performance remains a primary dilemma in the modern workplace. The best organizations won’t treat hybrid work as a binary choice. Instead, they will design purposeful systems that blend physical and digital environments, maximizing human connection and personal autonomy. In a briefing at this year’s Cisco Live event, Katsoudas emphasized, “It is more of a conversation that we need to have with our people around how they work and how they’re at their best.” However, implementing such a conversation in a big organization (Cisco, for instance, has 90,000 employees) is a significant challenge. Leaders must leverage technology and data to create a culture of feedback and trust that can scale beyond one-on-one discussions. Companies should also be careful not to mandate office attendance simply for the sake of following a single standard, as this risks losing access to a broader talent pool and could compromise diversity. Leaders must design in-office experiences that deliver unique value, such as in-person collaboration, mentorship and fostering a stronger connection to company culture — just not every day. At Cisco Live, Christian Bigsby, senior vice president of workplace resources at Cisco, emphasized the importance of designing flexible office spaces, using the phrase “more wheels, less walls” to describe the approach. He explained that instead of creating fixed, rigid environments, companies should design offices so spaces and furniture can be easily moved and reconfigured as needs change. By doing so, they can also counter the need for larger office spaces and leverage smart-workplace tech to optimize the space they do use. Hybrid work’s success will depend on connecting technology’s promise with thoughtful leadership and personal agency. This ensures the benefits of advancement, learning and engagement are accessible for all, wherever they work.

Title: Why Paramount’s $7.7 Billion UFC Gamble Will Pay Off
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/08/15/why-paramounts-77-billion-ufc-gamble-will-pay-off/

ByMatt Craig ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. In his first week as the new owner and CEO of Paramount Skydance, David Ellison has wasted no time differentiating himself from the previous ownership group. With a $1.5 billion dollar deal for South Park and a blockbuster $7.7 deal to land UFC for the next seven years, he has already committed billions in just his first week on the job, and may not be done writing big checks. But considering the company has struggled with profitability in recent years, recording an operating loss of $5.27 billion in 2024, it’s reasonable to wonder how Paramount plans to recoup the value for the $1.1 billion per year it will pay on average to the UFC, and whether in an effort to outbid competitors like Amazon and Netflix it paid too high a price. “On a standalone basis we struggle to see how Paramount earns back their investment,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note this week. “However, this deal does cement Paramount’s willingness to once again invest serious capital into the business in an effort to scale long-term.” Under the previous ownership of National Amusements, led by Shari Redstone, Paramount looked in recent years to shore up its balance sheet by selling or licensing some of its most valuable assets. In 2021, it sold the skyscraper that served as CBS’ New York headquarters for $760 million and later that year unloaded the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles for $1.85 billion. Two years later, Paramount sold the publishing company Simon & Schuster for $1.62 billion, and explored further sales for cable channel BET and streaming service Showtime that never materialized. Two of the company’s flagship shows, Yellowstone and South Park, were licensed to other streaming services for a cash influx. The 42-year-old Ellison—son of the world’s second richest person, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison—has already made it clear his intention to reverse that trend. On Wednesday, he told reporters that Paramount was no longer shopping BET and plans to keep the company’s assets intact for now. As he told the Wall Street Journal this week: “You can’t cut to grow.” Still, the money has to come from somewhere—other than the $290 billion net worth of his father. The younger Ellison has promised $2 billion in cuts, and significant layoffs are expected to occur before the end of the year. In the short-term it will be a tight squeeze, with the company’s streaming efforts being bankrolled by its linear broadcast channels. “Certainly for the first half of this [UFC] deal, CBS is paying for it,” says Patrick Crakes, a media analyst and former Fox Sports executive who worked closely with UFC during its time on the network. “Will it make a lot of money back? I don't know, but I don’t think that was the point. Paramount has increased its value with this deal by being viable. And this makes it more viable and important and must-see. So I would look for them to invest more in this area, not less.” Crakes knows firsthand what effects a deal like this can have on a network. In 1993 he had just been promoted out of the mail room at Fox, and was asked to load slides into the carousel for a presentation the network was making to the NFL, whose television rights were up for renegotiation. Fox eventually won the NFC package away from incumbent CBS by paying $400 million per year, seen at the time as vastly overpaying for football, considering CBS’ previous $265 million deal. During Crakes’ 23 years at Fox, he says he can only recall the NFL turning a direct accounting profit once. But because of the value and legitimacy the league brought to Rupert Murdoch’s then-nascent network, it was able to negotiate for better signal strength, channel position, and eventually build up a local station affiliate network that became enormously profitable for the company. While the UFC is clearly not on the level of the NFL, it does have a rabid fanbase that has proven it will follow the sport to new platforms. In his MoffettNathanson report, Fishman estimates that UFC could attract six million new subscribers to Paramount+, comparable to its first two years on ESPN+, with the potential for more because of the elimination of the pay-per-view model on its biggest events. Those numbers are a drop in the Octagon spit bucket compared to Paramount’s ultimate strategy, says Crakes. He, like nearly all media analysts, remains convinced that the current array of streaming services will eventually be bundled or consolidated into fewer digital offerings in the future. And that future is coming quickly. Just this week, ESPN and Fox announced a new streaming bundle, in the wake of the abandoned Venu Sports venture those two networks announced with Warner Bros. Discovery last year. By beefing up its content offerings, Paramount hopes to create a package that becomes not only indispensable for inclusion in future bundles, but also increases the share of revenue it can command. In other words, much like the cable bundles of 20 years ago, media companies are back to jockeying for carriage fees. Because live sports will drive most of that value, there’s almost no price too high to corner the market on an entire sport like MMA. Mark Shapiro, president and COO of UFC parent company TKO Holdings, says he has been hearing the rumblings that the sports rights bubble will burst since 2005 when he ran programming at ESPN, but has found eager bidders each time he has taken out rights packages. “The crash is just not there, it’s not true,” Shapiro tells Forbes. “You've got multiple platforms, varying strategies, linear and non-linear, they all need premium content and sports is the last bastion of unifying content.” With the addition of year-round UFC programming to Paramount’s strong seasonal sports offerings on CBS—including the NFL, The Masters and March Madness—plus entertainment brands like Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and the Star Trek universe, suddenly Paramount looks far more attractive as an acquisition or merger candidate. Or, given the backing of the Ellisons, Paramount could be the one doing the acquiring—especially given the makeup of Ellison’s new board of directors, which includes private equity veterans from RedBird Capital as well as Silver Lake’s Justin Hamill, who served for six years as the head of M&A at global law firm Latham & Watkins. “This is repositioning an old stodgy media brand into a tech-first, personalized content brand, one that could be an acquirer instead of a target,” says Chris Bevilacqua, a 30-year broadcast veteran and cofounder of Bevilacqua Helfant Ventures. “The question is, really, are they going to be one of those 4-5 services at the end of the movie?” That desire to compete against the biggest companies in the industry, and win, is one reason why UFC CEO Dana White was sold on getting Paramount in his corner. “They know exactly what they’re doing,” White told Forbes earlier this week. “The Ellisons are brilliant businessmen and they have a whole game plan behind this thing, so I love being in business with them for the next seven years."

Title: A laid-off Microsoft worker says his best career move was focusing on his side business instead of the corporate ladder

Eduardo Noriega spent over a decade preparing for the possibility that Microsoft would one day lay him off. When that day came, he was ready. In May, after 17 years with the company at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters, Noriega learned his role as a senior software engineer was being cut. He told Business Insider he's extremely grateful for his time at Microsoft. However, he started having concerns about job security amid the Great Recession when, less than a year into his role, the company announced plans to cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said the 51-year-old. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best shot at financial stability was building a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job at Microsoft. Rather than focusing solely on climbing the corporate ladder, he decided to continue working on a side business he'd started in Mexico. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made. "I decided not to put all my eggs in the career promotion basket, but to try to build something on my own," he said. "That's where I put a good deal of my eggs, and that's what paid off once I was laid off." Noriega is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who have been laid off in recent months. After cutting 6,000 jobs in May, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also included many individual contributor-level engineers like Noriega. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." Layoffs remain low by historical standards, but tech workers have been hit hard — just as white-collar hiring has slowed. That's made it more difficult for workers like Noriega to count on traditional employers for income. Instead, they may turn to working for themselves. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com or Signal at jzinkula.29. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: When Noriega started at Microsoft, he saw three potential career paths. One was to dedicate himself to the job and hope that promotions and raises would follow. Another was to jump between companies every few years, gradually landing more senior and higher-paying roles. The third was to build a side business with the goal of someday turning it into a full-time job. Noriega said his lifelong passion for entrepreneurship — along with a desire for a backup plan in case of a layoff — pulled him toward the third path. When he wasn't working at Microsoft, he dedicated time to a software education business that he'd begun developing before he moved to the US. After a few years, when the business didn't take off as he'd hoped, he shifted his focus to an online piano lessons venture — but that one also struggled to get off the ground. In 2016, he launched NTSprint, a staffing firm that helps Latin American software engineers access remote jobs in the US and Canada. Noriega, who is originally from Cuba and lived in Mexico for several years, said his goal was to help engineers in the region land higher-paying jobs and "break the cycle of poverty" in their communities. Over the past decade, Noriega has poured significant time and energy into building the business. In the year leading up to his Microsoft layoff, he said his typical schedule involved finishing work at 5 p.m., then exercising, showering, and eating dinner before working on NTSprint from 8 p.m. to midnight. In addition to those four-hour weeknights, he said he'd often spend up to eight hours on the business each Saturday and Sunday. "I was working like crazy," he said. Noriega said working on his business outside work hours was in compliance with Microsoft's moonlighting policy, which he said allows employees to pursue side projects or businesses as long as it's done outside company hours, the business doesn't compete with Microsoft, and company resources aren't used. Noriega said he was transparent about his business with his manager and didn't face any pushback. When Microsoft laid him off in May, Noriega said he'd already been talking with his wife about whether he should quit his job and focus exclusively on his business. He said he was earning more money from the business than from his Microsoft role, and the long hours were taking a toll. However, he said he couldn't bring himself to resign — doing so would mean giving up a steady paycheck, excellent health insurance, and unvested stock. Noriega said getting laid off by Microsoft was likely very difficult for most employees, but for him, it provided the push he needed to focus on his business full-time. He hasn't looked for another job since. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." Noriega said he thinks people who have concerns about their job security should consider diversifying their incomes — whether through freelancing, consulting, or building a business. He knows this isn't feasible for everyone, but said doing so helped him blunt the financial and career impacts of his layoff. In his final days at Microsoft, Noriega said a coworker told him he "won the Microsoft game." "What she meant is that I worked hard for the company, but once I was laid off, I was not left empty-handed and in despair, rushing to get the next job to support my family," he said. Jump to

U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels in a quiet finish to another winning week NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks edged back from their record levels on Friday in a quiet finish to another winning week. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% from the all-time high it set the day before, as it closed its fourth winning week in the last five. The Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with its own record, which was set in December, before ending just below the mark with a rise of 34 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.4%, though it’s still near its record set on Wednesday. The U.S. stock market reached all-time highs this past week as expectations built that the Federal Reserve will deliver a cut to interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. A disappointing report about inflation at the U.S. wholesale level made traders pare back bets for coming cuts to interest rates on Thursday, but they’re still overwhelmingly expecting them. Such anticipation has sent Treasury yields lower in the bond market, though they inched higher Friday following some mixed updates on the economy. One said shoppers boosted their spending at U.S. retailers last month, as economists expected, while another said that manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly grew. A third said industrial production across the country shrank last month, when economists were looking for modest growth. Another report suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is worsening because of worries about inflation, when economists expected to see a slight improvement. “Overall, consumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April,” when President Donald Trump announced his stunning set of worldwide tariffs, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan’s surveys of consumers. “However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.” On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group jumped 12% after famed investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it bought nearly 5 million shares of the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Buffett is known for trying to buy good stocks at affordable prices, and UnitedHealth’s halved for the year by the end of July because of a run of struggles. Berkshire Hathaway’s own stock slipped 0.4%. Applied Materials helped lead Wall Street lower with a decline of 14.1% even though it reported better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The focus was on the company’s forecast for a drop in revenue during the current quarter. Its products help manufacture semiconductors and advanced displays, and CEO Gary Dickerson pointed to a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment, which is creating increased uncertainty and lower visibility in the near term, including for our China business.” Sandisk fell 4.6% despite reporting a profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. Investors focused instead on the data storage company’s forecast for profit in the current quarter, which came up short of Wall Street’s. All told, the S&P 500 fell 18.74 points to 6,449.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 34.86 to 44,946.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 87.69 to 21,622.98. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose 0.8% in Shanghai but fell 1% in Hong Kong after data showed China’s economy may have slowed in July under pressure from uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7% after the government said its economy grew at a better-than-expected pace in the latest quarter. European stock indexes finished mixed before Trump began his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could dictate where the war in Ukraine is heading. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.31% from 4.29% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 3.75% from 3.74% late Thursday. ___ AP Writer Teresa Cerojano contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

US futures rose while oil prices slipped. China reported data showing its economy was feeling pressure from higher US tariffs in July, while property investments fell further. Retail sales rose 3.7 per cent year-on-year, down from 4.8 per cent in June, while investments in factory equipment and other fixed assets rose a meager 1.6 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent growth in January-June. Uncertainty over tariffs on exports to the United States is still looming over manufacturers after President Donald Trump extended a pause in sharp hikes in import duties for 90 days following a 90-day pause that began in May. The Shanghai Composite index added 0.5 per cent to 3,683.58, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.2 per cent to 25,216.45. “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support,” ING Economics said in a market commentary. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 1.2 per cent to 43,152.55 after the government reported that the economy grew at a 1 per cent annual pace in the April-June quarter. That was better than analysts had expected. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi edged less than 0.1 per cent higher to 3,225.66. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 8,909.20. Taiwan's TAIEX gained 0.3 per cent. Attention later Friday will likely focus on an update on US retail sales and on a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, seven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1 per cent to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell less than 0.1 per cent from its record set the day before. The inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3 per cent last month at the US wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5 per cent rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for US shoppers as higher costs make their way through the system. G-Secs rally on S&P’s rating upgrade for India The data led traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for US households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation. Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow.
