The technology industry, once a landing pad for fresh computer science graduates, is rapidly automating away its early-career talent pipeline. A.I. coding tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer now handle much of the entry-level work junior engineers once did, making it increasingly difficult for young professionals to break in.

You can opt out anytime. The impact isn’t limited to computer engineers. Earlier this month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei offered a stark prediction on 60 Minutes, reiterating his belief that A.I. could replace half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years and push unemployment as high as 10 to 20 percent. “If we look at entry-level consultants, lawyers, financial professionals—a lot of what they do, A.I. models are already quite good at,” he said. “It’s hard to imagine that there won’t be some significant job impact there.” Other A.I. and business leaders have echoed his concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of A.I.,” has argued that “for mundane intellectual labour, A.I. is just going to replace everybody.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said A.I. already performs “close to half” of the company’s workload. Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that “A.I. will leave a lot of white-collar people behind,” though he is more optimistic about blue-collar roles. He expects skilled workers in factories to become even more essential, as they provide “critically human support” in the context of automation. Several major studies support this trajectory. An August Goldman Sachs report warned that 6 to 7 percent of U.S. workers could lose jobs to A.I., particularly operational and support staff at large companies. Entry-level workers in tech remain the most affected, but hiring has also slowed in marketing, consulting, graphic design, office administration and call centers as businesses integrate new automation tools. A World Economic Forum study in January found that 41 percent of 1,000 surveyed global employers anticipate significant layoffs due to A.I. adoption. A recent Stanford study found that workers ages 22 to 25 in A.I.-exposed roles, especially in customer service and clerical work, have experienced a 13 percent decline in employment since 2022. In contrast, older workers in the same fields have had an easier time finding jobs. Other research suggests the downturn isn’t driven by A.I. alone. Negative perceptions of Gen Z employees and broader economic uncertainty are also factors. A study from Hult International Business School found that 89 percent of employers avoid hiring new college graduates, and 39 percent would prefer to use A.I. over hiring a Gen Z worker. Even so, companies are not uniformly shrinking their workforces. Some are restructuring instead—cutting traditional roles while adding new A.I.-specific ones. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said the bank’s overall headcount will continue to grow as it hires workers to support A.I. development, despite reductions in operational positions. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon voiced a similar view at an event in September, saying, “It’s very clear that A.I. is going to change literally every job.” Walmart, he said, will both eliminate and create roles, with the aim of helping employees “make it to the other side.” Ironically, while A.I. tools have increased the speed at which code can be generated, the durability of that code still depends on human expertise. A.I.-written code can be clumsy or brittle, and when complex systems break, engineers must know how to repair and refine them. Experienced engineers will still be needed to oversee A.I. systems, but even those roles could diminish, Amodei warned. “Eventually, all those little islands will get picked off by A.I. systems,” he said on 60 Minutes. “And then, we will eventually reach the point where the A.I.s can do everything that humans can. And I think that will happen in every industry.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: HP Joins List of Tech Companies Cutting Jobs and Pointing to AI

Reading time 3 minutes Computer maker HP is joining the growing list of companies that are conveniently announcing company-wide AI initiatives and plans to cut thousands of jobs at the same time. HP shared on Tuesday that it expects to scale artificial intelligence within the company and lay off about 4,000-6,000 employees by the end of 2028. With roughly 56,000 employees, that comes up to a 10% workforce reduction. âLooking forward, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate recent cost headwinds and are investing in AI-enabled initiatives to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity,” HP CFO Karen Parkhill said in the press release. Per the Guardian, the cuts will be centered around the product development, internal operations, and customer support teams. It’s safe to say that 2025 has so far been dominated by the question of whether or not AI is leading to mass unemployment. The job market is grim. Companies are cutting back on hiring new employees, while some are laying off hundreds to make investors happy in the next earnings report. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in September that although there is still great uncertainty, he believes that AI is “probably a factor” in the dramatic slowdown in hiring, particularly when it comes to young graduates who are facing a particularly concerning unemployment situation. There have been studies to back this phenomenon up as well. A Stanford study from August found that workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed jobs were hit hardest by a decline in employment. Many deem the jobs that are easiest to automate are those that would be done by young graduates. Experts have voiced concerns over the impact this will have on society as a whole, as less early career work would mean that the next generation of the workforce won’t receive crucial training. Even without the studies, companies have been openly and even proudly pointing the finger at AI as the reason why they are laying people off or just not hiring as much. Online learning platform Chegg laid off 45% of its workforce recently, citing “new realities of AI” as a factor. Amazon slashed 14,000 white-collar jobs, first seemingly pointing the finger at the “transformative technology” of AI before claiming days later that the cuts were not financially nor AI-driven. Many executives, like Shopify CEO Tobias LÃ¼tke and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn, have also been clear about their wish to reduce hiring in favor of automation. PwC global chairman told BBC last week that the company had scrapped plans it made in 2021 to hire 100,000 people by 2026, because “now we have artificial intelligence.” Still, though, some experts dispute that premise. âItâs much harder to implement AI in a firm than people realize,â Robert Seamans, New York University professor of management and organizations, told Gizmodo in August. âFirms donât typically have the in-house talent thatâs needed to train, operate, and oversee whatever AI they implement, and so until you have the personnel in place that have that expertise, itâs going to be really hard to rely heavily on AI.â An MIT report from August can back this up: corporate AI pilots are not as good as they seem at generating actual revenue gains. Seamans believes that at least some of these companies are actually using AI as a scapegoat for layoffs that stem from things like economic uncertainty or tariffs, which are “much harder to blame.” Meanwhile, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar called the “all-powerful-AI-taking-over-jobs” narrative a Silicon Valley “fundraising shtick,” in a recent conversation with the New York Times. Author Cory Doctorow, on the other hand, thinks that AI is unable to successfully replace many workers but bosses, and specifically tech bosses, “love the story” as a means to terrify workers into working more and complaining less (since, hypothetically, an AI chatbot could do all that work and not have to take breaks). “It gives them a chance to put them in their place,” Doctorow said in a talk last month.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nvidia CEO Says You’re “Insane” If You Don’t Use AI to Do Literally Everything

By Frank Landymore Published Nov 26, 2025 9:16 AM EST Don’t use AI to do literally everything? You might want to get your head checked, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. At least, that’s reportedly how Huang feels about any Luddite employees who are still writing code the old-fashioned way. Fortune reports that at an all-hands meeting last week, which took place right after the company reported its “blowout” third quarter results, Huang torched his managers who are still telling their teams to hold back on AI usage — an idea that, to him, should call your psychological wellbeing into question. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI,” Huang said. “Are you insane?” “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence,” he demanded. “I promise you, you will have work to do.” It’s a hard line for Huang to be taking, considering that there’s still no consensus on whether AI tools, especially in coding tasks, actually make workers more productive. In fact, a certain body of evidence points to the contrary: one study found that programmers who used coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude used less than half of the AI’s suggestions, rendering them 19 percent slower compared to their colleagues who didn’t harness AI’s awesome powers of automation. Nonetheless, tech companies are speedrunning the process of getting high on their own supplies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that as much as 25 percent of the company’s code is now AI-generated, and in June the company reportedly told staff that they were expected to use its Gemini model to write code going forward. The same story is playing out at Microsoft. CEO Satya Nadella similarly claims that over a quarter of the company’s code is written with AI, and as Fortune notes, echoed Google’s marching orders by telling its programmers this summer that using AI is “no longer optional.” Regardless of the quality of automation, the other big question is what does AI mean for programmers’ jobs? Tech layoffs have been brutal this year, with around 140,000 employees expected to be fired by year’s end. Amazon is in the middle of axing thousands of engineers as one of its top executives, in response to the harrowing reduction in personnel, gloats about how “transformative” AI is and the need to innovate. Huang, however, is telling employee with a straight face that embracing AI will be good for them — even as the leaders of companies that Nvidia is providing its Nvidia chips to, if not propping them up with billions of dollars of its own money, all warn that AI is, in fact, going to wipe out jobs. And so nevermind the widespread reports of AI chatbots literally causing people to be institutionalized — you’re the one who’s out of touch for refusing to fall in love with it.

Title: Job Claims Fall to Seven-Month Low as Employers Hold the Line on Layoffs

Despite plenty of headlines about layoffs, American companies are not letting go of many workers. Americans filed 216,000 new applications for unemployment benefits last week, down 6,000 from the prior week and marking the lowest level since mid-April, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The decline defied economists’ expectations for claims to rise to 225,000 and suggests companies remain reluctant to cut workers despite mounting economic headwinds and a string of high-profile layoff announcements. The number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment benefits edged up to 1.96 million for the week ended Nov. 15, hovering near levels last seen during the pandemic recovery. While initial filings remain relatively low by historical standards, the uptick in continuing claims points to a more challenging environment for job seekers trying to land new positions. The data paint a picture of a labor market in transition: Employers are pulling back sharply on hiring but haven’t yet resorted to widespread workforce reductions. Companies including HP, ConocoPhillips, General Motors, Paramount, Target, UPS, Verizon, and Amazon have announced plans to eliminate positions in recent weeks, though those cuts haven’t shown up meaningfully in unemployment statistics. The weekly claims figures can be volatile around holidays, and on an unadjusted basis, new applications jumped last week ahead of Thanksgiving. The four-week moving average, which smooths out such fluctuations, declined to 223,750. The labor market’s cooling has caught the attention of Federal Reserve officials, who cited employment concerns when cutting interest rates at their past two meetings. But policymakers are split on whether to deliver another rate reduction at their December gathering as they weigh persistent inflation against signs of labor-market softening. That uncertainty is filtering through to American workers. Consumer confidence dropped in November by the most in seven months, driven partly by dimmer views on employment prospects. A separate October survey found that 55 percent of employed Americans worry about losing their jobs, while nearly half believe it would take four months or longer to find comparable work if they were laid off. Continuing claims have trended higher since September, suggesting that while companies aren’t shedding workers en masse, those who do lose jobs are taking longer to find new ones, a shift from the rapid job-switching that characterized the pandemic-era labor market.

Title: This is the first year I can't find a holiday job
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kqw82j07o
Time Published: 2025-11-26T06:07:43Z

Nicholas Strahl has always been able to find extra work around the holidays. But this year has been the exception. Mr Strahl, 41, works as a part-time retail sales associate at an office supplies store just outside Indianapolis, Indiana. While the pay is "okay", he said it "never hurts to have a little bit more". Finding seasonal holiday employment, for extra cash to pay his bills and buy holiday gifts for friends and family, has been a challenge. He started his search in early October and applied to CVS, Best Buy and a slew of other retailers - to no avail. "I've never seen the job market like this - it's pretty crazy," he said. "It doesn't really leave a lot of power for people who just want to get a job, or have a supplement in income." Seasonal hiring is poised to drop to its lowest level since the aftermath of the 2008 recession, according to the National Retail Federation. The pullback, a sign of caution among US businesses in the face of tariffs and consumer angst, comes as more people are looking for work in the cooling job market. The industry group expects retailers to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from 442,000 last year. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which also predicted the weakest holiday season for retail hiring in more than 15 years, said tariffs, inflation and reliance on automation are dampening demand for seasonal hires. If Mr Strahl can't land a holiday job, he plans to cut down on holiday gifts and hold off on some car repairs. He will wait to replace his old laptop. "At this point," he said, "I'm willing to take anything I can get." Data from Indeed shows that while postings for seasonal work have largely held steady compared to last year, more people are seeking seasonal jobs. And in retail, traditionally one of the biggest hirers for the holidays, there are fewer opportunities. The labour market is "frozen with frostbite", said Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab. The fact that seasonal job postings have held steady from last year is reflective of the labour market's paralysis, she said. "You have a much bigger labour pool competing for a smaller number of jobs," she added. The government shutdown, which lasted more than one month before ending on 13 November, had delayed the release of official data on the labour market. But data for September, finally released last week, showed a surprising pick-up in hiring after a lacklustre summer. Employers added 119,000 jobs in September, more than double what many analysts had expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%. Data from Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence firm, shows job openings in the retail sector in October were down 22% from last year. The drop signals less demand among retailers for holiday workers. "We're just not seeing the usual pick-up in holiday hiring," said Lisa Simon, Revelio's chief economist. Several leading retailers, including Target and Walmart, have refrained from saying how many additional workers they will bring onto their payrolls for the holidays. Walmart may hire on a store-by-store basis, but extra hours during the holidays will mostly be given to current employees, a company spokesperson said. The lack of specificity marks a divergence from previous years, when the firms have announced their seasonal hiring plans in advance. In contrast, Amazon says it will hire the same number of people in its fulfilment and transportation network as it has over the past two years. "The cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge," Andy Challenger, senior vice president of sales at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. It follows recent high-profile layoffs at big US companies, including in the retail sector. Some smaller retailers are also treading carefully as they head into the holidays, further limiting options for job hunters to find roles at local shops. For Hobby Works, a chain of two toy stores in Maryland, pressure from tariff costs and whiplash on economic policy this year has been compounded in recent weeks by the federal government shutdown. Located just outside Washington, the company, which employs 24 people, pushed back its usual timeline for hiring seasonal workers, president Michael Brey said. Concern about a pullback in spending among government workers, who found themselves without pay for more than a month before the shutdown ended, encouraged the store to cut costs by scaling back hiring, he said. "Hanukkah always happens, Christmas always comes, so we try not to alter our hiring patterns too much," Mr Brey said. "But this is the first year we're moving very slowly." Two years ago, Tanya Secord sailed her way through the application process to land a temporary job at Target, where she worked as a part-time cashier during the 2023 holiday season. This year, her job hunt has been marred by disappointment after disappointment. Ms Secord, 52, sent her resume to retailers including Costco and Target, hoping her experience working in retail would help. But each application was met with either radio silence or a rejection. "It was incredibly stressful because the price of groceries has gone up, the cost of living in general is ridiculous," said Ms Secord, who finally landed a receptionist role in early November. Martin Connolly says he does not know how many lights are used in total on the display. The children are staying in hospital over Christmas but their designs will light up Leazes Park. Malcolm Molloy says he feels "guilty" but said he and his wife have "had a good 22 years". Festive film Nollaí - a tale of "love and belonging" - airs in both languages on 14 December. Suzanne Wiggins knows it is "only November" but wants people to respect her tribute to her late daughter. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: HP announces up to 6,000 job cuts as Apple trims sales roles in latest tech layoffs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/hp-announces-6000-layoffs-apple-cuts-sales-roles-10386557/

The tech layoff wave seems to have swept over hundreds of thousands of professionals this week, with big names like Apple and HP announcing major job cuts. HP Inc., on Tuesday, November 25, said that it is likely to cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs worldwide by 2028. The Palo Alto-based tech giant said that the move is in alignment with its larger plan to streamline operations and embrace AI to ramp up product development, boost productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. As part of the announcement, HP CEO Enrique Lores said that the company’s staff from teams working on product development, internal operations, and customer support will be impacted. The CEO spoke about the potential impact of layoffs during a media briefing. He added that the company expects to create about $1 billion in gross run rate savings over the next three years. Earlier this year, HP sacked over 2,000 of its workforce as part of its previously announced restructuring plan. Similarly, on Tuesday, it was reported that Apple Inc. eliminated dozens of sales roles to streamline its product offerings for businesses, schools, and government agencies. Reportedly, the latest round of layoffs at Apple impacted account managers and staff responsible for handling Apple’s briefing centres for institutional meetings and product demos. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone maker confirmed its reshuffling, asserting that it is making changes to connect more with customers. The company also said that the affected employees can apply for new roles within Apple. Reportedly, Apple notified the affected workers over the past few weeks. The job cuts impacted across the sales organisation, with some teams being hit severely. However, Apple has refrained from divulging the actual number of employees impacted. The latest job cuts come weeks after the tech giant slashed about 20 roles in its teams based in Australia and New Zealand. The latest development comes at a time when Apple’s revenue has been on the rise and it is set to make sales worth $140 billion in the December quarter. In October, it was reported that Apple topped $4 trillion in market value for the first time, making it the third big tech company to hit the milestone. While internally, it has been reported that Apple is viewing these layoffs as part of its vision to streamline its sales teams and reduce the overlapping of roles. However, some reports also suggest that the move is likely an effort to transfer more of its sales to third-party resellers, which Apple terms as ‘channels’. Companies often opt for indirect sellers to reduce internal costs like salaries. It needs to be noted that unlike other tech giants, Apple views layoffs as a ‘last resort’ and is seldom seen announcing massive job cuts compared to Google, Amazon, or Meta. According to layoff.fyi, the month of October saw 21 companies lay off as many as 18,510 employees, with companies like Amazon announcing that it was planning to lay off over 14,000 corporate workers with its burgeoning investments in AI. The e-commerce giant said that it is cutting jobs to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic as it looks at boosting its investments in AI. This would be the biggest corporate job cuts in the history of Amazon. Meanwhile, in November, 20 tech companies have so far laid off 4,545 employees. The biggest layoffs this month were carried out by chip-design software maker Synopsys, which laid off about 2,000 of its employees, constituting nearly 10 per cent of its workforce. A regulatory filing revealed that the company trimmed its workforce in an effort to redirect its investments towards growth opportunities. This year so far 1,114,124 employees have been handed over the pink slip by 237 tech companies. A massive fire is ravaging a residential block in Hong Kong's Tai Po district. So far, the fire is known to have claimed at least 44 lives. The fire broke out at the Wang Fuk Court complex on Wednesday. The complex had been under renovation for a year. The exact cause of the fire is being probed, but locals said they often found cigarette butts outside their sealed windows before the tragedy.

PHOTO: HP/FACEBOOK Published Nov 26, 2025, 08:45 AM Updated Nov 26, 2025, 07:08 PM San Francisco – Computer and printer-maker HP announced on Nov 25 a sweeping restructuring plan that will eliminate about 10 per cent of its workforce globally, as the company pivots towards arti­ficial intelligence (AI) to boost efficiency. According to its latest earnings report, the tech giant expects to reduce­ its global headcount by between 4,000 and 6,000 employees to focus on adopting AI to increase innovation and customer satisfaction. In response to The Straits Times’ queries on Singapore layoffs, HP Singapore declined to comment. HP’s move reflects a growing trend across the tech sector, where companies are investing heavily in AI development while using the technology to reduce operational costs. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have announced workforce reductions over the past two years, with many citing the need to reallocate resources, including jobs, towards AI initiatives. Industry analysts say AI automation is particularly affecting roles in customer support, content moderation, data entry and certain computer programming tasks. HP said its AI plan aims to generate approximately US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2028. The company has been working to transform its business model amid changing demand patterns in the PC and printing markets. HP chief executive Enrique Lores told The Wall Street Journal that the company plans to raise the prices of its computers and work with new suppliers to help offset the higher costs of AI computing. In its latest quarter, HP posted a profit of US$795 million, compared with US$906 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.2 per cent to US$14.64 billion, topping analyst estimates with sales in PCs offsetting a decline in printer sales. Since opening its first factory in Singapore in 1970, HP’s presence in the Republic has evolved into a strategic innovation hub, with research and development across print, personal systems and smart manufacturing applications. It was last reported in September 2021 that HP Singapore employed more than 3,000 people. Its current Singapore headcount was not disclosed.

Title: Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance

UPDATED 18:51 EST / NOVEMBER 25 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the personal computer makers Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. were heading in opposite directions in the after-hours market today after offering contrasting guidance for the next three months. In the case of Dell, which is still led by its namesake founder Michael Dell (pictured) investors looked bullish after the company forecast stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue thanks to what it said is strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. HP, on the other hand, offered a forecast that came in below Wall Street’s estimates and said it’s planning to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 people over the next two years, accounting for up to 10% of its total workforce. Dell’s results in the quarter just gone weren’t great, as they missed the Street’s targets on revenue. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.59 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.47. But it could only deliver revenue of $27.01 billion, up 11% from a year ago but shy of the $27.13 billion estimate. All told, Dell delivered $1.54 billion in net income, rising from $1.17 billion in the same quarter last year. For the current quarter, things are looking better, though, as Dell is expecting about $31.5 billion in total sales at the midpoint of its forecast range, well ahead of the Street’s $27.59 billion target. The company is also forecasting healthy earnings of around $3.50 per share, surpassing the $3.21 forecast. AI is the primary reason for Dell’s bullish forecast. The company said it’s raising its overall revenue forecast for AI server shipments to $25 billion, up from an earlier forecast of just $20 billion. It also boosted its full-year revenue target to $111.7 billion, up from $107 billion. Wall Street reacted positively to the report, with Dell’s stock gaining more than 3% in after-hours trading. Dell has in fact become a major bellwether for the AI infrastructure market and its overall health, as it’s one of the top manufacturers of server systems featuring Nvidia Corp.’s powerful graphics processing units. Most of its customers are large enterprises, government agencies and so-called “neocloud” providers such as CoreWeave Inc. It sells fewer servers to the big cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC, also known as “hyperscalers,” which often buy GPUs directly from Nvidia. Still, there’s an enormous market for Dell’s servers, and it said it’s expecting to ship about $9.4 billion worth in the current quarter. But that doesn’t include a recent deal it announced that will see it ship Nvidia GB300-based systems to a neocloud company called Iren Ltd., which subsequently plans to rent their capacity to Microsoft Corp. Dell’s server business is part of its broader Infrastructure Solutions Group, which delivered $14.11 billion in sales during the previous quarter, in-line with the Street’s expectations. Within that segment, server sales and networking parts generated $10.1 billion in sales, up 37% on an annual basis, with $5.6 billion spent on AI servers. The company also sold $4 billion worth of storage systems during the quarter. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “Dell is winning in AI because of our unique ability to engineer bespoke high-performance solutions, rapidly deploy large, complex clusters, and provide global support.” Dell’s other main business is, of course, PCs and laptops. They fall in the company’s Client Solutions Group, which reported revenue of $12.48 billion in the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier but trailing the Street’s forecast of $12.65 billion. Clarke said on a conference call with analysts that the company expects PC and laptop sales to get a boost from Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows 10 last month. Many enterprises have only just started refreshing their portfolios as they scramble to upgrade to Windows 11. “Dell is riding the AI wave with its server business growing by an impressive rate,” said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research. “Servers and networking are now poised to overtake the company’s once-biggest revenue stream, namely PCs. That’s because of AI. The company is on the rise, and investors were pleased to see its profitability grow along with its revenue.” As for HP, the main focus of investors wasn’t its results, but rather its glum forecast and the fact that the company intends to lay off so many thousands of workers. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 93 cents per share on sales of $14.64 billion, edging past the Street’s targets of 92 cents and $14.48 billion in revenue, respectively. Despite the results, HP’s revenue only gained 4% from a year earlier, while net income rose slightly to $795 million in the quarter, from $763 million one year ago. The PC and printer maker’s snail’s pace revenue growth was a concern, and equally alarming for investors was the forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. HP said it’s looking for earnings of between 73 cents and 81 cents per share, short of the consensus estimate of 79 cents. For the full year, the company sees earnings at between $2.90 and $3.20 per share, trailing the analyst’s target of $3.33. The company didn’t issue any revenue guidance. In a statement, HP said its outlook reflects the additional costs that stem from current U.S. trade-related regulations and “associated mitigations” implemented by the company. HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores (pictured below) tried to put a brave face on what is a very glum picture, saying the results reinforce the power of its portfolio and the strength of the company’s teams. However, investors and analysts were much more interested in hearing about the reasons behind the company’s decision to lay off so many staff. Lores said he expects the headcount reduction to be completed by the end of the company’s fiscal 2028 year – two years from now, so it’s going to be a relatively slow process. It will help the company to realize savings of at least $1 billion in its annualized gross run rate by that time. However, it will incur approximately $650 million in charges, with a $250 million hit expected in fiscal 2026. Lores said the restructuring plan is part of an initiative that will see the company adopt more AI automation to try to accelerate product and software development. It’s planning to automate some customer support services, as well as many of its internal business processes. “We really think this is a unique opportunity we cannot miss to really continue to transform the company and continue to be competitive for the next 10, 20 years,” he told analysts on a call. “I think any work is going to be impacted by AI, and we need to take advantage of it as a company.” The layoffs come at a time when HP is facing significantly higher costs in its PC business, thanks to surging demand for chips in the AI data center industry driving up the price of memory chips. “Memory costs are currently 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,” Lores said. To counter this, Lores said the company will increase the price of many of its PCs and laptops and work with some lower-cost suppliers on ways to reduce the memory configuration of their products to offset some of these costs. However, the company still expects to see a net headwind of abut 30 cents per share in the current fiscal year, Lores said. “It is a very significant number, and this is net of all the actions that we are already putting in place,” he added. However, the company’s efforts weren’t enough to satisfy investors, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading. During the previous quarter, HP’s personal systems unit, which covers laptops and desktop PCs, delivered $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above the analyst forecast of $10.15 billion. Lores said on the call that the company expects to see sales improve following the end of support for Windows 10, explaining that this will prompt a lot of businesses to upgrade and buy new PCs. Currently, only about 60% of HP’s installed base has moved to Windows 11, the CEO pointed out. HP’s other main business is printers, which delivered $4.3 billion in sales during the quarter, down 4% from a year ago and just below the Street’s forecast. The company explained that it’s dealing with a competitive pricing environment that has put off a lot of customers from purchasing new models. Mueller told SiliconANGLE that the biggest problem for HP is that it only has two main business lines — PCs and printers, unlike Dell, which has its fast-growing data center infrastructure business. “The reliance on these two markets means HP is very exposed to supply chain shifts, and it’s currently dealing with much higher memory chip prices,” the analyst said. “However, that’s also true for its rivals and so HP needs to do better. It’ll need to convince customers that its PCs are worth paying a bit more for, or else reduce its cost base somewhere else. Investors will also be interested to see how the company’s automation efforts will make up for the reduction in full-time employees.” As of Tuesday’s market close, HP’s stock is now down 27% in the year to date, while Dell is up 7% over the same timeframe. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 15% this year. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

Title: Apple Sales Layoffs Hit Dozens Despite Record Revenue

The company frames the move as restructuring rather than financial trouble, potentially signaling a shift toward third-party resellers and new strategic priorities. When business is good, companies tend to hire more people in order to meet the demand. However, when business is bad or slow, that’s when companies conduct layoffs. But are things going badly at Apple, so much so that the company is conducting layoffs across different sales roles? That’s what’s allegedly happening, according to a report from Bloomberg. According to the report, Apple has eliminated roles primarily within its enterprise sales division. The affected positions include account managers handling corporate, education, and government clients. It also includes employees at Apple’s briefing centers, where the company hosts high-level product demonstrations for major customers. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as Apple doing badly. Instead, Apple frames these layoffs at its sales division as a restructuring to streamline operations and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. The company says it’s still hiring in other areas and has encouraged affected staff to apply for open internal positions. Some employees have been given deadlines to find new roles within Apple before receiving their severance packages. According to some affected employees, they believe the company is shifting more enterprise business to third-party resellers. This means potentially reduced salary and support costs. The government sales team appears to be hit particularly hard. The division was already struggling with federal budget constraints and a prolonged US government shutdown that slowed the closing of deals. Apple has built a reputation for treating layoffs as an absolute last resort. While competitors spent 2023 and 2024 cutting thousands of positions, Apple largely avoided massive workforce reductions. This is versus other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies slashed thousands of jobs during recent downturns. What makes these Apple sales layoffs interesting and kind of weird is the timing. The company recently reported approximately $140 billion in revenue for the December quarter. Like we said, companies tend to cut jobs when things are bad. But cutting jobs during strong financial performance sends a different message. Perhaps this is Apple’s way of diverting its resources to other investments, like in AI, where it appears to be currently struggling. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Can artificial Christmas tree companies spruce things up for next year?

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. No one wants to put tariffs on Christmas, says the National Tree Company CEO. But what happens when all of your raw materials are made outside of the U.S.? If you celebrate Christmas, there’s a good chance you are putting up a tree this year. There’s also a high probability that you are rockin’ around a fake tree. Convenience, safety, durability and cost-effectiveness contribute to 83% of households selecting an artificial tree for the season, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. And the U.S., as it turns out, has a much heavier artificial tree representation than most of the world. “About 15 to 20 million are bought every single year,” National Tree Company CEO Chris Butler said. “It’s a huge industry.” This segment of the holiday market has been impacted by a year of roller coaster tariffs, retail pullback and an uncertain consumer base. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about, ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas,’” Butler said. But, as he points out, “Zero percent of our industry is made in the U.S.” Holiday-focused companies are responding by moving production to different countries, implementing price changes, conducting promotions when possible and advocating to the government. Not just for 2025, but for Christmas seasons yet to come. The National Tree Company knows trees. Specifically, artificial ones. As one of the largest domestic wholesalers of the product, shoppers can buy directly from the company’s website, but also through large retailers including Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Macy’s and Lowe’s. As far as artificial tree consumption goes, the U.S. sports an average of one and a half trees per household, with the average purchase cycle being between five and six years. And all of the raw materials to make those trees come from China. The National Tree Company started to move its production out of China about 18 months ago for diversity and flexibility of its supply chain. The company currently sources from parts of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam, resulting in around 60% of its goods coming from outside of China this year. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas.’” Chris Butler CEO, National Tree Company So when tariffs were announced this spring, the company was expecting it, but they weren’t expecting the tariffs to be so heavy on countries other than China. “It was a bit of a shock to the system all the way around, because we were looking at 50% tariffs across the board, pretty much going from zero,” Butler said. When tariffs on China reached 145% this spring, almost all artificial tree production across this segment of the industry stopped for about 30 days. When levies on China were reduced, production started up again, but at a lower rate, Butler said. Additionally, many companies started building their supply chain sites outside of China at the same time. “It’s not difficult to set up a new factory in different countries, but once you do that, you still need the raw materials from China,” Butler said. “There was a slowing down of the supply chain this year, and hence why we think there’ll be somewhat of a shortage of supply.” The National Tree Company was able to be flexible when tariffs went back to 30%, in part because the business had been steadily investing in its supply chain systems. Even still, it was “100% by far the most challenging year ever,” Butler said. There may be better news going into 2026, however, when it comes to supply chains and tariffs. “I think it will start to stabilize,” Lauren Beitelspacher, professor of marketing at Babson College, said in emailed comments. Yet, “retail is always fraught with disruption,” Beitelspacher said. “The ups and downs are normal.” The big unknown for specialty retailers and big-box stores alike this year has been consumer sentiment. Tariffs, inflation, layoffs and a sudden suspension of SNAP funding have all contributed to an unsteady foundation for many holiday shoppers. Stores weren’t exactly sure how to gauge inventory for the season. Over half of holiday orders were placed by the end of May, about two months earlier when compared to 2024, according to Deloitte’s 2025 Retail Holiday Buyer Survey. Retail buyers paused shipments of some orders due to the trade environment or even canceled orders they determined would be unprofitable. The National Tree Company saw retailers “fall back somewhat because they were unsure of the consumer demand and consumer sentiment for this holiday season,” Butler said. Holiday shortages loomed over this Christmas season even as early as July, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. A 90-day reprieve in tariffs during the summer didn’t solve problems, according to the nonprofit group, because most Christmas decor items, including trees, lights, ornaments and garlands, are manufactured overseas with long production lead times. Now that retailers are in the throes of the season, some shoppers are pulling back on purchasing those exact items. Nearly 30% of people in the U.S. are decreasing their decorating budgets this year, according to a survey from Rocket Mortgage and Redfin. More than half (56%) of the segment that is pulling back say it is because they are trying to save money, while 44% named economic uncertainty as the reason behind the change. But there are still deals out there to be had. “If you’re in the market for a tree, buy now, buy early, buy multiple,” Butler said. “Despite the price increase from the tariffs, there are absolutely going to be deals. Because us — as well as everybody else — is seeing softness in demand. So there’s definitely going to be deals.” Butler also leads the Christmas Trade Group, a 10-member organization that collectively brings in over $1 billion annually and represents over 1,000 employees. He recently was in Washington, D.C., meeting with the Senate Finance Committee as a way to provide education on their businesses and garner insights into tariffs going forward. “2025 is done,” Butler said. “So what we’re trying to do is ‘save Christmas’ for 2026. Both from a supply chain perspective, in terms of securing supply in the right areas, as well as from a cost perspective, to keep the costs lower.” “We want to maintain the affordability of the holiday,” he said.

Title: Amazon CTO Werner Vogels just released his 2026 tech predictions. He’s most optimistic about ‘personalized learning’ and ‘renaissance developers’

Good morning. Several years ago, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels began sharing predictions on how technology would likely impact our lives the following year. In the past, he has foreseen the impact of digital technology in sports, AI assistants in developer productivity, machine learning embedded in production lines, and ‘fem tech’ in women’s health. As CTO since 2005, he occupies a unique perch to see—and even shape—what’s next. He also has a vested interest, of course, in embracing the technologies that his company creates. But these predictions are worth taking note of as these trends—if they materialize—will affect wide swaths of the economy. So what’s he forecasting for 2026? I spoke with Vogels about the thinking behind this year’s predictions. Among other things, he admits that technology tools from AI to military drones can obviously harm or help, depending on the intention of the user. But he’s an optimist, especially about the potential for personalized learning and software developers. And how does he see the mission of the CTO—a role that can cover everything from being the person who manages data centers to the founder focused on product? “I actually think CTOs are horrible managers. You should never put a CTO in charge of people,” he argues. “VPs of engineering wake up in the morning, thinking ‘Do I have the best team in the best situation? Can I shield them from politics and stuff like that?’ The CTO thinks about, ‘What’s the next technology that we should be building?’ Actually, that was my role for many years within Amazon. Then you become a technology provider, and then your role changes again. You have to understand how your customers are actually using your technology.” As for what excites him most: “Especially in Africa, I’ve met so many motivated engineers that don’t want to come to the U.S. They don’t want to go work for a large company. They want to solve the problem in their country. I love that. That’s where the real progress lies.” Click here for our full interview.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Google challenges Nvidia’s chips Shares of Nvidia dropped following a report that Meta is in talks to buy billions worth of AI chips from Google, suggesting the search engine company’s chips are ready to compete with Nvidia’s bestselling versions.

Tim Cook’s possible successors Since Apple CEO Tim Cook turned 65 recently , speculation has intensified about his possible successors.

The Big Short investor compares Nvidia with Cisco The Big Short investor Michael Burry wrote in his first Substack post that Nvidia is the equivalent of Cisco during the dot com bubble: significantly overvalued and a harbinger for when the AI bubble will pop. Novo Nordisk’s slump continues U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk fell more than 5% on Monday, largely due to the drug developer’s announcement that semaglutide, the core ingredient in its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, did not slow cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s patients. The company has lost almost half of its value since the year started. Is robot-driven unemployment already here? Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October, and multiple sources now predict another round of layoffs in early 2026 as the company doubles down on AI and robotics.

Title: India shouldn’t build AI models: The prize lies in using what exists to innovate and generate value

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it was eliminating 14,000 management positions because artificial intelligence (AI) tools had rendered those middle-management roles redundant. Amazon isn’t the only one—Microsoft, Google and IBM have all announced AI-related layoffs. According to a 2023 report by Niti Aayog, 1.5 million Indian jobs in the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors alone are expected to be at high risk by 2031. McKinsey believes that as many as 69% of tasks in India’s IT services industry can already be automated with existing AI technology, suggesting that as many as 3-4 million jobs in the IT and BPO sectors could be at risk in the near to medium term. Our instinctive response has been to try to catch up—to build AI capabilities so that we can replace the jobs being lost by upskilling displaced workers with the technology that displaced them. We have announced AI education initiatives, established new AI research centres and funded GPU clusters and data centres that we believe these newly trained engineers will be able to use for building AI applications. But this strategy is unlikely to be effective. Firstly, India will not be able to bridge the skills gap by simply retraining its existing workforce. Unlike the IT industry, which has a broad base, AI has an inverted pyramid and is staffed in exactly the opposite way that a BPO centre is staffed. As a result, even if we manage to reskill all those in the traditional IT industry, only a small fraction of those reskilled IT workers will be needed going forward. What’s more, unlike the US, which boasts of 30 years of AI research infrastructure and top universities that attract global talent, and China, which is investing billions in AI research and already has a massive pool of strong STEM graduates, India currently produces fewer than 500 AI PhDs annually. Even if we increase this 10-fold, we will still be playing catch-up in a field where first-mover advantages matter enormously. The trouble with competing in the race to build better AI models is that it requires us to compete upstream in the AI value chain in a market already crowded by players with significantly more capital and hardware infrastructure, which places them ahead in the game. As noble as it might seem for us to fight the good fight, there are other areas in which Indian investments in time and resources are likely to yield better results. When the automobile disrupted traditional urban mobility and transport dynamics, the real opportunity was not in making cars, but in the novel ways in which they could be used for business and the new liberties that arose from being able to use these machines for things that were not possible earlier. When Apple invented the smartphone, it did not just create a revolutionary communication device, but also made it possible for brand new businesses (such as ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments) to emerge. Every technological transformation creates ripples of opportunity downstream that offer new avenues for entrepreneurship. This suggests that the AI opportunity lies not in competing with big AI labs to build better models, but rather in discovering all the various ways in which AI can be deployed to create value. This, in turn, suggests that instead of competing with countries that are at the cutting edge of developing new foundational AI models, India may be far better off figuring out how to use AI to do things that would not have been possible previously. One of the clearest signs of this downstream potential is how dramatically AI has already lowered barriers to creative endeavours. Already, to write a story or create an image, a musical composition or a software feature, all you need to do is describe what you want and AI will execute it. Even just a few years ago, filmmaking required large crews, expensive equipment and a budget that ran into millions. AI has made it possible to create visual effects, voice actors and music scores, with film editing done and other technical skills deployed at a fraction of that cost. Similarly, music production used to require studio recording, mixing and mastering skills. Today, with AI, almost anyone can generate a score, create vocal effects and mix tracks. Just as the world saw in the case of every other technological transformation that created new jobs and industries downstream of the actual disruption it caused, AI too will birth business opportunities that are not even conceivable today. If we really want to address the disruptions that AI will cause in the job market, we should focus our energies on enabling as many of our people as possible to figure out how to use AI and do all we can to make it possible for our young entrepreneurs to leverage this new technology in as many new and interesting ways as they can imagine. The next three to five years will be a period of intense experimentation, when AI-assisted business models will be tested, refined and scaled. India’s entrepreneurs have a rare early-mover advantage—not in building the models themselves, but in discovering what those models make possible. If we invest our energy downstream, in imagining the new possibilities that are opening up, we will be able to harness the real opportunity that AI offers. Our best response to the AI revolution is not to build better intelligence, but discover the many ways in which it can be put to use. India needs to make the most of this opportunity.

Title: Nvidia CEO told employees to use AI for 'every task that is possible' and says there will still be plenty of jobs

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?" Huang said he strongly disapproved. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do." Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday. Have a tip?

Title: Gen Z Redefines Work as Flexible Pay Gains Ground

With inflation and changing government policies prompting widespread uncertainty, 6 in 10 American workers are facing pocketbook challenges while lacking the steadiness and predictability of a salaried job.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ The latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series, breaks down how consumers earn income. The study is based on a census-balanced survey of 2,117 U.S. adult consumers, 62% are employed. Among those workers, 43% say their primary source of income is an hourly wage, and another 15% say it is from other non-salaried pay models such as gig work or contract fees. Gen Z workers especially are working outside of fixed-salary roles. Nearly 3 in 4 get their income in other ways, with 51% earning hourly wages, 9% earning contract or consulting fees, 7% earning income from gig or platform work and 5% earning commission-based pay. More Americans are relying on part-time jobs to make ends meet. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employees working full-time dropped by 0.5%, or 695,000 people, between 2023 and 2024. The number of part-time workers jumped 3.7%, or just over 1 million people, during the same period. Relatedly, the rise in gig work can be seen in the expansion of major platforms catering to independent contractors and freelancers. In the third quarter of 2025, Uber said it had 9.4 million drivers, up from 7.8 million the year before and 7.4 million in the second quarter of last year. DoorDash grew total orders by 21% year over year in Q3 to 776 million. Lyft reported record-high gross bookings of $4.8 billion in the third quarter, a 16% year-on-year spike. Even companies outside the dedicated gig platform space, such as UPS, are using the gig model. But as more consumers rely on hourly, project-based and gig work to make ends meet, rather than the stability of a fixed salary, they may find it harder to weather an uncertain economic environment. Because of the Trump administration’s global “reciprocal” tariffs regime, Americans face the highest import levies in 90 years. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Recent PYMNTS data shows confidence slipping, especially among lower-income workers. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, often described as a pessimist, sees the threat of a U.S. recession continuing to loom as the new year approaches. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including 42% who see their money fly out the door the month it comes in, an 18% jump since August. It is not as if these workers can simply leave their jobs for more steady, reliable work, with the number of job openings unchanged at 7.2 million in August. What’s more, many of the skilled jobs that often come with fixed salaries are shrinking. While economists are sharply divided over the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs, some recent research suggests that white collar roles — those traditional salaried positions — will be most impacted. While some businesses tout how AI will enable them to introduce operational efficiencies and reduce their workforces, companies also downsize for reasons not related to the technology. October saw a 175% year-over-year increase in layoffs, with Amazon planning to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs and Target slashing its corporate roles by 1,800. Workers have been nervous about these reductions for some time. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey last year found that 58% of consumers believed generative AI posed a risk to high-skilled jobs in tech. More than half deemed it a risk to mainstream office-based occupations, and 52% said it jeopardized roles for qualified education workers. As go changes in the labor market, so go spending and consumption patterns, deepening the connection between income instability and personal financial well-being.

More from the series → After months of testimony and a final day of unusually pointed questioning, Judge Leonie Brinkema used the closing arguments phase of the U.S. Department of Justice v. Google to give the clearest indication yet of how she is weighing up an appropriate remedy after ruling the defendant a monopolist earlier this year. After Friday’s proceedings, she has now retired to her chambers to mull over a decision over the coming weeks, but for many, a complete divestiture of Google’s ad exchange or ad server (i.e., the entity formerly known as DoubleClick For Publishers within Google Ad Manager) appears increasingly unlikely. During closing arguments, the judge repeatedly steered the discussion away from theory and toward hard practicalities, indicating that pragmatism, more than pure ideals, will (likely) drive the final outcome. This is because Brinkema’s questions consistently pressed the DOJ on implementation timelines, commercial feasibility, and the (what many courtroom attendees perceived as) a lack of concrete detail in its structural remedy plan. “Time is of the essence,” she said at one point, citing the rapid pace of technological change in advertising and AI. Any remedy, she stressed, must be “concrete” and must account for the “commercial reality” of execution. That framing dominated the morning. While DOJ attorney Matthew Huppert reiterated the government’s preference for a structural remedy — divesting AdX, open-sourcing auction logic, or potentially forcing a sale of GAM — he conceded DOJ was “not dogmatic about the details.” But when pressed on specifics, including whether a structural remedy could be implemented during an inevitable appeal, the DOJ offered little. Judge Brinkema, noted that behavioral remedies “could go forward whether there is an appeal pending or not,.” She added, “[Divestiture] is a dramatic change,… [it] would most likely not be as easily enforceable while an appeal was pending.” Google’s Karen Dunn capitalized on that hesitation. Dunn argued the DOJ “did not meet the heavy burden required for a divestiture,” arguing that witnesses for the defense asserted that Google’s proposed remedies would address their concerns. She further outlined Google’s opinion that the DOJ failed to prove behavioral remedies were insufficient; that a technically and commercially workable buyer existed; and that divestiture would restore competition or avoid harms to consumers. During rebuttal, DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood conceded that a buyer has not been identified –although Digiday sources have relayed how loose-lipped attendees at this year’s Advertising Week New York voiced their intentions to take a look at the DFP – while the defendant argued a sale would be “messy, risky and long, with no guarantee of success.” What the ruling will likely look like Taken together, Brinkema’s questions point to a strong likelihood that she will opt against ordering a divestiture — at least not immediately. Her emphasis on timelines, enforceability during appeal, technical feasibility and the need to avoid abstract reasoning suggests she is leaning toward a behavioral-first remedy, potentially supplemented with guardrails or phased requirements. A ruling is expected “likely next year,” she said — most likely in Q1 or Q2 of 2026, based on her remarks. Settlement? Appeal? Hw long will this drag on? Brinkema remarked that she “could see a settlement” that makes sense, though she acknowledged the widening gap between the parties and the existence of “looming settlements” in other ad-tech cases. Realistically, the chance of an agreed resolution appears low. An appeal, however, appears inevitable. Google has signaled as much, and Brinkema repeatedly referenced the complications of crafting remedies that must survive scrutiny. A full appellate cycle could take 18–30 months, pushing any structural remedy (if ordered) well into 2028. In other words, the case may be nearing its first final judgment, but the industry is only entering the next chapter. “We’re entering an odd moment in AI where a huge number of “AI companies” are basically wrappers on top of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or open models like Mistral and Qwen. They don’t own the tech, the data, or the infrastructure — yet they’re being valued as if they do.” – One Digiday source casts a healthy dose of cynicism among the AI hype-cycle Sources suggest Amazon’s latest round of mass layoffs cut headcount in its advertising division by up to 20%, though staff there are paid through the last week of January, making it difficult to establish exact numbers. A new pitch deck making the rounds at agencies drives that point home. Google boss Sunar Pichai warns ‘no company immune’ to AI bubble bursts The most powerful chief executive in the industry says the quiet part out loud. The EU considers cracking down on Big Tech’s cloud power Cloud infrastructure is increasingly part of the consideration of advertisers and their supply chain, and that’s not lost on regulators. Advertisers see now value in news, but Google knows society will pay Richard Gingras, Google’s longtime news policy lead, he continues to push back on the Google-owned web argument, in conversation with Ricky Sutton and Alan Chapell. Yahoo is testing 6 AI agents for advertising, leaked slides show Yahoo hopes to capitalize weariness over Google’s market leadership and the escalating standoff between Amazon and The Trade Desk to further its marketshare of its demand-side platform. The world’s largest agency holding company is born. But there may come a day soon where it can no longer be called an agency, but rather a broker and re-seller. Agencies, ad-tech companies and publishers are racing to test AI media agents. Not all those tests are successful — even some that are. The e-commerce giant has quietly blocked more OpenAI-related bots from crawling Amazon.com, according to updates in its publicly visible robots.txt file.

Title: Apple eliminates dozens of jobs across its sales organization

Update font size. Reset Apple is cutting dozens of enterprise sales positions as part of a restructuring aimed at simplifying how it sells to businesses, schools, and government clients. The eliminated roles include account managers and staff who ran Apple’s dedicated briefing centers used for institutional meetings and product demos. A company spokesperson confirmed the changes, saying the move will allow Apple to reach more customers, and that impacted employees are eligible to apply for other open positions inside the company. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ Apple confirmed on Monday that it’s reshuffling the division, without giving specifics. “To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles,” a spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. “We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.” It’s unusual for Apple to make cuts across an organization, and the layoffs came as a surprise to those affected. The move is especially notable because revenue has been growing at the fastest clip in years. Apple is on track to generate sales of nearly $140 billion in the December quarter, smashing its previous record. Employees who lost their jobs have until Jan. 20 to secure another position within the company or they’ll be terminated with a severance package. Apple is advertising sales roles on its jobs website and told laid-off workers they could apply for them. Internally, the company is positioning the layoffs as part of an effort to streamline its sales workforce and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. But some of the affected workers said the move was driven by an effort to shift more sales to third-party resellers, which the company refers to as the channel. Some organizations prefer to work with those indirect sellers, they said, and the change helps Apple lower internal costs like salaries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: When a company decides a different go-to-market model will be more efficient or scalable, certain positions can become superfluous. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Epic CEO: "RAM price increases will be a real problem" — as OpenAI et al. blow up RAM prices, threatening affordability of everything from Xbox to TVs and laptops

The AI fad is destroying the affordability of RAM, as demand from OpenAI, Google, and others blow up prices. Why is this happening? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Gamers can't seem to catch a break, although this latest goldrush is going to impact far more than just gamers this time around. After years of dealing with the crypto craze blowing up GPU prices, the artificial intelligence fad being pushed by companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others, is now having a serious impact on the affordability and scarcity of RAM. For those who don't know, RAM (random access memory) is used as temporary memory storage used to store and access data on a short-term basis. Simplified, you can think of it as your computer's short-term memory, and is designed for on-demand rapidity so apps and games can run instantly. You can find it in basically any "smart" device, from TVs to phones to laptops, to Xbox consoles and gaming PCs. In just a few weeks, the general price of consumer-grade DDR5 RAM has increased in some cases by as much as 110%, with products like Micron's Crucial Pro 32GB DDR5 kit effectively doubling in price in the space of a month. And things might only get worse. Speaking on X, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney described the scale of the problem, as government-backed companies like OpenAI outbid consumer manufacturers on RAM fabrication priorities. RAM price increases will be a real problem for high-end gaming for several years. Factories are diverting leading edge DRAM capacity to meet AI needs where data centers are bidding far higher than consumer device makers. https://t.co/VgO2OG4oOrNovember 24, 2025 Indeed, companies like OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others are striking massive deals with RAM manufacturers such as Samsung and SK Hynix to supply their data centers. Artificial intelligence is the tech fad du jour, with governments and shareholders seemingly convinced that the technology is critical for national security (and also lowering firm's costs by offloading tasks to clankers robots instead of humans). True or not, it's the main driving force behind these price increases. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. OpenAI and others are being given massive loans and subsidies (often paid for by taxpayers) and require absolutely enormous quantities of electricity, processing, and also memory capacity. Backed by nation states and the full force of Wall Street hype, manufacturers of consumer-grade goods like laptops, video game consoles, and TVs typically already endure thin margins — they cannot outbid the likes of OpenAI on data center component purchasing. Some manufacturers have stockpiled RAM specifically to avoid price increases on their products in the interim to try and weather the storm. There were some rumors that Xbox Series X|S consoles, which have recently endured price increases, would be rapidly exposed to further increases as a result of this. Sources tell me that Microsoft does have a healthy supply of Xbox, Surface, and other RAM-using stock for the time being. But of course, those stocks will not last forever — for any manufacturer. Indeed, the current wave of AI hype doesn't seem likely it will die down any time soon. Once any existing consumer tech supplies dwindle for any manufacturer, products like Xbox and PlayStation consoles, television sets, laptops, and more, could start to see serious price increases over time. The volatility between AI demand and tariffs is why we didn't get the Xbox Ally prices until the very last minute, and why we still don't have the Steam Machine prices either. Things are just generally crazy right now, to use industry terms. The first to feel the pinch will be anyone who is buying RAM standalone to upgrade their PCs or existing laptops. The world only has so much capacity to produce RAM, meaning demand will likely exceed supply for the foreseeable. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron control some 90% of the market together. Consumer tech manufacturers will bid for chips from these companies directly for their own products. And given the out-sized purchasing power from companies like OpenAI, flooded with investor cash, us peasants will have to endure the scraps for the time being. It's just another thing for the pile of reasons to hate this big AI fad — destroyed livelihoods, greenhouse gasses, electricity prices, layoffs, stolen water supplies, toxic chemicals, turbo-charged false information industry, mental health degradation, and now rapidly ballooning consumer goods prices.
