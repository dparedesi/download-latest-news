This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google’s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here – it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today’s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it’s not a problem that’s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. The scheme, dubbed “SlopAds,” relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN’s technical report, with the “Slop” moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to “cashout” domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. HUMAN described SlopAds’ use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, “The exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.” As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android’s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. “HUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,” added Kaye. HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack — from attribution to steganography — to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace. ‘Quite frankly, ignorant’: Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale rebukes The Trade Desk’s SSP ‘reseller’ tag The Trade Desk’s reclassification of all supply-side platforms as “resellers” faces pushback from major players like Index Exchange, who call it an oversimplification. This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk’s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk’s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon’s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon’s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal. The move helps Netflix ease buying and boost performance, as Amazon positions itself as the central hub of streaming’s growing ad economy. “This is actually going to be a problem for second-tier demand-side platforms. As ‘open web’ declines, you need to get in with the ‘hedged gardens.’” – An anonymous source reacts to news that “Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy.” A development that had a calamitous impact on The Trade Desk’s stock price. What’s next for Streamr.ai now that it’s been acquired by Magnite? Magnite announced it had acquired Streamr.ai, which specializes in developing AI-generated assets for small businesses to use in their CTV campaigns. Magnite CPO Adam Soroca explains more to AdExchanger. Scope3 lays off staff as part of shift toward agentic advertising Adweek discusses layoffs at the startup led by Brian O’Kelley. While the number of layoffs wasn’t confirmed in the piece, sources told Digiday the number was close to 20%, with the cuts impacting multiple departments, including former senior European leadership. With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google’s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side – the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google’s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer’s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google’s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema’s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors. Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience. The deal comes a week after Amazon announced a similar deal with Netflix, causing the stock price of rival DSP The Trade Desk to falter. The platform is rolling out broadly to both agencies and small- and mid-sized businesses that are looking to control more of their media investment destiny.

Title: Business Is Booming for Many Tech Giants. They're Laying Workers Off Anyway.

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

Title: NBCU's one-size-fits-all severance package for RTO workers shows just how much power employers have right now
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-severance-offer-rto-mandate-worker-loyalty-nbcu-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-12T17:56:56Z
Full Content:
The standard, tenure-based severance package is being put to the test. NBCUniversal is offering separation pay that isn't tied to employees' number of years on the job, an atypical move that some leadership experts say risks denting worker loyalty in the long term. The media giant told employees this week that if they don't want to comply with a new return-to-office mandate, they can leave and take a severance package comprising eight weeks of base salary, Business Insider first reported. The financial part of the arrangement is unusual, experts say, because severance packages are normally aligned with employees' length of service. An NBCU spokesperson previously declined to comment on internal communications and policies and didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. If other companies follow NBCU's example, workers may become less inclined to stay with any one employer for more than a few years, cautioned Raj Namboothiry, head of staffing firm Manpower's US division. That's because a potential future severance package would exclude the kind of safety net they could count on with a traditional package, he said. Since standard packages are tied to tenure, the longer an employee stays with a company, the bigger the payout they would receive. To be sure, NBCU is providing its eight-week pay-for-all packages on a voluntary basis. Companies including Amazon issued RTO mandates without granting any severance pay to workers who choose not to comply. Extending fixed payouts after more general layoffs would be dicier as far as loyalty goes, said Namboothiry, since workers would have no choice in the matter. These days, fixed severance packages after either layoffs or RTO mandates may not pose a problem for most leaders since job opportunities are scarce, said Nicole Kyle, cofounder of CMP Research, a research and advisory firm focused on the future of work. More people are currently unemployed and actively looking for work than there are job opportunities, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Employers have the leverage right now," Kyle said. But should the tables turn down the line, fixed packages may discourage people from seeking jobs at firms with a reputation for offering them in lieu of the standard tenure-based kind, Kyle added. "The labor market is going to remember," she said. There is some precedent to companies offering fixed payouts as part of voluntary separation agreements, but it is rare. In late 2021, online mortgage startup Better abruptly laid off about 900 employees and provided them with 60 days of severance pay, regardless of tenure. A more high-profile example occurred about five months after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022. The billionaire sent the social-media company's employees an email instructing them to fill out a form asking if they wanted to remain at the company and be part of an "extremely hardcore" culture, Business Insider reported at the time. Employees who didn't opt to stay would be given three months of severance, Musk said in the email. Many Twitter employees took the deal. NBCU's package is available to US and UK staffers at the vice-president level and below. They must accept it by October 3 and stay through the end of 2025. By giving nearly four months' notice, NBCU is letting its work-from-home aficionados get a big jump-start on their job search in a tough market, said Anna Tavis, New York University's department chair of human capital management. While eight weeks of pay isn't a large sum for those at the VP level, Tavis said it could be an enticing offer for lower-level employees, which she believes may be NBCU's intention. It also might be more enticing for newer employees, said Kyle. Offering the same number of weeks' worth of severance pay for all departing staffers would likely appeal less to longterm employees who'd be eligible to receive far more money with a tenure-based package, she said. Employers looking to trim their workforces may be using return-to-office orders as an alternative to layoffs, expecting some employees to quit rather than comply, as Business Insider has reported. Tavis said that the approach is "less painful and more humane" than mass cuts. Still, the move poses risks, she added, as companies could see top talent walk out the door and land a job at a competitor that allows remote or more hybrid work. "You often first lose the people who have other options," Tavis said. Jump to

Title: Why Does David Ellison Want Paramount to Swallow Warner Bros. Discovery Whole? To Beat Rival Suitors to the Punch
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/paramount-warner-bros-discovery-acquisition-consolidation-analysis-1236515947/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor David Ellison’s Skydance Media just completed the $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global five weeks ago. Now, before Ellison and his team have even finished the work of laying off upwards of 2,000 employees at the newly merged Paramount Skydance to slash costs, the son of tech multibillionaire Larry Ellison is mulling what would currently be a $70 billion-plus deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The question is: Why now? Popular on Variety Related Stories Guillermo del Toro on Sunday Paintings With Other Directors and the Brutality and Grace of 'Frankenstein': 'Both Can Exist in the Same Body' Cambodia Submits Horror Thriller 'Tenement' as Oscar Entry Wouldn’t it make more sense to wait until WBD splits in half — to form Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks) — a transaction CEO David Zaslav says is on track to be done in April 2026? The WBD separation is designed to boost the value of its streaming and studios businesses by carving off the declining TV arm. Paramount Skydance could make a play for the standalone Warner Bros. without assuming the baggage (including the lion’s share of WBD debt) of the entity that will house CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery and other nets. And through a deal for standalone Warner Bros., Paramount Skydance would still get its hands on the key growth driver going forward: HBO Max. (The mind reels at what a fused HBO Max-Paramount+ might be rebranded.) One possibility is that a Larry Ellison-backed M&A play for WBD has been part of the Skydance strategy all along. The idea would be “to consolidate media assets during a period of industry-wide instability and build a conglomerate with a streaming-first focus wrapped with TV and film studios and potentially a larger linear television portfolio,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note Thursday. And the advantage of moving now is that it could “preempt a potential bidding war for only the Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios assets post-split,” Fishman noted. “By acting now, [Paramount Skydance] positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets.” Indeed, prior to news of Paramount Skydance’s prepping a bid for WBD, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Wells Fargo media analyst Steven Cahall issued a note that pegged the future standalone Warner Bros. as “an attractive M&A candidate” — with Netflix “the most compelling buyer,” and other potential suitors including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Sony and Paramount Skydance. Regarding the separated Warner Bros. streaming and studios biz, Cahall wrote, “This will be the only large IP asset for sale at a time when most studios/streamers have big aspirations.” The analyst acknowledged that Netflix has not historically made any big M&A deals. But he opined a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. had a number of benefits, including being able to “kickstart” a theatrical strategy for the streamer, help it scale video games and “most importantly [provide] premium content to members.” Cahall calculated the value of standalone Warner Bros. at around $65 billion. To be sure, any Paramount Skydance offer for Warner Bros. Discovery would face big financial and regulatory obstacles — arguably much greater than those that arose with the Skydance-Paramount merger. After Warner Bros. Discovery shares zoomed up 29% on the potential Paramount bid, WBD now has a market value of $40 billion. When adding in debt (minus cash and equivalents), the enterprise value of Warner Bros. Discovery is now about $71 billion. And that is a far bigger price than the Ellisons paid to swing Skydance-Paramount. “We think the high debt leverage of WBD is an impediment to a high bid for WBD’s shares,” Kenneth Leon, director of industry and equity research at CFRA Research, said in a Sept. 11 note. He suggested that, even if Paramount Skydance wins a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole, it may “be only interested in the businesses that will become Warner Bros. and not see meaningful value creation from the Discovery Global media portfolio.” But MoffettNathanson’s Fishman speculated that Paramount Skydance could see big benefits by pooling its TV business with WBD’s. “Overall, we would expect material cost synergies from the overlapping cable networks,” he wrote — i.e., layoffs. Fishman added that there are “presumably a high level of synergies from combining CBS News with CNN plus the long-term existing partnership between CBS and Turner with the NCAA’s March Madness Final Four.” Then there’s the question of whether a Paramount-WBD tie-up could get regulatory approval, as it represents a more horizontal combination of two media giants than Skydance-Paramount. Skydance was largely a production company, with limited overlap with Paramount Global. Already coming out against the notion of a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who wrote in a post on X Thursday that such a media merger “must be blocked as a dangerous concentration of power.” The Trump administration OK’d the Skydance-Paramount merger, after Skydance made key concessions to the FCC including hiring a CBS News ombudsman to vet complaints of “bias” and promising to never bring back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the company. But Warren and others have alleged Paramount Global’s $16 million payment to Trump to settle his lawsuit (alleging CBS News’ “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with then-VP Kamala Harris) was a “bribe” to get Trump’s blessing on their deal while Warren also called out Trump’s claim that the new owners of Paramount promised $20 million worth of free advertising. “Remember when Trump announced a multimillion-dollar secret deal with CEO David Ellison? And then — shocker — Trump approved Ellison buying CBS/Paramount,” Warren wrote in the post. “Now, Ellison wants to take over CNN/Warner Bros.” (Skydance and Paramount said they complied with all U.S. laws throughout the merger process, including antibribery laws.) Whatever scenario ultimately unfolds, Zaslav for one seemingly will see his wish for media biz consolidation realized. After Trump was elected to a second term in November 2024, Zaslav expressed optimism the new administration would facilitate industry M&A. Trump 2.0, Zaslav said, “may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different” and that it may “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger Makes Sense | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The ink is barely dry on the $8 billion Skydance merger and the Ellisons may already be eyeing their next target Fresh off its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount appears ready to pounce on Warner Bros. Discovery in a bid to merge its way to becoming a next-generation media giant. Paramount’s new CEO David Ellison is reportedly preparing a majority cash bid for all of WBD’s assets, including its cable networks and movie studio. According to the Wall Street Journal, it would be backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — David’s father and newly-crowned as the world’s richest man. Warner stock closed up nearly 30% at the end of Thursday’s trading session, while Paramount was up more than 5%, with both companies hitting new 52-week highs of $17.24 and $87.89 per share, respectively. Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. A potential deal would give the diminished Paramount and Warner Discovery much-needed scale and an increased arsenal of content at a time where they’ve lagged behind Netflix and Disney in the streaming wars. Combined the new company would have a total of 203.4 million streaming subscribers as of the latest figures from the second quarter of 2025 — putting it just shy of Disney’s 207.4 million across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ in its latest quarter. Reaching numbers to be competitive with Disney and Netflix has been a long-stated aim of Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Paramount would also be able to tap Warner’s massive portfolio of assets, including Warner Bros. Television and Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Discovery+, a slew of cable networks and other media businesses, including production studios in Burbank, California, and Leavesden, England. They would be paired with Paramount assets including the CBS network, Paramount Pictures and its studio, along with streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV and cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Nickelodeon. Additionally, the companies would have stronger bargaining power with advertisers, distributors and talent and the opportunity to generate massive cost savings. Paramount has already identified more than $2 billion in merger-related cuts that will be carried out through layoffs, a review of its real estate portfolio and a transformation of its technological infrastructure. Wolfe Research’s Peter Supino estimates that a combined Paramount-WBD could generate $3 billion in cost synergies, including roughly $1.5 billion from streaming & studios, $1.2 billion from Warner Bros. corporate costs and roughly $250 million from linear networks. “It’s a brilliant move,” Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of the Los Angeles-based investment firm Greif & Co., told TheWrap. “Everybody knows Larry Ellison has the ability to pull it off. So let there be no doubt, this is a doable deal, even though Paramount is a minnow and Warner is a whale. I don’t think anybody on the street has any doubts that they can complete this transaction.” Merging the two media companies together would catapult David Ellison further into the upper strata of power players in the entertainment world, one he had just entered through Skydance’s merger with Paramount. It would also expand the influence of the Ellison family in the media and tech space. In addition to WBD, the younger Ellison has been circling Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. President Donald Trump has also previously expressed support for the elder Ellison’s Oracle to buy TikTok. “For the Ellisons, pulling this off would crown their effort to build a next-gen Hollywood major,” Qualia Legacy Advisors managing director Aaron Meyerson said. “For David Zaslav, it could provide a strategic exit after years of cost-cutting and debt management.” That said, Hollywood insiders bemoaned the prospect of losing yet another major studio. “You have 20 percent fewer people to sell to. Finding the next Jordan Peele, the next Daniels [Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] — the threshold gets harder and harder,” said one top executive from a rival studio. “And does it become a free for all? Does Apple try to buy Universal?” the executive continued, suggesting that the sparse details from Thursday’s leak suggests a trial balloon rather than a serious bid. “If I were looking to do R&D and test the market, today was very successful,” this person said. Even if a deal goes through, Howard Homonoff, a strategic advisor to media and tech companies and managing director of Homonoff Media Group, told TheWrap that many important strategic questions remain unanswered. For one, the combined company could be exposed to too many cable networks at a time when that business is in decline. It’s also unclear if combining Paramount+ and HBO Max would be enough to close the gap with streaming heavy-hitter Netflix. “It’s a bigger player, but it still leaves a lot of questions for future investors about what the growth strategy is,” Homonoff said. Still, the chance to increase the reach and scale of the companies may be worth the risk. Ellison’s move comes as the Zaslav-led media giant has been working towards a split of its linear network (Discovery Global) and studios and streaming businesses (Warner Bros.) by mid-2026. MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said that getting a bid early could preempt a potential bidding war for WBD’s streaming and studio assets post-split. “By acting now, Paramount positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets,” Fishman wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “Perhaps just as important, the odds of the deal clearing regulatory review may be higher for the Skydance team given its recent success in closing the Paramount transaction.” Among the potential rival bidders that Fishman floated include Comcast, which is currently in the process of its own spin off of network assets with Versant, and Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which previously kicked the tires on Paramount prior to Ellison’s acquisition. Representatives for Comcast, Apollo and Sony did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Greif also didn’t rule out the possibility of a big tech player like Apple, Amazon, Google or other private equity firms entering the ring. “Warner Brothers is an extremely attractive asset. I think everybody pays attention to this one and doesn’t let it go,” Greif said. “Splitting would have definitely attracted a feeding frenzy. This move is trying to catch everybody flat footed, but you can’t really catch anybody flat footed for long. They’re all going to think long and hard about getting into a bidding war with Larry Ellison.” While a deal is doable, there will obviously be key challenges for Ellison to overcome if he ultimately makes a bid. Among the challenges are WBD’s massive $35.6 billion in gross debt to pay down on top of Paramount’s own $15.5 billion. Experts also aren’t ruling out potential antitrust, regulatory or political scrutiny from the Trump administration and other lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already knocked a potential tie-up as a “dangerous concentration of power” and warned it “must be blocked.” “Regulators would scrutinize overlaps in broadcast (CBS), cable news (CNN), sports rights and streaming under the (Department of Justice)’s tougher merger guidelines and to a lesser extent the FCC,” Meyerson said. “It’s a bold swing with real industrial logic, but the political and financial execution risks are equally large.” Any deal, however, would likely be supported by the deep-pockets of the elder Ellison, whose net worth sits at $367.2 billion. And given Paramount’s $7.7 billion bid to acquire the rights to UFC, the Ellisons have shown they’re willing to spare no expense if it gives them a competitive advantage. On the regulatory front, the Ellisons have already done a lot of work to gain favor with Trump, who could ease any regulatory concerns. There’s also the question of whether Zaslav is ready to hand over the reins or not, though this isn’t the first time a merger with Paramount has been mulled. Ultimately, if the offer is rich enough, it may not be up to him. “There will be pressure on him to act in the interest of the shareholders,” Greif said. “If the deal is deemed to be an attractive price, it’s a deal that gets done whether Zaslav has a position post-closing, or whether he just smiles all the way into happy temporary retirement. And it would be temporary retirement. Guys like that don’t stay on the sidelines for long.” Sharon Waxman contributed reporting to this story.

Title: The Highest-Paid TV Hosts Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2025/09/12/the-highest-paid-tv-hosts-of-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-12T10:00:00Z

ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. Nowhere is the structural decline of linear television more on full display than in late night. For decades, the shows were reliable cash cows for the networks, but in recent years analysts estimate that none turn a profit. Then, in July, CBS made the abrupt decision to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing $40 million in losses per year. And both ABC and NBC trimmed budgets last fall by moving to four-nights-per-week, whether their hosts wanted to or not. “I was bummed,” Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon tells Forbes. “I want to do it five days a week. I love doing it.” Still, a late-night talk show gig comes with a salary that places Fallon ($16 million), Jimmy Kimmel ($16 million) and Stephen Colbert ($15 million) among the highest-paid hosts on television, according to Forbes estimates. Even in its diminished state, linear television still generates significant revenue for networks, and it’s the talent from categories like late-night, morning shows, primetime news, sports and lifestyle who remain TV’s biggest stars. Combined, the top 25 hosts earn an estimated $582 million. With few exceptions, they make far more money than the stars of TV’s hit scripted shows. But with late-night extinction seemingly on the horizon, many have begun questioning whether hosts like Fallon will be the last to lead their respective programs—even one as long-running and venerable as The Tonight Show, which NBC has aired since 1954. “Oh gosh,” Fallon says, while contemplating whether he will be Tonight’s last host. “No, there'll be someone else. And I don't think it'll be a robot. I think it has to be a human being that makes mistakes and has a real conversation with people.” At the very least, it’s almost certain that this generation of TV stars will be the last mega-earners the medium ever produces. Most in the top 25 hosts have been in the spotlight for decades, and across the board, agents and managers report a strong downward pressure on compensation during contract renewal negotiations. Often the best that top talent can hope for is to maintain their salary from past years, and in many cases networks require work on additional shows or projects to justify staying at the same level financially. For example, in addition to late-night, Fallon and Kimmel now host game shows for their respective networks. Elsewhere, celebrity chefs are still living extra-large. Guy Fieri ($33 million), Bobby Flay ($33 million) and Gordon Ramsay ($33 million) each oversee a small universe of shows, and have earned overall production deals similar to those given to top scripted TV showrunners, trading profit participation for guaranteed annual fees. The details of these deals are usually closely guarded secrets. When one leaks out, like Fieri’s three-year, $100 million deal with the Food Network in late 2023, it can cause a correction in the market as competitors demand the same compensation—as was the case for Flay and Ramsay. And large contracts make for bad optics when networks have layoffs. Disney, for example, cut nearly 200 jobs from its ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks divisions in March, just a few months after renewing Good Morning America’s George Stephanopolous for an estimated $17 million annually. The exception to this trend is sports, where salaries have risen sharply in recent years and new talent has had the opportunity to break-in. Sports broadcasters and studio personalities account for eight of the top 25 this year, including seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, who, as a Fox football analyst, tops the list at $37.5 million annually. In the not-too-distant past, the idea that sports broadcasters could make more money than the athletes they talk about would have been ludicrous. But with media companies shelling out billions for league rights, and those games becoming by far the most-watched events on television, paying a few million more for premium talent is seen both as an insurance policy for content quality and also an incentive for leagues to steer their best games to the network. The 48-year-old Brady was hired, for example, to bring star power to Fox’s NFL broadcasts after Troy Aikman ($18 million) and Joe Buck ($16 million) were lured away to call ESPN’s biggest football games. “As sports becomes a differentiator, and as sports rights become more precious and expensive, given both the attention and the number of entities negotiating for them, that certainly causes other content formats and money to be pushed out,” says Neal Zuckerman, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. “There's only so much you can spend on content in order to make a reasonably profitable business.” Another bright spot on the list is the number of women who are represented. Three hosts —Judy Sheindlen ($30 million), Rachel Maddow and Robin Roberts (both at $25 million)—are among the 10 highest-paid personalities on TV, while two more, Savannah Guthrie ($24 million) and Kelly Ripa ($22 million), rank among the top 15. But those outsize paydays will soon come to an end. Streaming platforms do not offer talent salaries comparable to the largest TV deals. Instead, platforms like YouTube share 55% of ad revenue with creators, incentivizing talent to bet on themselves. When the model works, it gives hosts bargaining power, as is the case with Pat McAfee ($20 million), who maintains ownership and editorial control of his daily talk show while licensing it to ESPN for a hefty fee (a portion of those earnings go toward paying his staff and production costs). Many in the industry believe there will be more deals like his in the future. In the meantime, here are the hosts commanding the most. Television insiders say the true value of Fox's Hail Mary deal to land the seven-time Super Bowl champion after his retirement from football in 2022 is impossible to calculate, since some of his compensation is in company stock (the price of which has risen significantly since Brady signed). In addition to his duties in the commentary booth, which began last fall to mixed reviews, Brady serves as a Fox ambassador in a number of company functions, which are used to justify the enormous compensation package. The mayor of Flavortown reset the market for lifestyle talent with his three-year, $100 million overall deal signed in late 2023, making him the highest-paid talent at the Food Network after it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery a year earlier. The 57-year-old restauranteur has made nearly 600 episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives since it debuted in 2007, and he produces or appears in numerous programs across the WBD portfolio. Overall deals like Flay’s, which was renewed in November to match Fieri's annual total, charges every talent, producing and personal appearance fee, and in some cases even cuts of ancillary businesses like physical products and restaurants, against a set annual total. To make the deal worth it, the 60-year-old chef will have to stay busy, with Bobby’s Triple Threat debuting earlier this month and two other shows, Beat Bobby Flay and BBQ Brawl, currently in production. Much like the other top chefs on TV, Ramsay has set up a mini-universe of culinary shows for Fox, including Hell’s Kitchen, MasterChef, and Next Level Chef, enough to land the same top-of-market overall deal value in March. Yet unlike Bobby Flay and Guy Fieri, the 58-year-old Ramsay currently holds eight Michelin stars in his restaurant group and 40 million followers on TikTok, where he blew up during the pandemic roasting other users’ cooking videos. HBO's late-night offering Last Week Tonight is an Emmys juggernaut—winning 30 statues in the past 10 years—and drives an impressive amount of sign-ups to the re-rechristened HBO Max, which is how its 48-year-old host has earned a deal nearly double the size of what his late-night colleagues make at the networks. Much to Oliver's dismay, last year Warner Bros. Discovery hoped to maximize streaming engagement by delaying the posting of the show's clips to YouTube for several days, but reversed course with the 12th season in February. $30 million In her heyday, Judge Judy commanded more than $45 million per year for her eponymous show and owned the rights to its catalog of episodes. Since selling the rights back to CBS and leaving the network in 2021 (she remains a producer on the network's Hot Bench), the 82-year-old Sheindlin has started up three new court shows on Amazon's streaming channels. In a 2024 deal renewal, Amazon began syndicating Judy Justice and Tribunal Justice out to hundreds of local TV stations, an important bargaining chip to maintain her lofty fees. Last September, Seacrest replaced the legendary Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune, in addition to his regular hosting duties on American Idol and ABC’s New Years Eve program (which he also produces). Add in his radio show, which runs for four hours every weekday and pays him more than $10 million per year, and the 50-year-old host is almost never not on the air. Strahan is earning more money as a TV host than he ever did as a Hall of Fame defensive end for the New York Giants. He has lucrative deals with both Fox, as a studio analyst on the network's NFL coverage, and with ABC, to co-host Good Morning America and The $100,000 Pyramid. In addition to his TV work, Strahan also has revenue from personal appearances and his company, SMAC Entertainment, a talent management company that houses his personal brand. While meteoric talents have come and gone from Fox News, the 63-year-old Hannity has been at the network since its inception in 1996, making him the longest-running primetime host in cable history. And these days, TV isn't even his main gig—Hannity’s syndicated radio program reaches more than 600 stations nationwide, and his ownership stake in the show earns him more than $30 million each year. During an MSNBC contract renewal in late 2024, it's estimated that Maddow took a salary cut from $30 million annually to $25 million (a network spokesperson disputed the reported number), two years after switching from a five-nights-a-week schedule to appearing only on Mondays. Still, she remains the face of the recently rebranded MS NOW and has found other platforms to share her political commentary, including a weekly podcast and a handful of best-selling books. Morning shows are not only still highly profitable, in the case of Good Morning America, Forbes estimates the show accounts for the majority of ABC’s broadcast news revenue. That’s why the 64-year-old Roberts, who has co-anchored GMA for more than 20 years and has overseen the network’s No. 1 position in the ratings for the last 13 years consecutively, is the highest-paid talent at ABC. She also hosts primetime specials, such as a 20-year anniversary retrospective on Hurricane Katrina, which aired in late August. Going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump at a town hall in 2020 led to a massive pay raise for the 53-year-old Today host, who was the highest-paid member of the show even before the departure of co-host Hoda Kotb in January, because of her ability to handle important political interviews for NBC as well as holiday specials like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. The 54-year-old morning show fixture has been through many co-hosts since taking the Live! job in early 2001, working with Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and Ryan Seacrest before being paired with her husband, Mark Consuelos, in 2023. The duo also have a separate series on ESPN, Running With The Wolves, cataloging their journey owning Italian soccer club Campobasso FC. Just a few years into a 10-year, $210 million contract with Turner Sports, Barkley threatened to retire last fall after his network lost the rights to broadcast NBA games. Instead, a deal was struck allowing Inside The NBA to continue being produced by Turner—keeping in place Barkley’s long-time co-hosts Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O’Neal (who Forbes estimates makes $15 million for the role)— but air before and after games on ESPN and ABC. In March, the reigning champion of sports talk shows got a pay bump from $12 million to $20 million annually, believed to be the largest contract ever given to an ESPN talent. As part of the new deal, Stephen A. will actually appear on fewer ESPN programs, freeing up time for projects such as his podcast—and though he's denied it many times, perhaps a run at presidential politics. ESPN's deal with the former Indiana Colts punter includes talent fees for his work on College Gameday and a licensing fee to air The Pat McAfee Show on the network, which the 38-year-old host uses to pay his staff and production costs. The deal structure means less take-home pay, but he maintains ownership and editorial control of the program. McAfee also served as a longtime commentator for WWE matches until June, when he stepped back from the role, citing fatigue. ESPN’s desire to have a Super Bowl-ready broadcast team for the 2026 season came at a price, luring the Hall of Famer away from Fox with a contract that is just a wee bit larger than the one CBS gave to fellow former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Romo’s total includes money he pays to a traveling editorial assistant and spotter on game days. Romo’s 10-year, $180 million deal with CBS kicked off an earnings bonanza in early 2020, ushering in the era where NFL broadcast talent can earn more money than most of the players on the field. While the ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback still sits in the No. 1 booth with Jim Nantz, he could soon be feeling the pressure around the corner from former defensive end JJ Watt, who was recently signed to CBS' No. 2 team. Though Cooper serves as an occasional correspondent to CBS’ 60 Minutes, the real money comes from his work on CNN, where he hosts a primetime show every weeknight and a weekly deep dive show on Sundays. The 58-year-old has been at the network since 2001. Since 2010, Harvey has hosted more than 1,100 episodes of Family Feud, not including international versions and spin-offs. One of those, Celebrity Family Feud, had its biggest season premiere in three years in July, attracting 4.2 million viewers. The 68-year-old earns also earns several million from a syndicated radio show on weekday mornings. A verbal slip-up from the Good Morning America co-host last fall led to Donald Trump’s libel lawsuit against ABC and the network’s subsequent $15 million settlement payout. But ABC immediately backed the 64-year-old political veteran, renewing his deal in December. In addition to GMA and This Week With George Stephanopolous, the pact includes a new politics show on Hulu and four hour-long primetime specials, though it’s ABC’s David Muir, not Stephanopolous, who will continue to host the network’s special news reports. In one of the more unique sports media moves in recent history, Fox let Joe Buck out of the last year of his contract in 2022 to join booth partner Troy Aikman at ESPN, in exchange for the broadcast rights to a Penn State-Purdue college football game. The 56-year-old Buck is now the highest-paid play-by-play announcer in sports history, and though he called a record 24 World Series at his previous network, he’s largely stuck to Monday Night Football at ESPN, outside of a few one-off MLB games like this year’s Opening Day Brewers-Yankees game. $16 million With a show ready-made for social media, Fallon’s The Tonight Show dominates late-night competitors in the digital space—but remains third in the ratings. And the 50-year-old host has found another use for his joyful enthusiasm, hosting game shows like Password and That’s My Jam as well as a new reality competition show On Brand that debuts on NBC on September 30. ABC’s late-night host since 2003, Kimmel has publicly mulled retirement for years and has a contract that will expire in mid-2026. Outside of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 57-year-old comedian hosts the rebooted celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and voiced a character in this summer’s Smurfs movie. During this Emmy season, Kimmel has actively campaigned for his direct competitor, Stephen Colbert, calling CBS’s claims that Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year “beyond nonsensical." Colbert is a favorite to win the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series this weekend, which would be his first win as host of The Late Show—though he did previously win 10 for The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. The 61-year-old host will remain on CBS until next May, and news of his cancellation has only juiced his viewership ratings further over his competitors. Estimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts. The figures represent pretax earnings specifically for TV work, though many talents on the list earn significant additional income from radio, endorsements, entrepreneurial ventures, personal appearances, investments or other categories. Fees for representation (agent, manager, lawyer etc.) are not deducted. Hosts are compensated with variety of deal structures, including traditional salaries, overall production deals for a slate of projects, or licensing agreements from which a talent pays staff and production costs. The above rankings estimate the total earnings paid by media companies to talent.

Title: AT&T tracked employee attendance to find 'freeloaders.' Now, it admits the system is driving workers to the 'brink of frustration.'

AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is "driving people to the brink of frustration." The system, known internally as presence reporting, automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office. Most are required to log at least eight hours a day, five days a week, on-site. The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity. In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. The system was originally introduced to identify employees who weren't showing up in the office. "We recognize that there's things about the report that are not correct," she said, according to audio obtained by Business Insider. "It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis." AT&T is also deemphasizing use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide, a person familiar with the matter said. CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports. "We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts," he wrote, "to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations." Stankey said that an individual's data must differ "significantly" from their peers before their name is attached to the behavior. "Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like," he said. Kenny said during the August meeting that the employee survey (which prompted the blunt memo from Stankey) had "lots of feedback" about the presence reports. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example. Read more about Stankey's memo. While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's "policies and systems support me in delivering my best work." Kenny said in the meeting that roughly half of the respondents in her organization said "no," and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate and presence reports in the freeform response. "I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created," Kenny said. "I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust." Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience. A spokesperson for AT&T declined to comment for this story, instead citing Stankey's August memo. Multiple employees told Business Insider that the system doesn't just log badge swipes at the entrance or exit; the presence report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to infer the hours an employee was at their assigned office. The tool was rolled out in response to the RTO push that began two years ago, and its usage ramped up as the attendance policy grew increasingly strict. Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. Amazon previously used categories like "inconsistent badger" or "zero badger" depending on an employee's compliance with a three-day in-office mandate. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion. A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action. Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a "huge amount of distrust" in the company. At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify "freeloaders" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day. "There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left," she said. "The report was good for identifying the people who were abusing the system. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders." AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information. AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight. They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week. "It was at its worst in March and April," one worker in New Jersey told Business Insider. "Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting." Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs. Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have "encouraged" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs. AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. The company started this year with around 140,000 employees, down from more than 160,000 at the start of 2023. Telecom competitors Verizon and T-Mobile started 2025 with 99,000 and 70,000, respectively. Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies. One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday. "We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done," he said. Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time. "The attitude has shifted," the New Jersey employee said. "They only count eight hours, so I'm just going to work eight hours." The AT&T employees Business Insider spoke with said their presence reports have gotten more accurate over the past few months. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement. The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve. Have a tip?

Flip employees were riding high in mid-January. The TikTok challenger had just cracked the Apple App Store's top-five ranking. Downloads soared 855% month over month, Sensor Tower data showed, fueled by TikTok's imminent ban in the US. It was a dream scenario for an app that — with over $230 million in funding and a roughly $1.1 billion valuation — promised to reinvent social shopping through a mix of product reviews and entertaining videos. Raging wildfires had forced Flip's CEO, Noor Agha, to evacuate his Los Angeles home before he had time to retrieve his car or pack an extra pair of underwear. But in a January 15 interview with Agha and COO Eduardo Vivas, the executives sounded upbeat, if not a little frenzied. "To be in the business that we're in, given all the changes that are happening, is obviously very exciting for us," Vivas said at the time. Seven months later, Flip was dead. This is the story of how Flip crashed, as told by nine former employees, along with investors, creator partners, talent managers, and brands. Agha, Vivas, and other company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Days after Business Insider's interview with Flip's top executives, President Donald Trump halted the TikTok ban. Flip raced to sustain its momentum, pouring money into ads and launching a $100 million equity fund to woo creators. With TikTok back in play, the buzz fizzled. Things unraveled quickly from there. In April, Trump tariffs raised costs for some Flip vendors and brand partners. Then Flip slashed jobs and began clearing out its LA headquarters. In May, the company received an eviction notice for its LA warehouse. By June, the company had slipped out of Apple's US App Store top 100, and within weeks, it cut much of its remaining staff without severance, three ex-staffers said. Flip shut down its app in late August. The company's demise caught many off guard. Employees who had watched a spike in downloads and onboarding of new brands believed business was humming. "I was as shocked as I could have been when that last round of layoffs came and how quickly it dissolved from there," one former Flip worker said. "This year, there were very optimistic conversations about where we were going and the idea that this was going to become huge." Flip's fate showcases the uphill battle that consumer startups face when trying to compete with tech giants like TikTok, Meta, or Google. The company spent millions of dollars to recruit creators and onboard new users via ads and referral credits. But competing with Big Tech companies, which have billions of users and the ability to outspend you at every turn, is no easy task. "It's actually crazy to build a new complete social platform from scratch," Agha told Business Insider in January. "The amount of pieces to make a social platform work is so insanely hard." It also demonstrates how difficult it has been for US companies to blend social video and commerce. TikTok has struggled to live up to its leadership's expectations for its e-commerce platform, Shop. Meta pulled back on some of its e-commerce bets, and Amazon killed its TikTok-like feed, Inspire, earlier this year. "Changing shopping behaviors is a slow and gradual process," said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. "It takes time." Agha, who was born in Iraq, launched Flip in 2019 alongside cofounder Jonathan Ellman. Like many other founders, Agha is brimming with big ideas. "This was his app, his dream, his world he wanted to create," one former staffer said. Flip's original business idea was a try-before-you-buy social network where customers would receive clothing in the mail, take photos of the fits, and ask other users to vote on which items they should purchase. Fashion tech was in vogue, with apps like Snapchat experimenting with virtual try-on technology. Some entrepreneurs were eyeing China's massive social-shopping industry and considering how they might bring the business to the US. Live-shopping platform Whatnot had just kicked off in the US, later raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a roughly $5 billion valuation. While TikTok hadn't yet launched Shop in the US, it had begun experimenting with e-commerce features like in-video shopping links. By August 2021, when Flip announced its $28 million Series A round, the company had pivoted from try-ons to user-generated product reviews and live shopping videos. Flip was "well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of China and revolutionize social commerce in the US," investor Ullas Naik of Streamlined Ventures said at the time. Flush with cash, the company moved to grow its audience, unveiling a creator program in December 2021 that would pay users commissions on sales generated through their videos. Big social-media stars like Patrick Starrr, Hyram Yarbro, and Addison "Rae" Easterling joined the app. The company was growing quickly, writing in a July 2022 press release that it had expanded its user base by 500% in the first half of that year. Flip fundraised on that growth, announcing in July a $60 million Series B round at a $500 million valuation. That same year, the company moved into a new three-floor office in the El Segundo neighborhood of LA. The office had many of the markers of a buzzy tech startup. Workers had access to free coffee and snacks like Uncrustables. There was even a trampoline, which no one used, three former employees said. Music blared over the speakers, with one electronic track on repeat that Agha particularly enjoyed, three ex-staffers said. "The vibes in the building were always high energy," a third ex-employee said. While the company said it planned to use its 2022 funding to expand its team, it generally kept its head count lean. Much of the company worked in its El Segundo headquarters, where it required staffers to be in person five days a week. Some workers in functions like data entry were asked to work six days a week, with overtime pay. "It was a very intense startup vibe," said the first ex-staffer. "The people that work here are fully bought in." To keep growing in 2023, the company splurged on referrals, offering in-app credits sometimes worth over $100 to get new users signed up and scrolling more, The Information and The Free Press reported. In April 2024, Flip raised a $144 million round with participation from the adtech firm AppLovin, doubling its valuation to around $1.1 billion. A couple of months earlier, it had formed a partnership with AppLovin to power ads for brands on Flip. Around the time of the investment, the company also acquired Curated, a platform that connected shoppers with experts for advice on big purchases, for $330 million in stock. Curated's CEO at the time, Vivas, became Flip's chief operating officer. Vivas, a serial entrepreneur and high school dropout who previously sold a startup to LinkedIn, was on AppLovin's board of directors. The company was racing to expand Flip's user base as it sought to take on the industry's goliath: TikTok Shop. Like social-shopping competitor LTK, the company believed it had to expand beyond pure shopping content. Flip launched a new set of non-shopping videos, called Clips, in July 2024. "We think of shopping as a form of entertainment," Vivas told Business Insider in January. "People do it to have fun and enjoy themselves, but a feed cannot just be shopping content." Riding off the tailwinds of the looming TikTok ban, Flip downloads spiked. The company also invested in a stream of ads on TikTok to lure creators. Inside the company, staffers saw the surge of new users as a breakthrough moment. "We all thought it was going to take off from there," the first former Flip employee said. There was a feeling that "we made it past all of the hard parts of being a startup," they said. To boost non-shopping content, Flip pledged $100 million to its "Founding Creators Fund." It promised creators "grants" of up to $100,000 that would scale with Flip's valuation — so long as the creators kept posting to the app. Contracts set a five-year timeline for payouts, unless an acquisition triggered them earlier. Overall, a mix of user acquisition costs and macroeconomic headwinds stunted Flip's push to take on TikTok Shop. "It was ultimately just unsustainable because they had these very high customer acquisition costs as well as customer retention costs," Canaves said. And as Trump delayed the TikTok ban multiple times, the desperate hunt for an alternative lost its urgency. "It is really challenging for new apps to break through," Canaves said. "I think they struggled to scale in the way that they wanted to." Flip wrote on its website last month that its mission of building a "social platform that gave everyone a voice" had come to a close. It said it had reached 16.5 million people, crossed 5 billion video views, paid $13.4 million to creators, and driven $375 million in sales for brands. The statement didn't provide a reason for the closure. The app's shuttering caught some brand partners off guard. Haak Wear, a hat seller, addressed the Flip shutdown in a blog post on its website. "This situation has reminded us of the importance of having multiple touchpoints with our community," the company wrote. Five former staffers said they felt out of the loop on the health of the business while working at Flip. Flip is not the only tech platform to make big promises to partners and then shut its doors. Buzzy shopping app Nate abruptly closed its creator program in December 2022, for example. "It wasn't surprising that the app was going to shut down at some point," said Tara Blair Ball, a creator in Flip's Founding Creator Fund. "I don't think it made sense how they were making money to warrant the pay that they were giving." Even as Flip's downloads were surging in January, Agha acknowledged that merging social media with commerce is challenging in the US market. "It's definitely crazy freaking hard," Agha said during the January interview. "Almost killed us a thousand times. No question." Have a tip?
