Things aren't so good for Good Clean Goop. Less than two years after it launched, Good Clean Goop — the accessible product line from Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand — is shutting down, a company spokesperson confirmed. The line's relationship with Target, its exclusive brick-and-mortar retailer, ended earlier this year. Both the retailer and Goop declined to provide further details about the line's performance. The line launched in 2023 at Target and on Amazon, and boasted about a dozen products, all under $40 — a far cry from the costly products, like a $150 peptide serum, that Goop had become known for. "I'm so excited for more people who are curious about clean beauty — or who simply appreciate a quality cream or a hardworking cleanser — to be able to try our new line of essentials," Paltrow said in a statement ahead of the line's launch. Some products remain available for purchase on Amazon, though more than half are discounted. "Good.clean.goop introduced many new customers to the goop brand," a Goop spokesperson said in a statement. They described it as "part of a broader strategic shift, focusing on its core business and upcoming initiatives where we're seeing significant momentum." There were signs that the line struggled to gain traction. Last year, Puck reported that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target, and two former Goop employees told Business Insider that they expected the partnership to end in early 2025. The brand's Instagram profile has not posted since October 2024. In June, Goop attempted another strategy to reach the masses: partnering with Ulta Beauty to sell its primary beauty line, Goop Beauty, both on Ulta.com and in 800 stores. Paltrow told WWD last month that beauty was the brand's primary revenue driver. Since its 2008 founding, Goop, which has raised about $140 million according to PitchBook, has made several pivots. Goop launched as a media company, though it has since made significant cuts to its editorial staff and folded its magazine. The brand tried its hand at developing books and TV shows, including a Netflix docuseries, but hasn't released any such projects since 2023. A push into the wellness space with a supplement regimen, which the company said generated $100,000 in sales in one day in 2017, did not last, and other initiatives, like the cruise Goop at Sea, have also shut down. In 2024, the company underwent two rounds of layoffs and remained unprofitable, as Business Insider previously reported. Last year, Goop said that it would focus on beauty, fashion, and food moving forward. Jump to

The Legend of Lara Croft is produced by Legendary TV and produced by Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson and Mike Goldberg, who are also behind the Sonic the Hedgehog film series. Noah Hughes from Crystal Dynamics is an executive producer on the show. This news comes just a day after Amazon MGM Studios announced that Sophie Turner will star in a Tomb Raider TV series from Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As for the game series, Crystal Dynamics is currently at work on the next Tomb Raider game--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard! Log in to comment

Title: I'm a Gen Xer who's been looking for full-time work for 18 months. After more than 1,000 apps, I'm trying to reinvent myself.

Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert Poe, a 56-year-old former e-commerce director. His identity and former employment have been verified. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career at IBM in digital marketing. My brother used to say to me, "You're always going to have a job." I've been through layoffs and worked at companies that shut down, but I never really had to look for a job in my role. My last position was as director of e-commerce at Badcock Home Furniture. I made $120,000 as my base salary. The company was eventually bought by a company that filed for bankruptcy. I lasted about six months in a new role that I landed. I wasn't worried about finding another job. But that was a year and a half ago. Since then, I've sent out over 1,000 résumés. The experience has been a shock. My wife and I sold our house and moved into an apartment. We've had to claim bankruptcy. I sold my car. We're partially living off of our sons' Social Security and my wife's job. Our daughter, who lives with us, helps pay rent. I pretty much have given up on finding e-commerce director roles. I guess I'm too old. I hear a lot of people saying, "Go start your own business," and "This is the time to reinvent yourself." So at 56, that's what I'm trying to do. I got my real estate license and tried that for a little. I was commuting about an hour each way to sit in an office with a bunch of 20-year-olds, doing exactly what I could have done at home. At some point, I realized that it's not realistic to work off strict commissions and commute to an office when nothing is coming in. So I tried out being an Amazon delivery worker for five months. I'm in shape and I work out. But at the end of the night, I couldn't walk up the stairs. It's a different world, especially when you're not used to being spoken to that way. It's a great side gig if you want some extra money, but it's not enough to live on. In addition to the gig work stuff, I've tried to be entrepreneurial. I launched a digital marketing startup called JBP Media Group with a partner who used to work with me. It will be another six months before any income comes in and I've had money come out of my pocket just to get it going. We've gotten a handful of clients, which is wonderful, and we have some employees offshore to help with some of the work. But when clients pay you $200 a month, you need a lot of those small clients. I've also published a book. I have two 20-year-old twin sons with special needs, and the book is about the expenses that hit special needs families. There are probably around $60,000 a year in expenses per kid, including transportation and insurance. Publishing the book has been a bucket list type of thing, and it's one that keeps your mind going. Starting a company has also kept me busy. Even if I'm working technically for free, it keeps my skills sharp. I keep trying everything on top of interviewing, thinking that something will hit. In the meantime, I have to keep going. I have been putting out about two to five résumés a day. I've met with tons of recruiters and have relationships with some of them. But a recruiter will ask to schedule a call and then never get back to me. I'm hearing more and more of that happening, where you get through an interview round and they put the job on hold or find someone internally. It's depressing. Everybody's saying, "LinkedIn's not the place to be anymore" or "You have to make your résumé different." It's incredibly confusing. It's like they flipped a switch overnight. The system's broken. For Gen X folks, it feels like if you're out of a job, then it's just too bad. Right now, I feel like a failure. But my message to other people is that something will work out, even if you have to go from a six-figure job to making $50,000 a year. For me now, I want to work for the Special Olympics, where I volunteer and coach paddleboarding. Even if it's a pay cut, I can start over, and we'll figure it out. Have you struggled to find a job? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or through the secure messaging app Signal at aalt.19. Jump to

Title: Crystal Dynamics’ and Amazon MGM’s Tomb Raider TV Series Casts Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, Filming Kicks Off in 2026

The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from Variety. This is the same series that was announced in May 2024 with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films. "I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…" For Turner's part, she added that she is "thrilled beyond measure" to be stepping into the role. "She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking." It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio confirmed layoffs last week, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "unaffected," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.

Title: Stop Using Brave Browser
URL: https://www.spacebar.news/stop-using-brave-browser/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T17:24:31Z

Seriously. The Brave web browser has carved out a niche over the past few years as an alternative to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other mainstream web browsers. Some of that has come from its marketing as a privacy-preserving web browser, and it has also been repeatedly evangelized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. If someone recommends Brave to you, you should ignore them, because they are wrong. Brave Browser is a mess of a software project, and the company building it is even worse. Brave Software, the company behind the browser of the same name, was founded by Brendan Eich. He's best known as the creator of JavaScript from his days at Netscape Communications, and he was later the co-founder of Mozilla. He remained at Mozilla Foundation and its for-profit segment, Mozilla Corporation, well into the 2000s. In 2014, he was appointed as CEO of Mozilla Corporation, which immediately caused backlash from at least a few people inside Mozilla and many people outside the organization. Why was appointing Eich as CEO so controversial? It's because he donated $1,000 in support of California's Proposition 8 in 2008, which was a proposed amendment to California's state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Eich wrote a blog post defending himself in 2012, when the donation was initially discovered, where did not apologize and denied the donation made him a bigot: In other words, because he silently donated to causes seeking to strip rights from minority groups instead of directly harassing them, the outrage was unjustified. Okay, Brendan. The appointment was a full-on PR disaster for Mozilla, and as an example of how far-reaching the criticism became, OkCupid started showing a popup to its Firefox visitors about the donations and suggested switching to another browser. Brendan Eich quit after 11 days as CEO. He then went on to create Brave Software and obtain $2.5 million in early funding by late 2015, then another $4.5 million by mid-2016. Here's a bonus fun fact: one of those early investors was Founders Fund, which is operated by billionaire Peter Thiel. He's a regular campaign donor to far-right political candidates, and said in an essay that "I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible." He also keeps funding libertarian “seasteading” ships designed to function as independent cities in international waters (think BioShock), all of which have failed miserably. Targeted advertisements can be incredibly damaging to online privacy, because most of them rely on ad networks that purchase or quietly monitor your online behavior to serve personalized ads. That has given ad blockers a dual mandate — they make the web less annoying (at the expense of web revenue), and protect your privacy online. The advertising industry is fighting back with increasingly-complicated detection methods for ad blockers, but as of right now, it’s still a cat-and-mouse battle. From the start, Brave Software had a different idea than just blocking ads outright. The initial version of Brave allowed some advertisements hosted by the site itself (e.g. pre-roll ads on YouTube), and had a long-term goal of building its own advertising network. Here’s what Brendan Eich said in 2016: Brave’s plan was to remove most of the third-party advertisements in a page, create its own ad units based on data collected by the web browser itself, and then split the revenue with publishers. Brave said originally that it was aiming for at least 55% of the money to go to the publisher, with the eventual goal of giving 70% of the revenue to the publisher. The web browser user would also receive a cut. The Newspaper Association of America responded with cease-and-desist letter to Brave Software, calling the ad replacements “blatantly illegal” and insisting it amounted to “republication” of copyrighted content. Brad Flora, who was previously Director of Business Development at Brave, said this never ended up happening: Brave started a 1,000-user trial of its advertising network in 2018. The program rewarded Brave users with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), based on how long they spent viewing ads and content, which would then be kept in a digital wallet or given to publishers as a sort of tipping system. That system hasn’t significantly changed since then, but some of the ad formats are different now. Brave’s website explains that the ads are served in search results in Brave Search, the New Tab page, the Brave News newsfeed, and notifications. BAT is a cryptocurrency. That means its value is highly volatile, and the initial coin offering (ICO) generated another $35 million for Brave in 2017. Brave users can’t redeem BAT for actual (fiat) money without first transferring it to another cryptocurrency wallet, and publishers/content creators are also paid in BAT. There’s an option for publishers/content creators to automatically convert the tokens earned into real money, but again, the value of BAT changes constantly. Brave’s replacement for ads doesn’t reward users in a meaningful amount (reports in 2021 were around 2-6 BAT per month, which is $0.40-$1.25 on the current exchange rate), and requires publishers and content creators to jump through additional hoops to reclaim lost revenue from ad blockers. If the goal was to create a more fair payment system for content on the web, it has largely failed. It has generated a lot of revenue for Brave, though, so that’s nice. Brave’s BAT was built around the cryptocurrency ecosystem (it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain), which helped it attract users from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts. Brave Software continued to bake in more crypto-adjacent functionality over time, billing itself as the ultimate browser for crypto and web 3.0. A full crypto wallet was added in 2021, replacing the original wallet built around BAT. It supports live and historical market graphs, sending and receiving crypto, managing NFTs, and interacting with decentralized apps (Dapps). The past year has revealed how most of this ecosystem was built on overvalued startups, hype, and outright scams. Here are some of the companies, individuals, and organizations that Brave has worked with in the crypto industry: Brave was also caught up in a privacy scandal in 2020, when it was revealed that the browser was adding affiliate codes to some URLs typed into the address bar. For example, typing in “binance.us” would add Brave’s affiliate link to the end, allowing Brave Software to collect revenue from signups or purchases. An official blog post called that “a mistake,” and the functionality was later turned off. That should have been enough to swear off Brave as a privacy-centric browser forever, considering the entire point of affiliate links is to collect data about the user and traffic source. For example, when you click an Amazon affiliate link in a web article, the publisher can see the exact products you purchase in the timeframe the tracking cookie remains active (which is currently 24 hours). Brave's defenders will point to the revenue sources for other browsers as something similar to Brave's URL replacement experiment. Vivaldi adds sponsored bookmarks on the new tab page, for example. However, I’m not aware of another browser ever rewriting what the user types in the address bar. Ultimately, Brave Browser is the apparatus of an advertising company, a bloated and complicated experience for the average user, and the pet project of the person kicked out of Mozilla for continuing to defend harmful political donations. If you want a privacy-focused web browser, use Firefox or Vivaldi. If you want to support your favorite content creators and publishers, turn on advertisements or support them through the methods they already support (Patreon, Ko-Fi, and so on). Brave Browser is irredeemable, and you should not use it under any circumstances. Tech companies wanted "AI" to represent a bright future. Now it represents every annoyance in our daily lives. Servo was supposed to be Firefox's future. Now it's an independent effort to make a fast and secure web browser engine. FireWire, the Newton PDA, and other technologies from Apple's past are still hiding in macOS. You can download videos and audio as MP3, M4A, OGG, or other audio formats with the yt-dlp command line tool. An inside look at the technology around us.

By Eddie Makuch on September 3, 2025 at 10:37AM PDT Amazon MGM Studios has announced that Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner will indeed play the role of Lara Croft in an upcoming Tomb Raider series. A previous report said Turner had dropped out and the show itself was "dead." Variety and others confirmed the news today that the Tomb Raider TV series is moving ahead. Additionally, Amazon MGM Studios confirmed that filming will begin in January 2026. As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, and executive producer for the series, with Chad Hodge (Single All the Way, Wayward Pines) joining as co-showrunner and executive producer. Shogun director Jonathan van Tulleken has also come aboard as executive producer and director. Waller-Bridge said in a statement, "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out ... Croft is coming ..." Before Turner, the actors Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander brought the character Lara Croft to life in film. For her part, Turner said she is "thrilled beyond measure" to play Croft. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking," she said. The Tomb Raider series for Prime Video was greenlit under the leadership of Amazon MGM Studios boss Jennifer Salke, but Salke exited the company earlier this year amid reports of a power struggle. Salke was said to be personally overseeing the Tomb Raider series. Matthew Belloni of Puck reported in March that the Tomb Raider series went through multiple writers rooms, with "tens of millions" spent on development costs. In addition to producing the TV series, Amazon is publishing the next Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. This new game was never expected to be connected to the TV series. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

September 02, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Noakes: Sell the U.S. Postal Service to UPS
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/02/noakes-sell-the-u-s-postal-service-to-ups/

Since its introduction in 1775, the U.S. Postal Service has played a vital role in American history. Recent headlines have underscored the urgency of reform. USPS recently requested a rate hike for stamps and mail services, its sixth price increase in less than five years, placing a heavier burden on consumers while still operating at a multi-billion dollar loss. In contrast, the United Parcel Service has proven itself a leader in safe and effective delivery of mail and goods, as well as the logistics behind the international transportation and delivery management industry. In a world of an ever-changing economy, the shift toward privatization proves compelling because of its relation to market competition and public choice theories. The USPS has been operating at a net loss for decades. According to a Government Accountability Office report in 2021, the USPS has incurred more than $87 billion in losses since 2007. These losses have primarily been driven by its inability to adapt to various climates and conditions. With increased usage of online mail in the past decade, the USPS has seen a significant drop in first-class mail. In 2020, it delivered half as much first-class mail as in 2001. Private companies such as UPS and FedEx have dominated the industry in new shipping standards. The USPS primarily uses its vehicles and contracted air, rail, truck, and ground services. Concerns are growing over its ability to serve rural areas and keep up with urban delivery demand. Meanwhile, private companies have ramped up quick access to deliveries. In 2021, the USPS announced it would slow delivery times for certain first-class mail and periodicals as part of its “Delivering for America” plan, affecting 40% of first-class mail. Though intended to cut costs, this instead alienated what remained of a loyal customer base. Its failure to modernize, along with market competition, shows the USPS should be privatized, promoting growth through private firms’ ability to thrive in environments that demand transportation efficiency and immediacy. Two private companies dominate: UPS and FedEx. Both have grown across international markets and created strong union jobs, contributing to economic growth through faster shipping and receiving. UPS, in particular, generated $100.3 billion in revenue in 2023, making it one of the largest delivery companies worldwide. In comparison, the USPS earned $81.9 billion and operated at a loss of $4.9 billion, while UPS posted a $13.1 billion profit. This is mainly because UPS has adapted to all terrain types, ensuring fast and reliable service. UPS operates the second-largest cargo airline in the world, with 570 aircraft, allowing it to streamline shipping. USPS, by contrast, relies on contracted and commercial carriers, a less efficient model. UPS regularly rolls out innovations like battery-powered bikes in New York City and four-wheel-drive pickups for rural routes. These examples highlight a significant difference between USPS and UPS: adaptability that reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction and creates a competitive advantage. Even as UPS continues to navigate a challenging economic environment, it continues to demonstrate strategic leadership. In its first-quarter earnings report, UPS announced a reduction in its workforce of 20,000 in addition to the closure of 73 buildings. In return, this will save the company $3.5 billion, allowing UPS to come out on top of a shifting economy and competitive industry. While critics may view these cuts skeptically, CEO Carol Tomé emphasized they are part of UPS’s effort to become “more nimble” in a shifting global market. UPS has also announced it is realigning its operations after scaling back business with Amazon, once a major client, while still reporting U.S. revenue growth of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2024. Each of these moves has demonstrated a disciplined commitment to operational efficiency. In contrast, the USPS continues to see a steady decline in optimization. Public Choice Theory, which studies political behavior through economic principles, offers context for this decision. It suggests that political actors — senators, dignitaries, etc. — are often driven by self-interest. A politician may push a popular policy to help re-election, not because it’s best for the economy. This theory also addresses government failure — the idea that public institutions like USPS underperform because they don’t face private-sector competition. USPS’s continued losses support this argument. Together, these elements show USPS’s vulnerability to inefficiency, making privatization the more logical path forward. There are, however, a few counterarguments worth addressing. First is the fear of a monopoly. USPS, UPS, FedEx and Amazon make up the leading shipping players. Removing USPS could leave only three, risking market dominance by one if another fails. This could bring the United States back to a scenario reminiscent of the Gilded Age, when a few companies controlled entire markets. To avoid this, the sale of USPS would require oversight. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division would step in to ensure continued market diversity. Unionization is another concern. USPS employees are represented by the American Postal Workers Union, while UPS workers are mainly backed by the Teamsters. Amazon is only partly unionized, and FedEx has little to no union support. The USPS union supports 200,000 members; the UPS Teamsters represent 330,000. A merger could lead to layoffs, as UPS might inherit the USPS volume but not need as many workers. Union leaders and employees would understandably oppose this. Still, a USPS sale could spark more competition. UPS, FedEx and Amazon would fight harder for market share, leading to faster deliveries, lower costs and better service. One could argue this walks a fine line between monopolistic consolidation and competitive expansion. Still, the data speaks for itself: UPS has and will continue to innovate ahead of its competitors. Recent elections have shown Americans demand efficiency and accountability from government institutions, and it is time to apply free-market solutions that reward innovation and responsible management.

Title: Want to avoid burnout? Just hire an 'executive function' coach
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/avoid-burnout-hire-executive-functioning-coach-adhd-white-collar-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-01T08:11:02Z

In 2022, Sage Quiamno was in her early 30s and a few months into a demanding DEI leadership role at Amazon when she hit a wall. Cycles of feeling overwhelmed, procrastination, and frantic catch-up were routinely stretching her already long workdays past the 12-hour mark. Burnout was on the horizon. She knew she needed to make a change, fast. Quiamno found the support she needed from a life coach with unconventional tactics. Unlike many coaches, who guide clients toward overarching personal or professional goals, Quiamno's coach — whom she came to call an "executive function coach" — focused on helping develop skills to better manage her thoughts, actions, and emotions, optimizing her time and energy. Instead of applying an organizational blueprint to her work life, her coach zoomed in on specific pain points like task management and procrastination, helping her build strategies to confront the habits and feelings that were getting in her way. Three years later, Quiamno, who is now 34 and living in Seattle, still meets one-on-one with her coach every other week, in addition to a monthly meeting with a group of other women who are also focused on honing their executive functioning. "This is a long-term investment," Quiamno tells me. Executive function is the blanket term for assorted cognitive skills that help with organization, focus, memory, and self-control. It's the toolkit that lets you plan a multistep project at work and then deliver it on deadline, or navigate conflict with a friend. Harvard researchers have called it the brain's "air traffic control system." Impaired executive function has historically been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. That's beginning to change. In the past few years, growing numbers of parents, teachers, and universities have enlisted executive function specialists to help stressed-out students get things done, regardless of whether those students have a psychiatric diagnosis. And now, anxious and overworked professionals are turning to the very same coaches to recoup some semblance of control — and a slew of workplace coaching companies, such as BetterUp and WorkSmart, have taken note and started folding "executive function" into their rhetoric. The trend underscores how, in our age of constant digital distractions, our attention spans and time-management skills just aren't what they used to be. It also points to much larger problems in the way we live and work today. Executive function coaching was virtually synonymous with ADHD when it entered the fore in the mid-2000s. It quickly showed promise. In a 2009 study published in the journal Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, college students with ADHD or impaired learning received one-on-one coaching for 10 weeks, focusing on building perseverance, motivation, impulse control, and other executive functioning challenges. Afterward, the students reported greater autonomy and goal achievement, reduced anxiety, and stronger self-regulation. It wasn't until much more recently that executive function coaching went mainstream. Jesse Ruderman, the executive functioning specialist for the University of Denver's Learning Effectiveness Program, tells me the university hired its first executive function coach in the spring of 2020 to support students who were struggling amid COVID lockdowns. Other higher-ed institutions, such as the University of Minnesota, George Mason University, and Oberlin College, have since implemented similar programs. The pandemic was a turning point for workers, too. J. Russell Ramsay, a clinical psychologist who's a cofounder of the University of Pennsylvania's Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program, explains that the COVID lockdowns heavily taxed many adults' executive functioning because they removed the "scaffolding" of structured workplace environments that helped designate start and end times. Many people who were previously "struggling but getting by" with undiagnosed ADHD suddenly found themselves unable to cope, Ramsay says. The pandemic also exposed executive functioning vulnerabilities in people who might not meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD but "have many of the symptoms." Not coincidentally, the pandemic saw a major spike in the number of adults in the US diagnosed with ADHD and being prescribed medications to treat it. A 2024 JAMA study found that between April 2020 and March 2022, nonstimulant ADHD prescriptions jumped by 81% among 20- to 39-year-olds, while Adderall and other stimulants rose by 30%. A separate analysis found that between 2019 and 2023, medical claims for ADHD grew by 101% among 18- to 44-year-olds, 70% among 45- to 64-year-olds, and 60% among adults over 65. The end of lockdown did not, however, make people's struggles go away. Since joining the University of Denver as a coach in 2022, Ruderman reports seeing "significant" year-over-year increases in students seeking his help. He met with 391 unique students in the 2023-24 academic year; last year, that number leaped to 727. He attributes at least some of the jump to the TikTokification of mental health — specifically, a widening pool of content creators who focus on neurodiversity — which has made a lot more people familiar with concepts like executive function. Ruderman says he's had to shorten his appointment time slots to accommodate rising demand. A sudden expansion of executive functioning support for workers suggests the corporate world has seen a similar pattern. Kate Broeking, an executive-functioning-focused workplace coach in Seattle, says that in just the past year, she's noticed more employee assistance programs and coaching companies that explicitly address executive functioning. Some employers, such as Workday, Chevron, and WarnerMedia, are even making these services available to their entire staff as a workplace benefit. Broeking has seen an influx of individual clients in her own coaching practice as well. Why the continued surge in executive dysfunction? The short answer is that modern life is stretching everyone's mental capacity to the brink. The experts I spoke with point to the endless interruptions and cheap dopamine hits of our digital devices as one obvious culprit. Research suggests that the digital world can warp our perception of time, which would logically affect how well we manage it. All the while, the increase in ADHD diagnoses has made more people aware of what executive functioning is in the first place. "The term has become quite prevalent," Ruderman says, noting that people have begun talking about executive dysfunction on TikTok. That prevalence has fed broader self-recognition. "It's really easy to self-diagnose — to identify that one has perhaps some executive dysfunction," he adds. On top of everything else, the pandemic introduced a new age of employment uncertainty that has far from let up. In some key respects, it's only gotten worse. Over the past few years, common wisdom about how to achieve success and security has largely flown out the window. Highly educated domain experts, new MBA holders, and freshly minted Ivy League graduates are among the millions of Americans struggling to land jobs, and the country isn't even in a recession. The tech industry is now in its fourth consecutive year of sweeping layoffs across every level of the corporate hierarchy. Generative AI has destabilized entire white-collar career trajectories, already prompting some employers to reduce head count on the so-far unsubstantiated promise of human-caliber automation. All the while, students and workers face mounting pressure to accomplish more and better with less time and support. "Humans don't like uncertainty," Ramsay says, adding that people with executive functioning challenges tend to like it even less. That's because living with unpredictable focus and feelings can create a lot of self-doubt, which makes external ambiguity even tougher to tolerate. But a heightened sense of uncertainty can also inhibit executive function, even in those who otherwise thrive under pressure. In an era when an ever-increasing slew of distractors constantly threaten executive functioning in work and school — not to mention side hustles, extracurriculars, caregiving duties, and the basics of being human — this vicious cycle can be catastrophic for people's well-being. For employers, poor executive functioning can also be expensive. Chronic stress and feeling overwhelmed are known risk factors for burnout, which drives up sick leave and lowers engagement in workers. New research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the fallout adds up to $4,000 to $21,000 per employee each year — a $5 million annual price tag for the average 1,000-employee company in the US. And employee leaves of absence appear to have been on the rise. In a 2024 survey by AbsenceSoft, a leave-of-absence software provider, 57% of HR managers reported increased employee leave requests over the past year — the third year in a row that the majority reported an increase. While most workers cited illness or injury as the reason for their absence, nearly half named mental health challenges. Perhaps relatedly, a May 2025 analysis of Glassdoor postings found that employee discussions of burnout were at their highest since 2016, showing a 32% increase from last year. Many workers seem to be hanging on by a thread. Although anyone can fall prey to burnout, research suggests workers with ADHD, autism, and other neurodevelopmental disorders may be especially susceptible. Some companies made strides to bridge these gaps in the years leading up to the pandemic, designing targeted well-being programs that could function as reasonable accommodations for employees with relevant ADA-qualifying diagnoses. Broeking, the work coach in Seattle, led the charge in building Amazon's work wellness coaching program in 2018 before going on to help Microsoft and Google establish similar coaching programs of their own. These interventions were modeled on vocational rehabilitation programs — services designed to help workers with disabilities find and keep jobs — and focused largely on executive function skill-building to boost worker engagement and prevent medical leaves of absence. In larger companies, Broeking worked with as many as 300 employees a year. Workplace wellness initiatives, however, aren't a silver bullet. A 2024 article in Harvard Business Review pointed out that while nearly 85% of major US employers offered wellness programs, worker burnout showed no sign of slowing down. Among other reasons, the authors suggest that well-being programs fall short by focusing on individual outcomes instead of the organizational causes often at the root of employees' distress. Workers want work-life balance and flexibility, clear goals, and consistent metrics for charting progress; research shows that organizations see improved employee health and output when they implement structural changes that better support those needs. Although personalized executive functioning guidance isn't a cure-all, workers still stand to benefit from it. "It doesn't take too much to knock us off track, and executive functioning means knowing how to shield yourself from distractions," Ramsay says. He's writing a book in which he recommends that employers provide executive functioning support for all staff, which he argues would be an asset to everyone — not only those with official diagnoses. Coaching may prove especially handy for navigating the tides of change and uncertainty that now define many workers' reality. When Amazon rolled back DEI programming early this year, Quiamno — the former DEI leader and coaching client — found herself back at the drawing board for her professional road map. She knew she couldn't rely on an employer to steward her career development; she would have to do it herself. Quiamno, who now runs her own consulting business for women-led startups, credits coaching for helping her build the confidence to move forward. "With a one-on-one coach who knows your strengths and your blind spots, there's always something new to learn," she says. "It's an accountability mechanism — a commitment to myself and my growth as a leader." Kelli María Korducki is a journalist whose work focuses on work, tech, and culture.

Title: A former Microsoft worker has been job-hunting for 9 months. He says it feels like companies are 'looking for Superman.'

Before he was fired last December, Mody Khan was earning a six-figure salary as a cloud solution architect at Microsoft. Nine months into his job search, he's at risk of losing his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. "I'm in a very tight spot." A new job could stabilize his finances — but despite a five-year run at Microsoft and his prior experience in the tech industry, even landing interviews has been challenging. "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman," he said. Khan is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've lost their jobs over the past year. In recent years, Big Tech firms — including Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon — have revamped their performance review and compensation systems to better reward top performers and weed out underperformers in pursuit of smaller, higher-performing teams. Then there are the layoffs. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. The cuts have also affected many individual contributor roles. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart are among the companies that have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers in a trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the beginning of this year, global tech companies have laid off more than 80,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have come amid a white-collar hiring slowdown. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," Khan said. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Khan said that after immigrating to the US from Pakistan in 2007, he struggled to find high-paying work during the 2008 recession. But over time, his job prospects improved — and he held various tech roles before joining Microsoft in July 2019 as a contract support engineer. He became a full-time employee in May 2020, working as a support escalation engineer. In December 2021, he was promoted to cloud solution architect — a fully remote role he held until his termination in December 2024. Khan's final years at the company were very difficult. He said multiple managers raised concerns about his performance over the years and eventually warned him that his job was in jeopardy. While he made efforts to improve, he said that it didn't seem to make a difference — and that he believes his managers didn't give him the support he needed to succeed. He said he often lacked clear guidance on expectations and would have benefited from more constructive feedback and coaching. At times, he said, it felt like his managers were more focused on "building a case" against him than helping him improve. At one point, he told his wife that if he ever won even a small lottery jackpot, he'd walk away. The pressure had become too much. "I hated going from the bedroom to my home office," he said. "I was under so much stress." Last December, Khan learned he was being fired for performance reasons and wouldn't be receiving severance pay. He was told he could still apply for other roles at Microsoft — and said he later applied to as many as 30 internal positions — but never received an offer. Khan said he sold some of his Microsoft stock holdings but now has only about $10,000 in "survival money" left in his bank account — enough to last him and his wife about two more months. If that runs out, they'd be forced to tap into his remaining investments or 401(k). To make matters worse, they fell behind on their mortgage payments — and if they can't resume payments once their forbearance plan ends in November, they could face foreclosure. The financial toll has also caused his credit score to drop from the high 600s into the 500s in just a few months. Since expanding his search outside Microsoft, Khan has managed to land some interviews, he said, but no matter how well they seem to go, none have led to offers. "I've had so many good interviews where I'm ready for them to say, 'Mody, let's rock 'n' roll' — and then they don't move forward," he said. He added that it's particularly frustrating when seemingly promising conversations with recruiters don't end in a clear rejection — but in silence, leaving him unsure whether he was ever truly considered. "Recruiters contact me, take my résumé, and they ghost me," he said. Khan believes a few factors may be hindering his job search. He's concerned that some employers assume, because of his age, that he's not up to date on the latest technologies. He said that to push back on that perception, he completed an AI certification through the University of Texas. He added that many of his interviewers appeared to be looking for candidates with startup backgrounds, which made him feel like his experience at a tech giant was almost a strike against him. Additionally, he said he believes his Pakistani background has, at times, been an obstacle. He believes some Indian recruiters or interviewers may carry biases that surface during the hiring process, particularly given long-standing regional and political tensions between India and Pakistan. Khan said he continues to apply to roles every week, hoping that one will finally come through. But with the financial pressure mounting and his savings running low, he said the stakes are getting higher. "It's a very, very dangerous situation," he said. Jump to

Title: AI isn’t coming for your job, says Trump labor boss, but it’s here to stay

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer says the robots aren’t coming for your paycheck — and she’s betting big that artificial intelligence will make more Americans upwardly mobile, not unemployed. In a Fox Business interview airing Labor Day weekend, the Oregon Republican-turned-cabinet-chief dismissed anxiety about mass layoffs as AI spreads from factory floors to office cubicles. “There should be no threat of AI displacing the American worker,” Chavez-DeRemer told Fox Business. “What we’re hearing on the ground is AI is here to stay,” she added. “The President wants the United States to be the leader in AI, to win that AI race.” The rosy portrait comes as corporate executives have warned that AI will likely reduce employment rolls in key white collar fields — with some doomsayers predicting a bloodbath of mass layoffs. Chavez-DeRemer, confirmed in March with bipartisan support, argued AI will take the drudgery out of tasks and help workers reach higher-pay roles supervising and operating the new tech. “I’ve been through companies where AI is assisting the American worker,” she said, describing a plant that replaced manual carbon-fiber coiling with 3-D printing. “Now those workers are reskilled and upskilled, and now they’re running the line.” The secretary’s rosy outlook comes as the administration rolls out an aggressive pro-AI agenda that seeks to assert US dominance in the technology, while keeping Main Street on board.

In April, President Trump signed an executive order making “AI literacy and proficiency” a national priority, directing agencies to seed K-12 classrooms, teacher training and apprenticeships with AI content and to expand pathways for lifelong learners. The White House followed in July with “America’s AI Action Plan,” which casts American workers as the policy’s center of gravity and tees up new measures to track AI’s labor-market impact, expand apprenticeships and stand up an “AI Workforce Research Hub” at the Labor Department. Last week, the Labor Department issued guidance urging states to use federal funding for AI-skills training — from prompting and evaluating AI outputs to basic cybersecurity tied to responsible use. The memo explicitly ties the push to the April executive order and spells out how youth, adult and dislocated-worker programs can weave AI into short-term classes, credentials and work-based learning. Leading tech and business figures have been sounding alarms that AI could wipe out up to half of all white-collar jobs within just a few years, with CEOs from Anthropic, Ford, Amazon and others openly bracing for mass cuts. Experts like Dario Amodei and Kai-Fu Lee warn of a looming “white-collar bloodbath,” with entry-level roles in finance, law, consulting and tech especially vulnerable. Former Google chief Eric Schmidt predicts most coding work will soon be done by AI, while Amazon’s Andy Jassy says corporate head-counts will shrink as efficiency improves. The IMF estimates 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted, urging governments to pour resources into retraining to cushion the blow. Even AI champions like Sam Altman admit that “jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” warning that the transition will be painful before any new opportunities emerge. One study suggests this could already be happening for entry-level workers, whose skills are the easiest to replicate with AI. Economists found that employment for young software engineers dropped 20% between late 2022 and early 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement

The majority of the early adopters wasted their money chasing the promised la-la world. It took a lot of painful efforts in strategising, governance and change management that finally turned these technologies to deliver the benefits. It looks like Gen-AI projects are in the same situation today. Enterprise boards were quick to embrace it for its transformative power, but the latest findings from MIT’s NANDA initiative reveal a sobering truth: Of the hundreds of deployments surveyed, a mere 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration, while the rest linger in pilot purgatory or total failure. The “GenAI Divide” is real and widening. Why this disheartening pattern? And, more importantly, how can enterprises reverse this? To the experienced eye, the culprits seem obvious: yet-to-mature technology, unclear regulation, or the occasional model hallucination. But the MIT findings suggest the real villain is the flawed integration and huge learning gap. As a general-purpose tool, Gen-AI is great for individual users. For most knowledge workers, platforms like ChatGPT turn productive in content creation, faster search and analysis. But this becomes sort of a liability at scale. They seem to fail to adapt to enterprise workflow and not get attached to proprietary data ecosystems. They miss the finer contextual details to make complex decisions. Therein lies the failure of pilots. * More than half of AI budgets was allocated to sales and marketing tools, and key areas where substantial ROI could be lying were ignored, especially in back-office automation. Imagine how much enterprises would have saved if BPO costs were eliminated or if the reliance on external agencies were eliminated. Even operational excellence could drive better ROI by reducing costs. * Building one’s own solutions succeeds only one-third as often as purchased solutions. Most businesses refuse to believe this and stubbornly pursue in-house development. Partnering with specialised providers makes better sense. * Centralised adoption with innovation teams to drive AI, creates ivory towers. Success correlates strongly with empowering line managers and embedding AI into day-to-day operational decisions. * Employees, starved of sanctioned tools, adopt unsupported solutions like ChatGPT. This leads to compliance and security risks, with governance gaps. Clearly, the evidence is there for enterprises to follow a different playbook and avoid such blunders. (i) Can you anchor AI to one high-stake pain point? Air Canada didn’t deploy Gen-AI for broad marketing tactics but for automating contract review and compliance checks. It found a 60% reduction in legal processing times and delivered measurable cost savings. The few success stories show a common theme: unwavering focus. In contrast, companies that scatter AI budgets across multiple areas without prioritising have seen poor or no impact, leading to scepticism. (ii) Can you first buy or partner and then build? During the COVID-19 vaccine race, Pfizer engaged startups like Concerto HealthAI as partners to use AI in accelerating drug discovery. This buy-and-partner strategy helped in reducing years from research timelines in vaccine discovery using the power of ecosystems. Proprietary AI systems may sound exciting, but when you need a lot of data, going all alone is the loud noise before defeat. Many financial services companies have built proprietary GenAI engines in isolation and ended up halting rollouts and increasing costs, typically associated with the build-it-yourself fallacy. (iii) Can you decentralise rollout to the edges? Unilever has trained SBU heads along with data scientists to identify AI use cases, which resulted in a successful rollout. This way, GenAI was embedded into forecasting and procurement, saving millions in supply chain improvements. AI should not be a cloistered experiment in a central lab. Real transformation occurs when line managers own the integration. A large MNC bank poured resources into its “AI Centre of Excellence” but barred branch managers from influencing pilots, leading to wonderful PoCs that never scaled. (iv) Can you reorganise workflows before AI integration? The shipping liner, Maersk, started with standardising shipping documentation and digitised customs workflows before integrating GenAI for intelligent document processing. This resulted in a 30% reduction in turnaround time at ports. Do not treat AI as a plug-in for processes that are broken. Many e-retailers tend to layer chatbots over chaotic customer service workflows, and this will frustrate both agents and consumers. (v) Can you manage the human angle with foresight? IBM used an attrition-led reskilling model and announced that AI would automate over 7500 roles. It simultaneously invested in upskilling plans for data analytics and AI ethics. By doing both, it contained employee anxieties and kept its brand image of a responsible innovator. In an era when human roles are made redundant, managing panic-driven layoffs is critical and not like the TCS layoffs recently. Mass lay-offs by Meta and Amazon eroded trust and drove talent to competitors, damaging the employer brand. (vi) Can you incorporate governance and metrics? What Microsoft has done with its Copilot for enterprise clients is a case in point. It includes a robust ROI framework, tracking metrics like time-to-task completion and employee satisfaction. This helps in driving AI as a credible performer. Remember the saying, “What cannot be measured cannot be scaled.” Businesses that skirt this issue fake wins, with CFOs questioning the effectiveness of every rupee spent. Tech won’t save you; culture will. The winners? They treat failure like a cheap intern: tolerated, taught, then fired fast. They hype small wins like blockbuster premieres. And Gen-AI? It’s Fool’s Gold – shiny, seductive, yet treacherous. Be reminded: AI won’t replace you, but dumb strategy surely will.
