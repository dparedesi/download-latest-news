Skip to comments. Posted on 11/24/2024 3:42:15 AM PST by Libloather The Washington Post used to be one of the best gigs in journalism. No longer. In a business where it generally sucks to be an employee (except for the NY Post, of course), the ‚ÄúWaPo,‚Äù as it is known in journalism circles, has really descended into the abyss, On The Money has learned. Top reporters want out of what they see as crappy new work conditions and possibly more layoffs coming. It‚Äôs a shame, of course. The paper and its journalists ‚Äî think Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and their dogged pursuit of Watergate ‚Äî set the gold standard for reporting. They are the reason so many went into the business, including yours truly. Sure, Woodward remains at the paper, as do many amazing reporters. But the decline of print as a viable business model, plus the leftward lurch of a new generation of ink-stained wretches that turns off readers, has decimated readership ‚Äî and the paper‚Äôs balance sheet. The Post changed hands years ago from the Graham family to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs richest men, but he hates losing money, people who know him tell On The Money. That includes the tens of millions a year he‚Äôs sinking into the paper. Bezos brought in new management this year like publisher Will Lewis, a WSJ alum (the WSJ and the NY Post share common ownership), to de-woke the place and help it at the very least break even. But it‚Äôs either not working or not working well enough to satisfy Bezos‚Äô desire to stop throwing good money after bad, people close to him say. That‚Äôs why in addition to financial discipline (some recent layoffs, and possibly more in the future), Lewis is demanding some personal discipline as well. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. Cars with a manual transmission now make up a tiny share of autos sold in the US. An updated Porsche 911 Carrera is a reminder of how fun they can be, says BI's chief car reviewer. On the agenda today: But first: Look out, government workers. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. For a minute there, working for the government was in vogue. TikTok videos espoused the benefits of #publicsector jobs, and Google searches for "how to get a government job" hit a five-year high. Younger workers, in particular, were drawn to employment considered less vulnerable to layoffs. Then Elon Musk arrived on the scene. The Department for Government Efficiency, co-headed by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, has outlined plans to slash federal jobs. DOGE will work with agency appointees to find the minimum number of employees required to perform its functions, per the duo. That has some government workers on edge. (You can see where the most federal staffers work and how much they're paid here.) Several careers consultants told Business Insider they were already experiencing a rush of demand from workers ready to shift to the private sector. Laura Labovich, CEO of The Career Strategy Group, told BI that these workers weren't complaining about their promotion prospects or compensation, as they might have in the past. "They just say, 'I want to leave,'" she said. Comcast, one of the biggest cable TV companies in the US, announced plans to split off almost all of its cable TV networks ‚Äî CNBC, MSNBC, USA, and a few digital assets ‚Äî but keep the rest of its media business, including Peacock, NBC, and Bravo. The move further cements the decline of cable, as the number of people paying for and watching these networks is falling every year, BI's Peter Kafka writes. More on the big break up. Also read: By all the standard economic measures, America's labor market looks fine. But ask any white-collar professional, and they'll tell you a horror story that would prove otherwise. Hiring has held up well for low-earning workers, but those making six figures or more are in the midst of a white-collar recession. New data from LinkedIn, which tracked how often its users landed new jobs, shows that tech jobs in particular have been among the hardest hit. More on who's being affected by the hiring slump. Your age probably says a lot about how you remember TGI Fridays. The restaurant chain began as a singles bar in the '60s, and then it evolved into a family-friendly spot in the '80s and '90s. Now, it's a place no one really wants to go. Fridays closed 36 underperforming corporate-owned restaurants at the beginning of the year and recently filed for bankruptcy. Its slow decline and accelerated crash is a familiar story for many restaurant chains. Why casual dining went bust. Amazon's voice assistant became something of a household icon when it launched a decade ago. But maintaining that success has proved difficult. Now, the company is trying to save Alexa with an AI-powered upgrade and improved capabilities. Partnerships with Uber and Ticketmaster were supposed to make Alexa smarter ‚Äî but issues have delayed the upgrade's release. Are you there, Alexa?

Title: Commentary: Stealth firing or ethical dismissal? Why employers terminate staff for minor offences

Commentary Enforcing a hard line on employee conduct could prevent bigger lapses but may prompt claims of disguised cost savings, says Anjli Raval for the Financial Times. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. (Photo: iStock) LONDON: Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy recently told employees that a new plan requiring them to be in the office five days a week did not amount to a ‚Äúbackdoor layoff‚Äù. Yet his reported comments at a company-wide meeting last week did not rebut a previous suggestion from a senior manager that staff who fail to comply could look for work elsewhere. As companies try to rein in costs and restrict workplace initiatives that do not help profits, workers are wary of falling victim to a fresh horror: The stealth sacking. Alongside a string of recent publicly announced mass layoffs ‚Äì by companies including Nissan, Boeing and Citigroup ‚Äì there have been a series of employers quietly justifying smaller-scale dismissals because of seemingly minor violations of company policy. Here the focus is not on the size and scope of redundancy programmes, how humanely managers handled them or whether support or severance pay was offered to affected staff, but on the specific rationale behind the decisions. Facebook owner Meta, for example, sacked about two dozen staff for abusing meal credit vouchers, while EY terminated the employment of a group of workers for watching multiple training videos at once, the Financial Times has reported. Infractions that workers have probably interpreted as minor misdemeanours in the past can now be sackable offences, and may prompt questions about whether cost savings are being disguised. ‚ÄúAs with most stories, there are two sides,‚Äù says Leo Martin, managing director of GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy that helps organisations design, build and improve their ethics and compliance programmes. ‚ÄúFrom the employee perspective they may have been given unrealistic deadlines, excessive work pressures or have received unclear guidance as to what is expected, while the employer will feel that abusing a perk or taking short-cuts undermines their systems, [and that] cheating in an exam or lying about training ‚Ä¶ is a fundamental breach of trust.‚Äù Part of the motivation to take a tough line on employees could be to make an example of anyone deemed to be a rule-breaker. This level of corporate discipline has been more common among heavily regulated industries, such as banking and financial services, that have huge compliance functions and the risk of hefty penalties for any conduct breaches. Amanda Rajkumar, who has held senior human-resources (HR) leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas, says: ‚ÄúBanks and financial services have always come down hard ‚Ä¶ given the robust regulatory environment and strong requirement to demonstrate exemplary, ethical behaviour related to the fiduciary nature of the industry.‚Äù Another incentive for a tough stance is that small infractions, such as taking advantage of company perks or bending minor rules, can foreshadow more serious ethical lapses. This has fuelled a ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù approach to policy enforcement in some sectors, as companies seek to preserve what they see as a culture of integrity. One example from the financial crisis was when Fidelity Investments fired employees for being part of a fantasy football league that went against the company‚Äôs gambling rule. Early this year, several employees at US retailer Target were sacked after they used their status as staff to buy highly coveted Stanley cups ahead of customers. ‚ÄúThe spotlight should be on the employees‚Äô reason or motivation for breaking the rules,‚Äù adds Rajkumar. ‚ÄúA deliberate misuse of company resources usually indicates low engagement or a specific gripe against the firm.‚Äù A recent trend of staff turning to online platforms to vent their frustrations about perceived mistreatment by employers or indiscriminate layoffs has also pushed some companies to recalibrate their approach. Websites such as LinkedIn and anonymous review site, Glassdoor, give workers an outlet for grievances about their bosses, which can then spread quickly and damage the reputation of employers. In one example that went viral this year, Brittany Pietsch, an employee at internet company Cloudflare, recorded her nine-minute virtual meeting with HR representatives in which she was fired, and posted it to TikTok, spawning a new ‚ÄúQuit-Tok‚Äù trend. In the video, Pietsch confronted her seniors about the reasons for her termination, but they had ‚Äúno specific‚Äù answers or ‚Äúclarity‚Äù. Aware that employee complaints about terminations are no longer confined to private HR files, some companies are aiming to reduce backlash and curb reputational risk by emphasising policy-driven grounds for firing. Recruiters, HR heads and workplace experts say whether an employer has made a clear case for dismissal is becoming as important as the manner in which a termination is conducted. ‚ÄúCompanies have had to be more mindful when they are firing staff because people are more vocal. We are in an era where snap decisions can have big blowbacks,‚Äù says Habiba Khatoon, a director at headhunter Robert Walters. She adds that in her experience managers are so wary of dismissing workers out of turn that they are delaying action until a record has been built of repeated performance issues or behaviour that violates company policy. Khatoon says more companies are talking about so-called ‚Äúethical firing‚Äù. This refers to a transparent, rule-based approach to dismissals, where managers can point to concrete breaches in policy rather than subjective issues, such as workers being a ‚Äúpoor fit‚Äù. Targeting terminations in this way has some advantages for employers. Basing decisions on documented infractions can help reduce staff numbers ‚Äì and cut costs ‚Äì without the optics of a struggling business that come with mass layoffs. And unlike big rounds of job cuts, which often require severance packages, firings for conduct issues are typically exempt from such obligations. Lucas Shaw, an expert in hiring and retention strategies, says he has been part of a conversation in which senior staff at a company ‚Äì not one of his clients ‚Äì instructed their IT team to look for misconduct on an individual‚Äôs record to avoid paying a costly redundancy settlement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly underhand.‚Äù Employment experts say such practices underscore the need for staff to closely read and understand company policies and codes of conduct, which are at times being followed more rigidly than in the past. The advice for employers is to provide stronger and simpler guidelines about what is acceptable and what is not. Rules and disciplinary processes must be unambiguous and fairly applied no matter how senior an employee is. ‚ÄúCompanies need to ensure they carry out fair and thorough investigations regarding any allegation of misconduct,‚Äù says GoodCorporation‚Äôs Martin. ‚ÄúNot only does this ensure a proper process is followed, it can also protect an organisation from accusations that what they are doing may have an ulterior motive.‚Äù In an era when workers prioritise transparency, selective enforcement of codes of conduct can erode trust as employees might see it as an excuse to target some staff. This, in the long run, may ‚Äúbe more damaging to the company than the actual employee misconduct‚Äù, warns Martin.

I‚Äôm not going to see either this weekend as both are expected to make tons of cash and draw in a lot of crowds in theaters over the next few days. I‚Äôm content to stay in this weekend and queue up a good movie (or three) on Netflix. Feel the same way? Well, here‚Äôs a handy list of a few underrated movies that are worth your time. You can always watch Glicked later in the year ‚Ä¶ or never, if that‚Äôs more your vibe. We also have guides to the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video, the best movies on Max, and the best movies on Disney+. Sometimes, you just need to see two bona fide movie stars show off their charisma for two hours even if the movie they are in is only so-so. That‚Äôs the case with Spy Game, a 2001 action thriller from Top Gun director Tony Scott. The stars in question are Robert Redford, then entering his senior citizen heartthrob phase, and Brad Pitt, who was still in his prime, golden locks and all. It‚Äôs a pity the movie itself wasn‚Äôt any better. Redford stars as Nathan Muir, a grizzled CIA officer who is pulled into one final case involving his former prot√©g√©, Tom Bishop (Pitt). It seems Bishop has run afoul with China‚Äôs government and is set to be executed in 24 hours. Muir is the only one who can save him, but as he reflects on their complicated past and their shady spy missions in locales such as West Germany, he wonders if this isn‚Äôt the fate Bishop deserves. Spy Game is streaming on Netflix. In Good Company is just good enough, and what‚Äôs wrong with that? The 2004 comedy, which is just about to celebrate its 20th(!) anniversary, is the very definition of vanilla, with squeaky clean stars like Topher Grace, Scarlett Johansson, and Dennis Quaid all bringing varying degrees of beige to their respective roles. Yet the movie works, and Quaid in particular stands out as a star who knows how to turn on the charm to win over an audience. Dan Foreman (Quaid) is a longtime ad executive who is good at his job. That doesn‚Äôt prevent his company from undergoing severe layoffs and demoting him so he now reports to Carter Duryea (Grace), a 26-year-old business prodigy who is separating from his cheating wife. That‚Äôs awkward enough, but when Dan invites Carter over to dinner one night and his young boss begins to fall in love with his even younger daughter Alex (Johansson), things go from awkward to just plain weird fast. The movie plays this scenario largely for laughs, and it is funny to see Quaid work through the sheer absurdity of watching his twentysomething boss awkwardly try to romance his college-bound daughter. Is it also icky? Yeah, a bit, but Quaid and the rest of the cast sells it and the movie doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. In Good Company is streaming on Netflix. Animation is currently in a golden age of creativity. The Spider-Verse films, The Boy and the Heron, and this year‚Äôs The Wild Robot are some of the best ever made in the genre, and that‚Äôs just the non-Disney ones! One of the very best in the last decade is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stunning stop-motion animated film from the good folks over at Laika Studios, who gave the world the modern goth girl classic Coraline. This one is just as good, and features the vocal talents of Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes, Matthew McConaughey, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Art Parkinson as the 12-year-old title protagonist. In feudal Japan, the one-eyed Kubo is sent by his mother to a faraway land to flee his evil aunties and find his missing father‚Äôs armor. There, he teams up with Monkey, a snow monkey charm come to life, Little Hanzo, an origami figure resembling Kubo‚Äôs long-absent dad, and Beetle, a former samurai who cannot remember his past, to travel through strange lands and battle mystical creatures in an attempt to find the armor and avoid capture (or worse) from Kubo‚Äôs wicked extended family. As typical with movies like this, what Kubo finds instead is the value of friendship and the necessity of letting go of loved ones. The film features superb animation and a stirring score by Dario Marianelli, both of which create a colorful fantasy world that would impress even the most jaded cinephile. It‚Äôs a great kids film, yes, but it‚Äôs also a great film period, and all adults should watch Kubo and the Two Strings and ignite their imaginations once again. Kubo and the Two Strings is streaming on Netflix. Are you ready for Glicked? Yes, that's the actual nickname for the simultaneous release of Gladiator 2 and Wicked this weekend. Hollywood is hoping for another bountiful Barbenheimer box office bonanza (say that three times fast), and if the tracking is correct, they are going to get it. Expect tons of crowds at movie theaters this weekend. If you're like me and hate people, er, crowds, then don't worry, I've got you covered. You can stay in and enjoy some films that have been overlooked. I've assembled a list of three underrated movies that are streaming on Max right now. None of them have the spectacle of Ariana Grande singing in a floating pink bubble or Paul Mescal in a blood-stained toga, but maybe that's a good thing. Welcome to the week of Ridley Scott. The 86-year-old filmmaker's next movie is Gladiator II, the 29th feature film in his illustrious five-decade career. The sequel to the Oscar-winning Gladiator, Gladiator II stars Paul Mescal as Lucius, the former heir to the throne and son of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). After Roman forces kill his wife and force him into slavery, Lucius trains to be a gladiator and sets his sights on exacting his vengeance against the Empire. Gladiator II will definitely be an awesome theatrical experience. After seeing Gladiator II, why not revisit more projects in Scott's filmography? FAST services are hosting several of Scott's movies, including Gladiator, for free. Our suggestions include a traumatic war film, a groundbreaking road trip adventure, and an espionage thriller. As we move toward the end of the year, there are more and more reasons to stay indoors and watch a great movie. Amazon Prime Video has one of the best libraries of movies worth exploring, but if you find yourself stuck when deciding what to actually watch, you're not alone. A library as big as Amazon's can actually make deciding what to watch more difficult instead of easier. That's why we've rounded up three titles available on Prime Video that are the perfect way to spend the weekend.

Title: A Look Back On The Best And Worst Industries For Job Seekers In 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/karadennison/2024/11/21/a-look-back-on-the-best-and-worst-industries-for-job-seekers-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T19:27:37Z
Full Content:
A Look Back on The Best and Worst Industries for Job Seekers in 2024 In a year marked by technological breakthroughs and shifting consumer preferences, certain industries have emerged as clear frontrunners in the global economy. From artificial intelligence disrupting traditional business models to healthcare innovations addressing growing demographic demands, 2024 has witnessed remarkable growth across several key sectors, even if it‚Äôs felt like a tough market for job seekers. On the other hand, traditional industries have struggled to keep pace with the evolving business environment, facing challenges from automation, changing consumer behaviors, and digital alternatives. Let‚Äôs take a look back on the best and worst industries for job seekers in 2024 and prepare for the new year. It‚Äôs no surprise that AI has established itself as the undisputed leader in industry growth. With private investment in generative AI projects reaching an astounding $25 billion in 2023, according to Stanford University research, the industry shows no signs of slowing down. The AI market is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027, driven by widespread adoption across sectors, marking AI a hot industry for those looking at an upcoming job search. Healthcare continues to dominate job creation, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting it will account for 45% of all U.S. job gains over the 2022-2032 decade. The sector's growth spans multiple areas, from personal care aides to nurse practitioners and medical service managers. Healthcare is a great industry to look into, even if you don‚Äôt have a traditional healthcare background, as healthcare organizations will need operational and technological support as they continue to scale. E-commerce has further solidified its position as a cornerstone of the retail economy, with the Census Bureau reporting that the industry reached a valuation of $1.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and that number keeps climbing. E-commerce accounts for 16.2% of global retail sales as of Q3 of this year, totaling $288.8 billion for Q3 alone, a 7.5% increase from 2023‚Äôs Q3 numbers, representing a significant shift in consumer shopping habits. This growth in e-commerce has created robust demand for roles in logistics, supply chain management, and digital marketing. The cybersecurity sector has become increasingly critical over the last few years with the fluctuation of remote, hybrid, and return-to-office shifts. The industry has responded to a troubling $8 trillion in cyber attack losses in 2023 with robust growth in security solutions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 32% growth in information security jobs over the coming decade, with information security and cybersecurity professionals commanding average annual salaries exceeding $120,000. The travel industry has shown remarkable recovery after the pandemic, with the World Travel & Tourism Council reporting an increase of 27 million global tourism jobs in 2023. Air travel, hotel occupancy, and international tourism have returned to near pre-pandemic levels, and could hit a new record this Thanksgiving, as about nearly 80 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles away from home during the holiday. The travel industry is vast and incorporates hospitality, transportation, and tourism, and many roles are needed across all sectors within this industry, from sales, marketing, development, logistics, customer service, and more. As organizations invest in infrastructure upgrades, commercial office space focused on employee engagement during return-to-office mandates, and leveraging sustainability practices, the construction industry is in demand. Construction companies that are innovative and provide unique solutions, such as mobile offices, modular and shared spaces, and buildings that can be adaptable for multiple uses, will be in high demand. This industry will be in need of creative tradespeople, innovative leaders, and real estate experts who will be able to partner with organizations looking to grow their physical footprint. With the rise of automation, robotic processing, and 3D printing, advanced manufacturing transforms production by driving productivity, efficiency, and total units produced. Advanced manufacturing is responsible for producing cutting-edge products across almost every industry and is creating a host of new roles from supply chain management, engineering, systems and team management, technology, process improvement, and more. The renewable energy sector has maintained strong momentum, accounting for 10% of global GDP growth, approximately $320 billion, in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. The Inflation Reduction Act's substantial funding for clean energy projects has created numerous opportunities across the sector, from solar panel installation to engineering and supply chain management. It remains to be seen if this will continue to be a growth industry during the upcoming administration. There are several key factors that have fueled explosive growth in these industries: Technological advancement is the most significant driver, transforming how businesses operate and consumers engage with products and services. The rapid evolution of AI, machine learning, and renewable energy technologies has created new possibilities for automation and efficiency while developing entirely new business models and service offerings. Changing consumer preferences have played a pivotal role, particularly in accelerating digital adoption and environmental awareness. The post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior has permanently altered how people shop, work, and access services, benefiting industries that facilitate digital interactions and remote capabilities like telehealth and e-commerce. Recent government policy and regulatory support have provided crucial momentum, particularly in sectors like green energy and healthcare. The financial support for clean energy has created a robust foundation for sustainable industry growth, while healthcare legislation has helped expand access to services and drive innovation in patient care and medical treatments. Demographic shifts have emerged as another significant growth driver, particularly in healthcare and related services. An aging population, combined with increased life expectancy, has created sustained demand for medical services, home care, and innovative health technologies. The technology sector has faced perhaps the most significant headwinds in 2024, with widespread layoffs affecting industry giants and smaller players. Tech companies have been particularly aggressive in workforce reductions, with major players like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM all announcing significant reductions in force. Cisco Systems alone cut 7% of its global workforce as part of a restructuring plan in August of this year, while Amazon has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs across divisions, including AWS, Prime Video, and MGM Studios. The automotive industry has shown significant signs of stress, particularly in the electric vehicle segment. Tesla announced plans to cut more than 10% of its global workforce in April, citing duplication of roles and the need for organizational streamlining. This was followed by Lucid Motors reducing its workforce by 6%, highlighting the challenges facing EV manufacturers in an increasingly competitive market. Media and entertainment companies have experienced substantial contractions throughout 2024. Paramount Global cut 3% of its workforce, roughly about 800 jobs, as the company navigates the decline of traditional cable television. The Los Angeles Times laid off 94 journalists, while Pixar Animation Studios reduced its workforce by 14%, impacting about 175 employees. These cuts reflect the industry's struggle to adapt to changing consumption patterns and the shift toward streaming services. As businesses evolve, job seekers need a strategic approach to capitalize on emerging opportunities. There are many ways to do that, but here are the top ones to have in mind: Start by developing a comprehensive job search plan that aligns with current market demands. High-growth areas like cybersecurity, manufacturing, and healthcare services deserve particular attention as these sectors continue to show demand. Be sure to set goals in your search, like specific salary expectations, desired benefits, and preferred work arrangements, and determine what is a non-negotiable and what you can negotiate on to enable you to focus on what‚Äôs most important to you and your career growth. Beyond understanding basic company information, investigate workplace culture, industry trends, work policies, and technological adoption rates. Learn how you can make an impact within your industry or a new one by pointing out your transferable experience, the impact you‚Äôve made at past companies, and leading with your results and achievements. Additionally, with only 10% of job listings offering remote options despite receiving 46% of applications, carefully evaluate your flexibility requirements regarding work arrangements and factor this into your search strategy. Develop your personal brand with particular emphasis on impact, results, transferable skills, and soft skills. With 79% of leaders believing technical skills have a five-year shelf life, companies increasingly value adaptability, executive communication, and leadership potential. Your personal brand is not just your resume but how you‚Äôre showing up and contributing to your industry. Create a powerful LinkedIn profile with content that showcases these abilities, and ensure your digital presence aligns with your career objectives. Cohesive, clear, and direct branding will help eliminate confusion for hiring managers and recruiters. If you‚Äôre struggling, hire a career coach or resume writer that you trust to tell your career story with you. The investment can have long term benefits for your career beyond landing your next role. While online job boards remain the go-to for job seekers in their search, it‚Äôs increasingly becoming the lowest return on your time and energy investment. Between ghost jobs, automatic rejection emails, and recruiters inundated with resumes copied and pasted from the job description, networking has become increasingly important when it comes to landing your next role. Attend industry conferences, participate in professional communities, and leverage LinkedIn for industry connections. 84% of companies believe that employee referrals are the most cost-effective way to hire, according to a study done by Aptitude Research, and referrals are ranked as the number one top source of hire. Employee referrals also account for a 62% reduction in time-to-fill a role, a 24% improvement in the candidate experience, a 2X improvement in first-year retention, and a 2X more likely improvement in the quality of the hire. This shows that companies see the value in employee referrals across strong and weak economies, and referrals tend to be the highest-valued hire. If you‚Äôre considering entering a job search at the beginning of the year, having the right strategy is important, which includes understanding what industries will be in demand, how to adapt to these career shifts, maintaining a clear focus on your objectives, and leveraging the right strategy to separate yourself from the crowd of job seekers clogging the job boards by leveraging networking and referrals.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said ‚Äî but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin ‚Äî and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago ‚Äî the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush‚Äôs Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release ‚Äúshould be framed and hung in the Louvre‚Äù in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn‚Äôt go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia‚Äôs financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,‚Äù Gensler said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin ‚Äî and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago ‚Äî the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. ‚ÄúThe worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,‚Äù NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. ‚ÄúAdditional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.‚Äù The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October.

Title: Are Return-To-Office Mandates About Efficiency Or Cutting Costs?

Trying to find a balance isn't getting any easier. The Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental governing body headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is taking on remote work for government employees. The move by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce pushes back on remote work‚Äîespecially if government workers quit as a result of the initiative. While 18% of the Fortune 500 companies require 100% full-time in-office work, it‚Äôs no secret that removing remote work as an option is reducing the workforce. A survey by BambooHR found that a quarter of VP and C-suite executives and a fifth of HR pros admitted to hoping for voluntary turnover after implementing a return-to-office policy. Is the push against remote work a strategy for low-cost layoffs, reducing an over-bloated workforce? Or, as the Wall Street Journal reports, is it an initiative designed to drive efficiency, collaboration and growth? Making plans for the future of work. Workers want remote options now more than ever, according to a survey from Buffer. According to the report, 98% of respondents would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, for the rest of their careers. Gallup polling found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be ‚Äúextremely likely‚Äù to look for another job ‚Äúif your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term‚Äù, according to CNN reports. The Daily Mail says that not a single U.S. federal agency had over 50% office space utilization between January and December2023. Consider the cost of carrying that underused real estate on the taxpayers‚Äô balance sheet. Underutilized real estate is part of the reason for the push against remote work. Consider office vacancies in cities like Salesforce, with iconic addresses in downtown San Francisco, New York, Indianapolis and other cities, issued a return to work policy that made headlines. San Francisco and Austin (the two top cities for unused commercial real estate, both tied at 27.7% vacancies, according to CommercialEdge) are cities struggling with utilization. While employees may howl at the mandates, companies have the right (and the shareholder responsibility) to maximize their assets. RTO is the battlefront of utilization, in the push against remote work. Here is a partial list of companies that have fully ended remote work, according to Tech.co: Justification of expenses is a challenge for any organization. Consider that, in a recent survey, 23% of workers at the Department of Commerce (that‚Äôs the government entity that handles business in the US) were found to be overpaid - because they did not tell their employer that they had moved to a less expensive area to work remote. Deception, not remote work, is the real issue here. But consider the possibilities, for workers. If given the choice while making the same salary: would you rather live in Abilene, Texas or the Washington, DC metro area? (That‚Äôs a cost of living difference of 56.42%, if you are curious). Flexibility and work-life balance are important to today‚Äôs workforce. The ability to live where you want, avoiding commutes and urban costs, can be a big advantage for your bottom line - and your family time. Ultimately, the reason any business organization exists is to return shareholder value. For many leaders today, RTO (return to office) mandates are becoming more common - because companies are working in their shareholders‚Äô (or constituents‚Äô) best interests. For employees, those interests may require sacrifice: increasing time in the office...or increasing time in the job search. As Charles Dickens said, ‚ÄúIs it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never have had it?‚Äù That question seems to lie at the center of the push against remote work. Ultimately, work requires sacrifice - that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called work. Time and talents are traded for salary and benefits. Reaching an equitable and fair equation in the workplace is the employment conflict of the ages. Or is that the ‚Äúconflict of the wages‚Äù? Employment at will means that employers can dictate the terms. Employees decide where and how they work. But choices today are limited, tipping the scales in favor of employers. On the battleground of the labor market, only 12,000 new jobs were created in November 2024 (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). And Bamboo reports that 70% of companies plan on increasing the required time in the office. For workers, both economic growth and labor force growth are on a declining trend. When choices are limited, workers must make difficult decisions. Those decisions center on what sacrifices are acceptable, and do-able, in the push against remote work. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Snowflake‚Äôs shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it‚Äôs going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street‚Äôs consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street‚Äôs target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn‚Äôt prevent Snowflake‚Äôs loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That‚Äôs up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it‚Äôs now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,‚Äù Ramaswamy said. However, the company‚Äôs chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street‚Äôs target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. ‚ÄúWe feel good about what we‚Äôre doing, and we think there‚Äôs a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,‚Äù he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake‚Äôs recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake‚Äôs cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. ‚ÄúThrough our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,‚Äù he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company‚Äôs strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. ‚ÄúAs an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,‚Äù the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise‚Äôs hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äôs growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,‚Äù the analyst pointed out. ‚ÄúOn the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.‚Äù The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn‚Äôt reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo‚Äôs tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake‚Äôs data warehouse. ‚ÄúBy bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures ‚Äî unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,‚Äù Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake‚Äôs hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic‚Äôs most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake‚Äôs AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake‚Äôs executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake‚Äôs AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake‚Äôs Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. ‚ÄúOur partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,‚Äù Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake‚Äôs stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.
