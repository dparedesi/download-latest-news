Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Amazon said Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, its biggest round of layoffs in years, as it invests more in artificial intelligence. In Amazon’s announcement, top human resources executive Beth Galetti cited AI, which she said is the "most transformative technology we've seen since the internet." She added that AI was "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," Galetti continued. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent employees at the company an email with the subject line “Some thoughts on Generative AI.” In it, Jassy signaled that Amazon's workforce would likely shrink in the future. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing and more people doing other types of jobs," he wrote. Jassy continued, “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The job cuts at Amazon come amid a wave of layoffs at other tech and retail firms. Target said last week it would cut 1,000 corporate office jobs and close 800 open roles. Meta Platforms, owner of Instagram and Facebook, also cut 600 jobs Wednesday and Microsoft began eliminating 9,000 jobs in July. Paramount Skydance, which competes with Amazon in streaming and for sports rights, also plans to begin cutting 1,000 workers this week. The total number of cuts could reach up to 2,000, Bloomberg reported. Salesforce reduced its workforce by 4,000 employees in September, citing "the benefits and efficiencies" of AI. But AI is not just impacting hiring in the media and technology sectors. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told employees in recent weeks that the Wall Street lender would "constrain headcount growth through the end of the year" and cut a limited amount of jobs due to efficiencies gained through the use of AI tools. Amazon had 1.55 million employees worldwide at the end of the second quarter, which ended June 30, according to a filing. About 350,000 of those work in corporate offices, Reuters reported. The tech giant said it would give employees whose roles are eliminated Tuesday “90 days to look for a new role internally,” with recruiters prioritizing internal candidates “to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” Amazon has in recent years also ordered corporate employees back into the office and asked them to move closer to the physical office locations where they are based. Workers were told in June to relocate to Amazon hubs such as Seattle and the Virginia area, Bloomberg News reported. Those locations are where two of Amazon's regional headquarters are located. Amazon is set to announce its third quarter earnings Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company, which currently has a market value of more than $2.4 trillion, to report revenue of more than $170 billion. Tuesday's cuts may only be the beginning. Galetti said Amazon expects "to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains."

Title: Amazon layoffs: Who will get laid-off, from when and why as online retail giant cuts 14,000 jobs — All you need to know

E-commerce and tech giant Amazon plans to lay off around 14,000 jobs from today, 28 October, to reduce expenses and manage “overhiring” during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Reuters report citing sources. They added that on 27 October, managers of the affected teams were asked to undergo training on how to communicate with the staff following email notifications that will start going out on the morning of 28 October (US time). The report said that a spokesperson for Amazon has declined to comment when asked about the layoffs. “The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs,” Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon told employees in a message today, AP reported. Earlier reports by Reuters and Fortune said that Amazon is preparing to eliminate as many as 30,000 corporate jobs. Amazon employs around 15 lakh people overall, of which 3.5 lakh are corporate employees. These jobs will be cut. Further, the Reuters report cited sources as saying that these job cuts will include personnel across Amazon Web Services (AWS), the operations, devices, and services division, and the human resources, People Experience and Technology, or PXT division. Notably, if the layoff numbers do reach 30,000, this would be the company's largest layoff since late 2022, when it cut 27,000 roles. Over the past two years, the CEO Andy Jassy-led company has laid off fewer employees across divisions, including communications, devices and podcasting. The sources said that the number of those impacted could change as the company's financial priorities shift. An earlier Fortune report cited sources saying that as much as 15 per cent of the human resources division could get pink slips. The development is being viewed as Amazon’s cost-cutting strategy as it seeks to calibrate “over hiring” after the COVID-19 pandemic to keep up with online demand and expansion projects. The report said that Jassy is looking to trim “excess bureaucracy” by reducing the number of managers and installed an anonymous complaint line to identify “inefficiencies”. The line has received around 1,500 responses and 450 process changes, it added. In June, Jassy also told employees that the company would increase the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The memo stressed the importance of employees “embracing” this change, stating, "… become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the companyWe expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Two of Reuters' sources also said that the cuts come as Amazon's back-to-office program has failed to generate enough attrition. They said that the cuts include some employees who are not swiping in daily (five days working) and are being told to voluntarily resign and leave without severance.

Title: Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs, and it’s not done | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-10-28T10:18:12Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon said it would cut 14,000 corporate staffers this year in a mass layoff aimed at readying the company for wide adoption of AI technology. The company noted that it would be hiring in key areas and would prioritize those who lost their jobs for those roles. But the company also said it wasn’t done with layoffs. “We expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience in a memo to employees that the company put on its public blog. Reuters, which on Monday first reported Amazon would lay off staff, said the job cuts could ultimately reach 30,000. Galetti said Amazon needs to operate more leanly to achieve CEO Andy Jassy’s vision of operating like the world’s biggest startup. Jassy wants the company to remain nimble so it can adapt and change quickly as AI upends the technology sector. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti said. “We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024 survey filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so the cuts represent about 4% of the company’s overall staff. Layoffs will begin Tuesday. Most employees will be given 90 days to look for new roles internally, while people that can’t get new jobs at Amazon will be given severance pay and additional benefits. In June, Jassy said in a separate blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he bluntly admitted in a previous note. Al won’t just effect change at Amazon, Jassy said. AI “will change how we all work and live,” including “billions” of AI agents “across every company and in every imaginable field.” However, much of this remains speculative. “Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast,” Jassy said. It’s not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the company cut 27,000 workers in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook. The company’s cuts are the latest in a long line of efforts to make Amazon more efficient and focused, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note to investors Monday. “Markets across the world are tightening at the same time as underlying costs are rising,” Saunders said. “Amazon is not immune to this, and it needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom line performance. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months, especially for young tech workers. There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as companies cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts say a lot of these fears aren’t backed by substantial research. This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence. Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can’t find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the next few years. Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Amazon has announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said that the potential for growth in the company’s AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been a pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during the government shut down, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year’s holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom-line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup."Galetti said that despite the company performing well, it is cutting jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: She added that Amazon needs to be leaner and have fewer layers of management in order to move faster, noting that it is reorganizing resources to invest in its biggest bets while continuing to hire in other areas. Amazon has a total of 1.55 million employees globally. The cuts would represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees. The latest move is part of Jassy's effort to create a leaner and more disciplined company. In recent years, Amazon cut management layers, slashed bureaucracy, tightened costs, overhauled performance and pay systems, and ordered most corporate employees back to the office five days a week. The changes really started after the pandemic, when Amazon's growth slowed. The company moved to rein in costs by axing unprofitable projects and cutting a bloated workforce. Jassy said in June that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink Amazon's workforce. Earlier this year, the company froze the hiring budget in its massive retail division, and in July, its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, also faced layoffs. Big Tech firms have cut thousands of jobs this year, even as their businesses continue to perform well, as they double down on investments in AI. Microsoft announced plans to eliminate around 15,000 positions this year, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees in a June memo that the company must remain focused on its three core priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven layoffs, informing staff in its risk organization last week that their roles are being replaced by automation technology.

Title: Amazon prepares for major layoffs among office workers - reports

Amazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by "approximately 14,000 roles". Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers. Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff, external that the move would make the company "even stronger" by shifting resources "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well. At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (Â£125bn). But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and was "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she added. The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was "working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon. Those who cannot will receive "transition support" including severance pay, it said. The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK. The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide. This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures, external that Amazon submitted to the US government last year. Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services. Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency. Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said then. Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years. It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic. After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when - its enormous AI investments would pay off. Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors. Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts. "We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly," he told the BBC. "They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable." Additional reporting by Philippa Wain Are you an Amazon employee? Share your experiences.

Title: Amazon India to lay off up to 1,100 employees as part of global restructuring

However, the exact number is not known,” said a person aware of the matter. This marks Amazon’s largest workforce reduction since 2022, when it eliminated about 27,000 positions. The latest move is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s ongoing cost-optimisation drive to streamline operations and flatten management structures following the pandemic-era hiring spree. Globally, the layoffs will impact multiple divisions including human resources (People Experience and Technology, or PXT), operations, devices, services, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Managers in affected teams were briefed earlier this week to notify employees. In a note to employees, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience and Technology, said the company is “reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to invest in our biggest bets and what matters most to customers.” Employees impacted will receive transition support, severance pay, health insurance benefits, and up to 90 days to find internal roles, she added. Despite the layoffs, India remains a strategic market for Amazon. The company had announced a ₹2,000-crore investment earlier this year to expand its logistics and fulfilment network to make deliveries faster and more reliable. Amazon is also scaling up its quick commerce vertical, Amazon Now, in a segment that demands high cash burn to capture market share. In FY25, Amazon India’s business units narrowed losses by tightening expenses. Revenue from operations at Amazon Seller Services rose 19% to ₹30,139 crore, while Amazon Transport Services posted 8% growth at ₹5,284 crore. The layoffs come amid a broader global tech slowdown. Over 200 technology firms have let go of nearly 98,000 employees this year as companies pivot to AI-led efficiency and automation.

Title: Amazon plans to axe 30,000 corporate jobs in massive AI-driven layoff wave

Amazon is preparing to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions. This is the largest single layoff under CEO Andy Jassy's leadership. The company cites cost-cutting and the integration of AI as primary drivers. This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The cuts impact nearly 10% of its corporate workforce across key divisions.

This follows a previous round of 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. In a move that sends a chilling message about the future of the white-collar worker, Amazon is preparing to swing the axe on a staggering 30,000 corporate employees. The job cuts, set to begin Tuesday, represent a nearly 10 percent reduction of the companyâs 350,000-person corporate workforce and mark the largest single layoff since the tech giant eliminated 27,000 positions beginning in late 2022. This decision, driven by a push for cost-cutting and the integration of artificial intelligence, highlights a disturbing trend where corporate efficiency is prioritized over the livelihoods of thousands. According to reports from Reuters, the layoffs will ripple across multiple divisions. The corporate bloodletting is expected to affect human resources, known internally as the People Experience and Technology or PXT group, as well as operations, devices and services, and the vital Amazon Web Services cloud unit. This strategic shift underscores a fundamental restructuring of how the corporate behemoth operates, moving away from human labor and toward automated systems. The scale of this layoff is unprecedented for Amazon under CEO Andy Jassyâs leadership. Since taking the helm from founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy has overseen a relentless campaign to trim what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy. This latest cut of 30,000 jobs, however, dwarfs previous efforts and signals a new, aggressive phase in the companyâs operational philosophy, one that appears to view a significant portion of its corporate staff as expendable. A pattern of corporate contraction This is not an isolated event but part of a concerning pattern. The planned 30,000 job cuts follow the 27,000 positions eliminated in 2022 and 2023. This repeated contraction suggests a company in a perpetual state of flux, one that rapidly expanded during the pandemic only to just as rapidly discard the very employees who helped manage that growth. The human cost of this corporate strategy is immense, creating widespread uncertainty and instability. At the heart of this workforce reduction is a relentless drive to reduce costs and reverse what the company calls "pandemic-era overhiring." Yet, this justification rings hollow to those who remember the massive profits Amazon reaped during the same period. The company now seeks a "stronger cost structure," a corporate euphemism that often translates to shattered careers and broken families for those on the receiving end of a pink slip. The role of artificial intelligence in these layoffs cannot be overstated. Jassy himself has been a vocal proponent of AI, acknowledging that its increased use would lead to job cuts by automating repetitive and routine tasks. In a June communication, he warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind. He wrote that those who âbecome conversant in AIâ would be best positioned to âhelp us reinvent the company.â This creates a troubling ultimatum for workers: adapt to the technology that may replace your colleagues or become obsolete yourself. Efficiency comes with a human cost Managers of impacted teams were instructed to undergo special training on Monday to learn how to communicate the bad news to their staff. Email notifications are scheduled to start going out on Tuesday morning, a cold and impersonal method for delivering life-altering news. The process reduces human beings to mere data points in a cost-saving algorithm, stripping away the dignity of work and loyalty. Further adding to the callous nature of these cuts are reports regarding Amazonâs stringent return-to-office policy. The policy, among the strictest in the tech industry, was reportedly intended to generate employee attrition. When that failed to produce enough voluntary departures, the company allegedly told some remote employees they had "voluntarily quit" and could leave without severance, a blatant maneuver to save money at the direct expense of workers. While Amazon pares back its corporate roles, it simultaneously announced plans to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush. This dichotomy reveals a corporate priority for flexible, temporary labor over stable, long-term careers. It paints a picture of a future workforce where permanent positions are scarce and job security is a relic of the past. As artificial intelligence and automation become central to corporate strategy, the very definition of work and the value of the worker are being radically redefined, and not necessarily for the better. The pursuit of profit and efficiency, it seems, has a very human price.

Title: Amazon Plans to Cut 30K Jobs Amid AI Push
URL: https://www.newser.com/story/377605/amazon-plans-to-cut-30k-jobs-amid-ai-push.html
Time Published: 2025-10-28T06:00:00Z

Amazon is preparing to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees starting Tuesday, according to sources cited by Reuters. The move is part of a broader effort to cut costs and address overhiring that occurred during the pandemic's surge in demand. While the cuts represent a small fraction of Amazon's total workforce of 1.55 million, they account for nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate staffers—and amount to the largest round of layoffs since 2022, when about 27,000 jobs were cut. Per a source who spoke to CNBC, this round of cuts will be the biggest ever for the company's corporate employees. The layoffs are expected to span multiple divisions, including human resources, devices, services, and operations. Managers in affected areas were reportedly given training on Monday to prepare for informing staff, with official notifications set to begin Tuesday morning. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing to streamline company operations, reduce management layers, and cut back on what he describes as excessive bureaucracy. Amazon has introduced an anonymous complaint system to identify inefficiencies, resulting in hundreds of process changes. Jassy has previously indicated that increased use of artificial intelligence is likely to drive further job reductions, as automation replaces repetitive tasks. The exact number of layoffs could change as Amazon's financial priorities evolve, but reports suggest that the human resources division alone may see cuts of around 15%. Despite the reductions, Amazon is still planning to hire 250,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period, matching previous years.

Title: Amazon prepares for major layoffs among office workers, media reports say

Amazon has confirmed it plans to cut thousands of jobs, saying it needs to be "organised more leanly" to seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant said on Tuesday it would reduce its global corporate workforce by "approximately 14,000 roles". Earlier reporting had suggested it was planning to lay off as many as 30,000 workers. Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon, wrote in a note to staff that the move would make the company "even stronger" by shifting resources "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". She acknowledged that some would question the move given the company was performing well. At the end of July, Amazon reported second quarter results which beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn). But Ms Galetti said the cuts were needed because AI was "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and was "enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before." "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she added. The note, shared with Amazon employees earlier on Tuesday, said the company was "working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted" - including by helping those affected find new roles within Amazon. Those who cannot will receive "transition support" including severance pay, it said. The BBC has asked if it will affect employees in the UK. The company has more than 1.5 million employees across its warehouses and offices worldwide. This includes around 350,000 corporate workers, which include those in executive, managerial and sales roles, according to figures that Amazon submitted to the US government last year. Like many technology firms, Amazon hired aggressively during the Covid-19 pandemic to meet the surge in demand for online deliveries and digital services. Amazon boss Andy Jassy has since focused on reducing spending as the company invests heavily in AI tools to boost efficiency. Mr Jassy said in June that the increase in AI tools will likely lead to job cuts as machines take over routine tasks. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said then. Amazon has carried out several rounds of cuts to its corporate division in recent years. It laid off around 27,000 workers over several months in 2022, as rivals similarly looked to reverse hiring increases made during the pandemic. After the company posted its latest financial results in July, its more subdued profit guidance for the forthcoming quarter left some sceptical of whether - or when - its enormous AI investments would pay off. Slower growth for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google, also sparked concern among some investors. Amazon will report its latest results on Thursday for the period ending 30 September. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said the wider industry would be watching Amazon closely as it embarked on its latest round of cuts. "We are already seeing jobs in software development be shed thanks to the capabilities of some of these AI tools, and the big companies will be looking to redistribute and restructure their workforces accordingly," he told the BBC. "They have the data and can apply AI in a way that unfortunately means job losses are inevitable."

Amazon's latest cuts fed into anxiety about AI replacing workers. But some are sceptical that recent layoffs are a telling sign of how AI is affecting employment.

The Dow and Nasdaq also reached all-time highs. Fed rate cut, US-China trade talks, and key tech earnings, despite an ongoing US government shutdown add uncertainty.

Title: Amazon To Slash Up To 30,000 Corporate Jobs, Largest Cut Since 2022: Reuters
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/amazon-to-slash-up-to-30000-corporate-jobs-largest-cut-since-2022-reuters
Time Published: 2025-10-28T01:20:00Z

Amazon is reportedly planning a massive reduction in its non-warehouse staff, targeting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting this week, as the e-commerce giant works to pare expenses and correct for pandemic-era overhiring, according to three sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters. This significant workforce contraction, which would be the largest layoff at Amazon since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated starting in late 2022, represents nearly 10% of the company's approximately 350,000 corporate employees. The job cuts are expected to begin with email notifications being sent out on Tuesday morning, following preparatory training given to impacted team managers on Monday, Reuters reported. The core drivers for the reduction are two-fold, an aggressive effort to cut costs company-wide amid a tougher economic environment and to compensate for the major staffing boost that occurred during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic when demand for online commerce surged. The scale of this reduction highlights a continued trend of efficiency drives across the tech sector. Sources indicated to Reuters that the cuts may impact a wide array of divisions, including human resources, known internally as People Experience and Technology, as well as the devices and services and operations groups. This latest downsizing aligns directly with chief executive officer Andy Jassy’s strategic initiative to reduce what he has characterised as an "excess of bureaucracy" within the massive organization, including a focus on managerial layers. Jassy has also publicly suggested that the company's increased reliance on Artificial Intelligence tools would likely result in further job eliminations by automating many repetitive and routine tasks, a shift that analysts suggest is a major underlying factor in such substantial corporate staff reductions. This move, one of the largest single rounds of tech industry layoffs in recent years, underscores the company's commitment to prioritising efficiency over sheer headcount. Despite the deep corporate cuts, Amazon appears to be expecting a strong holiday season. The company still plans to offer 250,000 seasonal jobs to staff its warehouses, matching its seasonal hiring figure from the past two years. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the matter, Reuters noted. The report surfaces just before the company is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Amazon is reportedly preparing to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate positions starting Tuesday, 28 October, marking its largest workforce reduction since 2022, according to a Reuters report citing individuals familiar with the matter. This would mark Amazon's largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions. The move is part of Amazon’s broader cost-cutting strategy as it seeks to streamline operations and recalibrate after the Covid-19 pandemic-era over-hiring, when surging online demand prompted aggressive expansion across divisions. While the planned redundancies account for only a fraction of Amazon’s 1.55 million global workforce, they represent nearly 10% of its 3,50,000 corporate employees. The cuts underscore a shift in focus from rapid growth to sustained profitability, as the e-commerce giant navigates a more cautious economic climate and slower consumer spending trends. Amazon last executed major layoffs in late 2022, eliminating approximately 27,000 roles across its business units. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions. Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but other areas of its core consumer business are also likely to be affected. Amazon has declined to comment publicly on the planned layoffs despite multiple media requests. According to Reuters, the company directed managers of affected teams to undergo communication training on Monday in preparation for staff notifications, which are expected to begin via email on Tuesday morning. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in the company's history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed. Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staff on their payrolls. Andy Jassy himself is one of those employers. The CEO fired a warning to his employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also said there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Since succeeding Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, Jassy has built a reputation as a cost-cutter and operational reformer. Amazon managers are routinely required to meet targets for ‘unregretted attrition’ (URA), a measure indicating the percentage of staff the company can afford to lose through voluntary departures, managed exits, or layoffs. However, people familiar with developments told Fortune that the latest wave of cuts is being treated differently within the company, signalling a broader restructuring effort rather than a routine trimming of underperforming staff.

Title: Report: Amazon to let go of up to 30,000 employees, starting this week
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/27/report-amazon-let-go-30000-employees-starting-week/

UPDATED 20:08 EDT / OCTOBER 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Amazon.com Inc. is reportedly planning to let go up to 30,000 employees in what would be its largest ever round of layoffs. Some workers could be let go as early as Tuesday, as the company makes its latest in a series of moves aimed at cutting down costs and conserving cash. A report by Reuters cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter as saying that the job cuts would represent about 10% of Amazon’s global corporate workforce, though not all of them will happen this week. However, it’s expected that thousands of notices will go out to employees this week. The layoffs are set to affect virtually every part of Amazon’s enormous organization, including its human resources department, cloud computing and advertising teams, and a number of other business units. The company hasn’t yet finalized the total number of reductions, according to one anonymous source. The layoffs come at a time when many American companies are looking for ways to reduce their operating costs or at least slow their head count growth, due to rising prices, a tight labor market and the on-again, off-again prospect of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. In the case of Amazon, Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) has been striving to cut costs for years, partly to compensate for the company’s massive investments in artificial intelligence, which requires the construction of enormous data centers. The online retail giant has laid off about 27,000 employees since 2022. According to Reuters, Amazon views the cuts as part of an ongoing effort to correct its aggressive hiring during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, there was a significant boom in online shopping that resulted in Amazon doubling its warehouse network in less than two years, creating thousands of new blue- and white-collor positions. Jassy has also been looking for ways to do more with less, notably by using artificial intelligence systems to automate work that was previously performed by humans. In June, he became one of the first high profile CEOs in the U.S. to admit that AI will likely eliminate the need for many jobs, and predicted that Amazon will replace humans in thousands of roles in the coming years. He called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change” and noted that it’s already affecting the way it runs its business. “​​As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he said at the time. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Earlier this month, Amazon lifted the lid on a new, AI-powered robotic warehouse system called Blue Jay that’s able to automate tasks such as scanning and sorting packages. It’s believed that the system will allow the company to build smaller warehouses closer to consumers in urban areas, where it hasn’t been able to operate so far. In addition, the company is also experimenting with AI tools that can predict shopper’s needs and make recommendations for their next purchases. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Amazon is still trying to adjust its business following its all-out hiring spree during the height of the pandemic. He believes the company is trying to balance the layoffs with the roll out of new automated systems and processes powered by robotics and AI, so as to avoid too much disruption to its business. But doing so is challenging because there’s no real precedent for such maneuvering. “These layoffs are different because it seems they’re going to be applied across all functions within Amazon, but on the flip side it suggests Andy Jassy believes that all parts of its business can be automated with new technologies,” Mueller said. “However, he needs to be careful to time the layoffs and the roll out of its process improvements, because he cannot allow dips in business performance. Amazon’s razor thin retail margins make the timing of the shift to machine decisions very tricky.” Another problem Amazon has to contend with its the growing perception that it’s struggling in AI, with recent comments from analysts voicing concerns that it appears to be lagging behind competitors such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp. In July, Amazon reported a sharp increase in profit and sales for its second quarter, but its cloud computing business failed to match the growth of its rivals’ and its stock declined. At the time, AllianceBernstein LP analysts said in a note that the results posed “uncomfortable questions” for the company about whether it’s an “AI winner or a laggard.” Despite this, Amazon has continued to throw billions of dollars at its AI investments. It reported $31.4 billion in capital expenditure during the second quarter, and explained that most of this was related to building out cloud computing infrastructure for AI. The company said at the time that the number was “representative” of its planned spending for the remainder of the year. Amazon is expected to report its third-quarter financial results after the bell on Thursday, Oct. 30, when we’ll likely learn more about the planned layoffs.

Δ The cuts will target the company’s human resources; operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services divisions, Reuters reported Monday (Oct. 27), citing unnamed sources. The impacted staffers will start receiving email notifications Tuesday morning, according to the report. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. These job cuts would follow a series of cuts that began in late 2022 and eventually totaled about 27,000 layoffs, according to the Reuters report. The new cuts would amount to nearly 10% of Amazon’s corporate employees, who number about 350,000, but only a small percentage of the company’s total workforce of 1.55 million, the report said. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The company is set to announce its third quarter earnings on Thursday (Oct. 30). Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September 2024 that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time in a message shared with Amazon employees and shared online. When Amazon began its earlier series of layoffs in November 2022, Jassy said the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years and was looking at workforce levels. In other news, Amazon said Monday that it plans to invest more than €1.4 billion in the Netherlands over the next three years to support both Amazon Web Services and the company’s retail business. The company has served customers in the Netherlands for five years and now has more than 4,500 of the country’s small and medium-sized businesses selling on its platform, according to a Monday press release.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon plans to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees, beginning tomorrow, reports say. The cuts would total nearly 10% of the company’s corporate jobs, as advances in artificial intelligence stoke fears about the white-collar workforce and the US labor market shows signs of weakening. Reuters was the first to report the job cuts. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024 survey filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce. It’s not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the company cut 27,000 workers in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook. The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months, especially for young tech workers. There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as companies cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts say a lot of these fears aren’t backed by substantial research. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Amazon Poised to Lay Off Up To 30,000 Employees Tomorrow

Multiple reports now say that Amazon will lay off up to 30,000 employees as soon as tomorrow, though some layoffs could extend into early 2026. The coming Amazon layoffs were first reported by Reuters, but The New York Times has since independently confirmed the story. Both reports cite multiple sources. And both claim that Amazon is trying to cut billions in expenses and pare down a workforce that ballooned during the 2020 pandemic. Amazon is unique among its Big Tech peers in that it employs far more people because of its massive logistics and warehouse operations, both of which are largely unrelated to technology. It employed over 1.5 million people as of the end of 2024, but only 350,000 or so are considered corporate employees. So the 30,000 figure, if accurate, would be nearly 10 percent of that latter workforce. And the largest single layoff in Amazon’s history. It previously eliminated about 27,000 positions in late 2022 and early 2023. According to Reuters, managers were required to undergo training today to handle tomorrow’s layoffs, and notifications will begin going out via email starting Tuesday morning. The layoffs won’t include Amazon’s annual seasonal hiring binge, with Reuters claiming that the firm will offer 250,000 temporary jobs to help staff warehouses during the coming holiday season. Amazon will report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. The company is expected to spend about $120 billion in the current fiscal year on capital expenses tied to its AI datacenter buildout, a gain of 50 percent over the previous year.

Title: Amazon to Chop 30,000 Corporate Jobs This Week, Its Largest Layoffs Ever

Human resources, devices and services and operations are expected to be the most-impacted branches Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 jobs this week its latest effort to lower expenses. The move, according to Reuters, will impact the company’s corporate arm, with human resources, devices and services and operations receiving the most cuts. Expected to begin rolling out Tuesday, the proposed 30,000 eliminated roles will mark Amazon’s largest-ever round of cuts, surpassing the 27,000 jobs exited in 2022. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reportedly has plans to eliminate an overabundance of managers and beurocracy build-up at the company. He also said back in June that more use of AI going forward would likely lead to other cuts at the company. Amazon did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Layoffs continue to wrack the tech and entertainment industry. Paramount will slash roughly 1,000 jobs on Wednesday in its first round of major cuts under new CEO David Ellison, with additional cuts expected at a later date, according to Bloomberg. The total cuts are expected to impact around 2,000 employees. The latest round of layoffs at the media giant come as new owner Skydance looks to exceed $2 billion in cost savings. In August, Paramount president Jeff Shell warned that the layoffs would be “painful,” but emphasized that the media giant doesn’t want to “cut its way to growth.” And elsewhere in the media world, NBC News eliminated its teams dedicated to covering issues affecting Black, Asian American, Latino and LGBTQ+ groups as part of its layoffs of about 150 staffers. The cuts mean that the verticals NBC BLK, NBC Asian America, NBC Latino and NBC OUT no longer have dedicated teams bolstering their coverage. Tech companies Microsoft, Meta and Intel also saw major layoffs this year, with the latter totaling 22,000 jobs cut so far.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is planning thousands of job cuts across its corporate workforce, and managers have been warned to prepare for an announcement this week, according to people familiar with the matter, an internal document, and internal messages seen by Business Insider. The move is expected to be announced on Tuesday, and will impact employees in the US, the UK, and Canada, according to recent internal messages sent to Amazon managers. A draft email that's due to go out to impacted employees noted that Amazon is eliminating jobs "after a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward." The draft document also described a severance package that includes full pay and benefits for the next 90 days. Business Insider viewed a copy of this draft email, along with copies of the internal messages to Amazon managers. Various teams within Amazon, including human resources and retail, will be affected, the people familiar said. Thousand of employees will likely be eliminated, these people added, while asking not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported the cuts this week could impact as many as 30,000 employees. That would represent roughly 10% of Amazon's corporate workforce. CEO Andy Jassy has been overhauling the tech giant this year, reseting a hardcore culture that existed when Amazon was a smaller, scrappier company. He's slashed layers of management, attacked bureaucracy, enforced strict cost discipline, updated performance metrics and pay structures, and sent most corporate employees back to the office five days a week. That followed a post-pandemic period when Amazon responded to a dramatic growth slowdown. The company scaled back unprofitable projects and trimmed a bloated workforce. Amazon doubled its workforce to 1.6 million from 2019 to 2021, but that number dipped to 1.55 million last year. Amazon has already cut at least 27,000 employees since late 2022. In June, Jassy told employees that efficiency gains from AI would reduce the company's workforce. Amazon also froze the hiring budget for its big retail business earlier this year. And the cloud business, Amazon Web Services, saw layoffs in July. Reuters said the job cuts would affect Amazon's HR and devices teams. Fortune previously reported that Amazon could cut up to 15% of its HR staff. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer Amazon is set to lay off tens of thousands of its corporate employees this week, marking the company’s biggest staffing reduction since roughly 27,000 staffers were eliminated at the end of 2022. As first reported by Reuters, the Andy Jassy-led ecommerce giant will cut as many as 30,000 workers — nearly 10% of its corporate workforce — beginning as early as Tuesday. The layoffs come just before Amazon reports its latest quarterly earnings results on Thursday and are, according to Reuters’ sources, part of efforts to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” Related Stories Mia McKenna-Bruce to Play Ringo's First Wife Maureen Starkey in Sam Mendes' Beatles Movies As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. According to Reuters, the corporate staff count is approximately 350,000. Popular on Variety Representatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment Monday. Back in June, Amazon CEO Jassy sent a memo to staff that outlined how generative AI would soon “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” but also cut the overall number of jobs at the company. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Amazon is preparing to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. The move is part of an effort to rein in costs after what the company now views as overexpansion during the pandemic boom. The planned layoffs represent nearly 10 percent of Amazon’s roughly 350,000 corporate employees, though only a fraction of its 1.55 million global workforce. If finalized, it would mark the company’s largest round of job reductions since approximately 27,000 roles were eliminated beginning in late 2022. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment, according to Reuters. The cuts are expected to hit various divisions across the company. Roles at People Experience and Technology (human resources), devices and services, and operations are among those in the firing line, depending on shifting financial priorities, the report said. Amazon has already trimmed smaller numbers of positions across devices, communications, podcasting and other teams over the past two years. Managers in impacted business units participated in training on Monday to prepare for notification emails scheduled to go out Tuesday morning, according to the report. CEO Andy Jassy has launched a push to eliminate what he has called “excess bureaucracy,” including reducing layers of management. He has set up an anonymous internal system to flag inefficiencies, which has generated about 1,500 submissions and more than 450 process changes so far. Jassy said earlier this year that increased use of AI tools would likely result in further workforce reductions by automating repetitive tasks. The final scale of layoffs may evolve as Amazon’s financial strategy continues to adjust, the sources told Reuters. Amazon shares rose 1.3% to $227.11 near Monday’s close. The ecommerce and cloud giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Amazon Plans Massive Layoffs After Nine Months of President Trump
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/202322/amazon-layoffs
Time Published: 2025-10-27T21:08:09Z
Full Content:
Online retail giant Amazon plans to slash as many as 30,000 corporate jobs Tuesday, which would be the biggest number of layoffs at the company in three years. Reuters reports that the cuts would amount to 10 percent of the company’s close to 350,000 corporate employees, and would be across different departments. The last time Amazon cut this many jobs was 2022, when 27,000 were slashed late in the year. The move follows Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying in June that AI tools would lead to job cuts. It’s not a good indicator for the economy under President Trump. The website Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts, estimates that 98,344 technology employees have been laid off this year from 216 companies. The site also estimates that 71,981 government employees have been laid off by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, out of a total of 182,528 federal employees departing from the jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report last month showed unemployment at a four-year high, with only 22,000 jobs added in August (compared to a forecast of 75,000). Thanks to the government shutdown, job and unemployment figures from September aren’t known, but they are likely pretty bad. ADP, which processes payrolls, reported earlier this month that the private sector lost 32,000 jobs in September. While the shutdown hides an official tally of how bad employment numbers are in America right now, Amazon’s impending layoffs, and estimates from other sources, indicate that the economy isn’t very strong right now—and the buck stops with the president. California will send election observers to counter the “election monitors” that Trump plans on sending to multiple deep blue districts in the state ahead of next week’s special election. “They’re not going to be allowed to interfere in ways that the law prohibits,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday. “We cannot be naïve. The Republican Party asked for the U.S. DOJ to come in.” “[Trump] is laying the groundwork. He is socializing an idea that is very dangerous,” Bonta added, noting that Trump still claims to have won the 2020 presidential election. “All indications, all arrows show that this is a tee up for something more dangerous in the 2026 midterms—and maybe beyond.” Trump’s Justice Department last week announced it would send federal election monitors to several blue districts in California and New Jersey. In California, the Trump administration is likely well aware of Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would redraw the state’s congressional districts to help Democrats gain more seats in the U.S. House. Trump’s DOJ monitoring a crucial election in California is a recipe for basic voting rights to be blatantly violated. Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday called it a “deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.” “They have no business doing that. They have no basis to do that,” he said in a video posted on X. “We have a statewide election for a statewide constitution. This is about voter intimidation, this is about voter suppression. Period, full stop.” Donald Trump's puppet DOJ has no business screwing around with next month's election.Sending the feds into California polling places is a deliberate attempt to scare off voters and undermine a fair election.We will not back down. Californians decide our future — no one else. pic.twitter.com/olGXV5GBjL The Irish have had enough of Donald Trump. McCormack’s Irish Pub in Richmond, Virginia, made waves earlier this month when its owner, William “Mac” McCormack, released some hot merchandise: a load of “Fuck Trump” black T-shirts, retailing for $11 a pop. The shirts proudly display the pub’s logo: an antifascist emblem superimposed over a shamrock. A printed phrase circles around the icon, reading: “Fuck ICE, Fuck Nazis, Fuck Trump,” according to McCormack’s Facebook. But the top did not resonate with those on the ideological right, who consumed the comment section before spilling over to the pub’s review pages on Yelp and Google. Some commenters scorned the pub’s self-advertised ideology as “disgusting,” deriding the shirts as a stunt that would “alienate half of [McCormack’s] clientele.” One Yelp user, who goes by Marge and lives nearly 3,000 miles away in San Francisco, wrote that the service was “terrible” and the “food is almost as bad.” “Save your time and money. This place sucks. Not a true Irish Pub,” the account wrote, leaving a one-star review on Saturday. “Liberals who think we care where they stand politically.” But any regular would know that the shirt—and its message—are nothing unusual for McCormack’s. “I was just making T-shirts that align with most of my customers, with the pub’s beliefs,” McCormack told RVA Magazine. The shirt is really nothing new. There’s always been some variation of the shirt, according to its owner. “It used to just say, ‘Fuck Nazis.’ We just clarified who the Nazis were,” McCormack said. McCormack’s is one of Richmond’s oldest dive bars. The successful institution has since expanded into two whiskey restaurants—McCormack’s Big Whisky Grill and McCormack’s Whisky Grill—but the original establishment has been proud to be punk since the 1990s, according to RVA. “I’ve never hidden my politics there,” McCormack told the publication. “It’s bigger than just the bar, it’s what you believe. And it’s what I believe one hundred percent.” Despite the backlash, there’s nothing illegal about voicing dissent against the government. Protesting the government is a protected right under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as established by the Founding Fathers. Comparing MAGA politics to Nazi Germany, McCormack told RVA that small-business owners should stick by their principles. “I don’t think we should be silent,” he said. Voicing his disdain for the current administration has actually turned out to be a positive business decision for McCormack, who told RVA that the shirts have since sold out and that “all three locations have been busier than normal.” New customers, attracted by the firm political stance, are going out of their way to share a drink at McCormack’s. Some Facebook users said they would travel from as far as New Jersey to grab a pint at the bar if it meant supporting the cause. McCormack’s advice to other small-business owners: “Don’t be scared to have an opinion.” “You don’t have to do it like I did,” McCormack told RVA. “You can be more subtle, but if we don’t speak up then we’re just the same as those people in Germany who still live with three generations of regret.” Indiana Governor Mike Braun is pushing President Donald Trump’s gerrymandering scheme forward in the Hoosier State—but Republicans still aren’t getting on the bandwagon. Braun announced Monday that he was calling a special legislative session to vote on new congressional districts, ensuring Republicans maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. “I am calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair,” he wrote in a statement. But Molly Sigart, spokesperson for Rodric Bray, the Indiana Senate’s president pro tempore, told The New Republic Monday that the votes “still aren’t there for redistricting.” The 50-member Senate has only 10 Democrat members, meaning that more than a dozen of the remaining members also opposed the plan. Last week, Bray’s office said that the Republican plan lacked the necessary support, raising red flags for Braun’s redistricting efforts. Meanwhile, Braun’s spokesperson claimed the governor was “confident” that he could secure a majority of state Senate Republicans’ support. Braun initially floated the idea last month of calling legislators back and warned that there would be “consequences” for not keeping pace with the White House’s requests for redistricting, which have already been passed in Texas, Missouri, and most recently, North Carolina. The special session Braun called Monday, which will occur before lawmakers are set to return in January, will likely cost taxpayers a pretty penny. In Indiana, things have gotten heated. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have personally connected with state Republicans about supporting a new congressional map. Last month, Indiana state Senator Jim Banks suggested that podcaster Charlie Kirk’s death was reason enough to do it. “They killed Charlie Kirk—the least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine to zero map,” Banks said. Indiana state Senator Liz Brown, an assistant majority floor leader, published a statement supporting the move Monday. “Redistricting isn’t a technical exercise. It’s power drawn on a map. And Democrats have been wielding it for decades,” wrote Brown on X. “Conservative voices have been thwarted for far too long by liberal states like Massachusetts who refuse to create competitive congressional districts.” “Gov. Braun’s decision to call our legislature into session to address redistricting is welcome news,” she wrote. Exxon is trying to claim that California’s climate laws infringe on its freedom of speech. The oil company filed a lawsuit against the state Friday over two laws, passed in 2023, that require companies doing business in California to disclose carbon emissions and climate-related financial risks, with penalties if they don’t comply. Exxon claims that the laws, known as the California Climate Accountability Package, would force the company to “serve as a mouthpiece for ideas with which it disagrees.” A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom, Tara Gallegos, told The New York Times, seemingly tongue in cheek, that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.” The laws, which will be enforced beginning next year, “have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them,” Gallegos added. Exxon said in the lawsuit that it already reports its carbon emissions and climate risks voluntarily but that the state laws would force it to change its framework to one it finds “misleading and counterproductive.” Right now, Exxon uses a methodology to calculate its emissions developed by an oil and gas industry group, but would have to change to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the research group World Resources Institute and business network World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The company claims this framework would send “the counterproductive message that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.” Exxon additionally argues that the legal requirement to report its global emissions should only be focused on the company’s emissions in the state. Exxon is also fighting against a provision in one law that requires companies to disclose how climate change threatens their business operations and what they plan to do about it. Exxon claims the law requires speculation “about unknowable future developments” and conflicts with securities laws. There is another pending lawsuit against the laws from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the American Farm Bureau Federation, with a trial expected next year. The oil company is trying to dodge transparency about its operations, perhaps concerned about how bad these disclosures would make it look. It may also be hoping for the law to be struck down by conservative judges, or even the Supreme Court. President Trump is loudly dismissive of climate change and the threats it poses, and may take further action against California on his own. Ontario Premier Doug Ford thinks that the Ronald Reagan anti-tariff commercial that set President Trump off was “the best ad I ever ran.” The TV ad featured an edited 1987 radio address from President Reagan, in which he stated that tariffs only serve to “hurt every American.” Trump was so bothered by the ad using someone he likes to compare himself to against him that he started another trade war with Canada, announcing an additional 10 percent tariff on its products over the weekend. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social to justify the tariff hike. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’” But the premier of Ontario, which produced the ad in the first place, isn’t bothered. “You know why President Trump is so upset right now? It was because it was effective,” Ford said on Monday. “The only people that win in a tariff war are the people around the world that don’t necessarily see eye to eye with us and with the United States.” Ford says the ad has received over “a billion impressions around the world.” This shared animosity underscores the schisms that Trump’s retaliatory tariffs have caused with some of America’s closest allies. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the policy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, and it’s a situation where the United States has tariffs against every one of their trading partners,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters last Friday, when Trump first began fuming about the ad. “What we can control, absolutely, is how we build here at home.… What we can also control, or at least heavily influence, is developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia, which is the focus of this trip.” Health care access could soon become a pipe dream for some Wisconsinites if Congress doesn’t muster up a budget. The government shut down 27 days ago, in large part over a debate on the merits of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, which assist individuals making upward of 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Still, neither national political party appears willing to shatter Congress’s stalemate on how to fund Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included details to slice billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid. Open enrollment for the subsidized coverage is just days away, but failing to extend the premium tax credits could raise premiums by thousands of dollars a year for people within the affected income bracket all over the country. In Wisconsin, those hardest hit could see their premiums rise by more than $30,000 per year, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers warned Monday. Age and residency also factor into eligibility for the credits. In Barron County, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 could see their premiums rise by 800 percent to an annual increase of more than $33,000. Roughly 32 percent of Barron County is above the age of 60, while 73 percent of the population makes less than $100,000 per year, according to 2020 census data. In a statement, Evers argued that the ongoing congressional failure will make “healthcare coverage costs skyrocket.” “Republicans’ reckless decisions are causing prices on everything to go up, from groceries to gas—Wisconsinites cannot afford to pay even more for healthcare, too,” Evers said. “Republicans need to end this chaos and stop working to make healthcare more expensive. It’s that simple.” But Wisconsin is far from the only state expected to suffer. As of last week, more than a dozen states had opened up their Obamacare marketplace for a window-shopping period, including California, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, Maryland, and Maine. Individuals in those states could similarly see prices rise by thousands of dollars annually. Idaho, which has roughly 135,000 enrollees on the marketplace, opened its Affordable Care Act marketplace portal Thursday with a slew of new price tags, offering the nation a glimpse into federal health care services sans federal support. More than 6 percent of the state population, roughly 13,000 people, stand to lose the premium tax credits. The mystery donor who wrote President Donald Trump a $130 million check for the military is believed to be 83-year-old conservative billionaire Tim Mellon. Two people familiar with the conversations identified Mellon to The New York Times, which published the development Saturday. Mellon inherited his fortune from his grandfather, banking magnate and former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, and he has become a major player in conservative politics in his own right over the past decade. Mellon donated a whopping $150 million to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, surpassed only by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Open Secrets. The day after Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges that same year, Mellon donated $50 million to Trump’s super PAC, one of the single largest disclosed contributions ever. With this latest donation, it’s clearer than ever that Trump’s White House has been bought and paid for by the billionaire class. But this particular payment will hardly make a dent. Split among the military’s 1.3 million service members, the donation will come out to about $100 per person. Last week, Trump announced that his administration had received a $130 million donation, and the Department of Defense confirmed that the government had accepted the money in order to “offset the cost of Service members’ salaries and benefits” under the “general gift acceptance authority.” On Friday, Trump declined to say who the donor was, only saying he was “a great American citizen” and a “substantial man” who would “prefer that his name not be mentioned.” Budget experts argued that the donation violated the Antideficiency Act, which puts barriers on the use of funds and personnel during an appropriations lapse, prohibiting the use of funds not allocated by Congress. Legal experts pointed out that Trump was already going out on a limb legally by repurposing other DOD funding to keep service members paid. A federal agent blatantly violated a court order against using excessive force against journalists and protesters last Thursday by pointing a gun in a veteran’s face, saying “Bang, bang” and “You’re dead, liberal.” The Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit representing journalists in the Chicago area, filed a complaint in federal court after the incident, which took place in the city’s Little Village neighborhood. Local residents had gathered to observe and protest a large presence of federal agents in the area, and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino did not respond well or care to take the earlier court order into consideration. According to the complaint, combat veteran Chris Gentry was “lawfully standing on the side of the road voicing his opposition as agents were driving by in their vehicles.” That’s when an agent pointed a gun at him and threatened to kill him. That was just one of many shocking incidents that day. Bovino also allegedly threw a tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters, who, according to the complaint, were not violent or committing any crimes. Some of the protesters attempted to talk to Bovino and other federal agents there and were rebuffed. Bovino and his colleagues instead shoved several people and threw more tear gas canisters at them, according to the complaint. The Department of Homeland Security claimed in a social media post that protesters “shot at agents with commercial artillery shell fireworks” and that they attacked federal agents first, which the complaint calls a lie. Further, the complaint quotes protesters who say that the crowd in Little Village was peaceful. Bovino claimed to a reporter at the scene Thursday that he was hit with a rock, but did not appear to be injured. Federal Judge Sara Ellis has ordered Bovino to appear in court Tuesday to testify about Thursday’s incidents, as well as sit for a five-hour deposition on November 5. Judging by Bovino and his fellow federal agents’ actions on Thursday, court orders and legal action don’t appear to be a deterrent. Other federal agents nationwide, particularly those working for ICE, have made violent arrests and lied about them, even dragging a four-foot-six blind man outside of a Portland detention facility and dropping him on his head earlier this month. The fatal flaw in the criminal cases against Donald Trump: credibility. Ex-special prosecutor Jack Smith’s legal team was expecting to file the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case in the nation’s capital. But in an attempt to play the case by the book, Smith surprised them by opting to file in Florida instead, where the case would have a one in six chance of landing in Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom, reported The Washington Post’s Carol Leonnig and Aaron C. Davis in their book, Injustice. “Are you all fucking insane?” David Raskin, a federal prosecutor who had worked on the case, blurted out in a Justice Department hallway at the time, according to the Post. Smith believed then that filing in Florida could place the case on firmer legal footing, reducing the possibility that the most egregious charges could be overturned down the line. Smith further trusted that even if the case was randomly assigned to Cannon, they would be able to prove Trump was guilty by sheer volume of evidence. “I’m not worried about Florida,” Smith told Justice Department officials while presenting his decision. Instead, once the case was in her hands, Cannon blatantly took steps to drag it out and turn the tide in Trump’s favor. A year on, the decision to bring the case to Cannon’s doorstep has been interpreted as the case’s death knell. The quest to bring Trump to justice for his alleged crimes disintegrated by election night 2024, by which point the MAGA leader had managed to transform the myriad cases against him into supposed evidence that he was being unfairly prosecuted by a Democratic presidential administration and its DOJ. Trump has since rejiggered the Justice Department in his image, leveraging its heft to prosecute his own perceived political enemies, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former special counsel James Comey. His next target is California Senator Adam Schiff. Smith has also become the subject of conservative-centric controversies. Republican lawmakers accused the former special prosecutor earlier this month of spying on them during his investigation of Trump, claiming Smith tapped their phone lines and monitored their phone calls. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley dubbed the right-wing scandal “worse than Watergate.” Smith and his team have vehemently denied those allegations, clarifying in a letter that they obtained telephone toll records, which only contain information pertaining to incoming and outgoing phone numbers and call duration. They do not contain any details of a call’s contents. Smith conducted two parallel investigations into Trump, both of which resulted in indictments. They centered on allegations that Trump mishandled and retained classified records after the end of his first presidential term, and his alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty on all charges before the charges were dropped altogether after the 2024 election due to Justice Department policy that prevents the prosecution of a sitting president.

Title: Amazon to cut 30,000 corporate jobs — 9% of worldwide office workforce: report

Amazon will slash 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday, according to a report — unleashing one of the US’s biggest job bloodbaths this century as the company aggressively revamps its business with artificial intelligence. Sources told Reuters the reductions — which amount to 9% of Amazon’s global office-based workforce of 350,000 — will begin Tuesday and could unfold over several weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Seattle-based web giant’s sweeping layoffs mark the biggest in a series of major contractions for the company, which has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since CEO Andy Jassy took over from the company’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. In 2022 and 2023, Jassy cut a total of 27,000 jobs, Reuters reported. Those cuts targeted Amazon Web Services, its devices group and entertainment units including Prime Video and Twitch. Reuters reported that this week’s layoffs could reach across multiple departments, among them human resources — known internally as the People Experience and Technology group — as well as devices, services and operations. Managers in affected areas were instructed Monday to complete training sessions on how to brief employees once email notifications start going out Tuesday morning, sources told Reuters. The latest reductions come as Amazon doubles down on artificial intelligence and robotics — technologies Jassy has described as central to the company’s next phase of growth. In a companywide email in June, Jassy warned employees to embrace automation or risk being left behind, writing that those who “become conversant in AI” would be best positioned to “help us reinvent the company.” He also acknowledged that Amazon expected “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company” that would reduce the corporate workforce. “AI is allowing Amazon to cut major costs and playing a key role here around efficiency along with other cost cuts,” Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities, told The Post. Earlier this month, Fortune reported that Amazon was preparing to cut up to 15% of its People eXperience and Technology division, known internally as PXT — a 10,000-person unit that includes recruiting and HR tech teams. Those layoffs are believed to be part of the new 30,000 total. The scale of the latest cuts positions Amazon among the largest corporate downsizers of 2025, alongside Meta and Google parent Alphabet, which have also trimmed staff as AI investments reshape the tech industry. The company has been aggressively reining in costs while committing more than $100 billion in capital spending this year to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure. Amazon’s push to automate its operations has intensified in recent months. Internal strategy documents reviewed by The New York Times showed the company aims to replace more than 500,000 jobs with robots and automate 75% of its fulfillment operations by 2033. Executives have told the board that automation could allow Amazon to avoid hiring hundreds of thousands of additional workers in the US while doubling sales volume. Amazon said at the time that the internal documents did not represent its official hiring strategy and that the company would continue to create new jobs in logistics and technology. Jassy’s cost-cutting measures have included mandatory return-to-office policies, stricter performance management and an annual process known internally as “unregretted attrition,” which encourages managers to push out underperformers. The company’s corporate workforce ballooned during the pandemic as online shopping surged. Since then, Jassy has sought to reverse that expansion while redirecting resources toward more profitable segments like AWS and advertising. Amazon’s stock has risen about 20% over the past year but remains volatile amid investor scrutiny over its long-term profitability. While corporate layoffs loom, Amazon said it still plans to hire 250,000 seasonal warehouse and delivery workers for the holiday rush — most of them temporary roles. Jassy has been pursuing a broad campaign to streamline Amazon’s management structure, arguing that the company had become weighed down by unnecessary layers of oversight. Earlier this year, he said an anonymous feedback channel created to flag inefficiencies had drawn about 1,500 submissions and prompted more than 450 process changes.

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor UPDATED with confirmation: Amazon has confirmed it’s laying off 14,000 people in a major reduction of its corporate workforce, citing the advance of AI. Looking ahead to 2026, the company it expects “there will be additional places where we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains” as it continues to review its operations. In a memo shared publicly today, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said leaders will communicate with impacted teams and individuals today. Watch on Deadline “Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams – explaining how we want to operate like the world’s largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers,” Galetti wrote, referring to CEO Andy Jassy. “Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We’re already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you’ve done. The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Reports yesterday said the company was targeting as many as 30,000 positions. It’s not clear where the total number will land but it’s shaping up to be one of the biggest round of cuts in the company’s history.. The memo said said Amazon is offering employees 90 days to look for a new role internally and recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles. “For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.” PREVIOUSLY: Amazon is planning a heavy wave of layoffs starting Tuesday impacting as many as 30,000 corporate jobs, according to a Reuters report. The e-commerce and web services giant and parent of Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video is still working to pare down after over hiring during Covid. The cuts will likely cut across divisions. Layoffs of that degree would represent roughly 10% of the company’s 350,000 corporate employees. Its total global workforce, of some 1.5 million full time and part time, is much larger and comprised largely of warehouse employees. Reuters said the cuts would represent the largest round of layoffs at Amazon since some 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022, and that managers are undergoing training Monday on communicating with staff ahead of pink slips that will begin to hit email inboxes Tuesday morning. Other reports said the total number hasn’t yet been determined. RELATED: Amazon Reorganizes Audio Divisions, Shrinking Wondery Studio And Laying Off 100-Plus Staffers Amazon in August reorganized its audio divisions, laying off more than 100 workers and dramatically narrowing the scope of its Wondery studio. It January of 2024, it laid off several hundred employees across Prime Video and Amazon Studios as part of a review of its business. Amazon reps were’t immediately available to comment. The report comes as the company is one of several circling Warner Bros. Discovery, which formally put itself up for sale last week after receiving interest from multiple parties. It wasn’t clear if the cuts were AI-related, but CEO Andy Jassy has warned that Generative AI will change the way work is done at the company. It will require “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he said in a memo to staff in June.

Title: Amazon to Cut as Much as 9% of White Collar Workforce: Report
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-to-cut-as-much-as-9-of-white-collar-workforce-report-2000677605
Time Published: 2025-10-27T20:25:57Z

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Update 10/28: On Tuesday, Amazon announced that it will be cutting 14,000 corporate workers. In a message to employees, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, said: Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business. In other words, she’s saying Amazon is cutting jobs because of AI, but in an exciting way! The affected employees will have a chance to fight for a new position at the company. Galletti said that Amazon will be “offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally” and “recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” This is an update to a previous post on projected layoffs at the e-commerce giant. You can read the original article below. Amazon plans to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday morning, according to a new report from Reuters that cites three unnamed people familiar with the matter. Amazon has 1.5 million employees globally (1.2 million in the U.S.), but about 350,000 of those are corporate positions, according to Reuters. Cutting 30,000 corporate jobs represents almost 9% of Amazon’s total corporate positions. The Reuters report cited overhiring from the pandemic as the impetus of the cuts, but not everyone seems convinced by that argument, given the fact that companies have had plenty of time to tinker with their staffing since the onset of covid in 2020. The last massive job cuts at Amazon saw 27,000 people let go in late 2022. Analysts on CNBC debated what was behind the news on Monday, with two other likely culprits: the rise of AI and President Donald Trump’s extreme tariffs. There was strong debate for and against the case that the reported job cuts were coming due to AI, but nobody seems to really know yet. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to Gizmodo’s questions about the Reuters report emailed Monday. The case of tariffs is easier to make, given the fact that President Trump has been so erratic in implementing them, slapping foreign goods with historically high import taxes. Just this weekend, Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canada because he was upset about an ad purchased on U.S. airwaves by the premier of Ontario that featured old footage of President Ronald Reagan warning against tariffs. Trump claimed the ad was AI-generated, which isn’t true. The New York Times reported last week that Amazon has ambitious plans for robotics that will help it grow without expanding its workforce. The goal is to automate 75% of Amazon’s operations, according to the report, which could mean that it won’t have to hire 600,000 new workers it would’ve otherwise needed by 2033. Automation has always caused job losses over the past century, whether it’s physical machines in factories or software that can improve the efficiency of white collar workers. But the hype around AI has created a new cycle in the 2020s that has everyone holding their breath. Will generative artificial intelligence prove to be a massive job killer, or will workers adapt to other positions, and things will become more efficient? Nobody knows where it will go, obviously, even as many people predict that the AI bubble is about to burst. Anyone who knows how things will play out (and has some money to burn) has the potential to earn some big bucks in the weeks and months ahead. Some big names are reporting earnings this week, including Amazon (Thursday), Alphabet (Wednesday), and Microsoft (Wednesday). Wall Street liked the news on Monday that Amazon was cutting jobs, as it often does. The stock closed up 1.25%. The DOW, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all closed at record highs.

Title: Paramount Skydance to Lay Off 1,000 Employees This Week, With Additional Cuts Expected Later
URL: https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/paramount-skydance-layoffs-start-1236561992/

Layoffs are coming down at Paramount Skydance this week, with the freshly merged company looking to slash approximately 1,000 jobs primarily in the U.S. on Wednesday, Oct. 29, Variety has confirmed. Following this week’s cuts, more layoffs are expected at a later date, a source familiar with the plans said. Paramount Skydance, headed by chairman and CEO David Ellison, is undertaking a series of deep staffing cuts that are expected to eliminate a total of around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional layoffs taking place internationally. Related Stories Why the 'Stranger Things' Spinoff Series Will Have 'New Characters' and a 'Clean Slate': 'It's So Different Than "Star Wars"’ 'Splinter Cell: Deathwatch' Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix A rep for Paramount Skydance declined to comment. The company’s layoff plans for this week were reported earlier by Bloomberg. Popular on Variety Major job cuts have been expected even before the Skydance Media-Paramount Global deal closed, as part of a stated goal of slashing upwards of $2 billion in costs. At an Aug. 7 press conference in New York after the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger officially closed, Jeff Shell, the ex-CEO of NBCUniversal who is now president of Paramount Skydance, told reporters that the company would make cost cuts and layoffs as swiftly as possible and be disclosed by the company’s third-quarter 2025 earnings report to investors in November. Paramount Skydance will report Q3 financial results on Nov. 10 after the market closes. Ellison, founder of Skydance Media, has grand ambitions for the entertainment giant. They include a possible second deal for Warner Bros. Discovery that would transform the combined company into a sprawling rival that might better compete with streaming giants like Netflix and newcomers to the entertainment space such as Apple and Amazon, which have invested heavily in entertainment. So far, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected his overtures. Since taking over Paramount, Ellison has opened his wallet. Paramount shelled out $7 billion for an exclusive seven-year deal for the rights to UFC. The company also recently lured the Duffer Brothers, the creators of “Stranger Things,” over from Netflix with a new four-year exclusive pact to make movies, shows and streaming programming. Some of Ellison’s moves have been more controversial, such as his purchase of the right-leaning outlet The Free Press for a reported $150 million and decision to install its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News despite her lack of television experience. Ellison, the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, has signaled a willingness to be aggressive. However, Paramount is grappling with the same issues that are plaguing other media giants. Namely, revenues are falling as viewers have shifted away from cable and broadcast television towards streaming and the theatrical film business has yet to recover from Covid.
