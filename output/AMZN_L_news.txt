Editions: En/basketball/nba ESPN cuts ties with Zach Lowe Zach Lowe is a well-known figure in the basketball world, celebrated for his sharp analysis and insightful commentary on the NBA. As a senior writer for ESPN, he built a reputation over his more than ten years with the network, having first joined Bill Simmons' Grantland in 2012. Lowe's journey through the world of sports journalism has been marked by his keen understanding of the game, as well as his ability to break down complex strategies in a way that fans can appreciate. He also hosted the popular Lowe Post podcast and frequently appeared on NBA Today, making him a familiar face to basketball enthusiasts everywhere. Unfortunately, the latest buzz in sports media reveals that Lowe is no longer with ESPN. According to Andrew Marchand from The Athletic, Lowe's dismissal was part of a wave of layoffs that has recently hit the network, which also saw notable departures like Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder just before the football season kicked off. Reports suggest that Lowe's salary-over a million dollars a year-was a significant factor in the decision to let him go. As one insider noted, "His salary was the biggest factor in his dismissal from ESPN," highlighting the tough choices networks face in today's changing media landscape. Despite this setback, there might be a silver lining for Lowe. With NBC and Amazon ramping up their NBA coverage in anticipation of new rights agreements in 2025, opportunities could be on the horizon. Both networks are keen to bring in top-notch talent, and Lowe's experience and credibility in the field make him a prime candidate for their future plans. Interestingly, this shake-up in the sports media world comes on the heels of a surprising announcement from another basketball luminary, Adrian Wojnarowski. Woj, ESPN's lead NBA reporter, revealed his departure to become the general manager of St. Bonaventure's men's basketball team. In a heartfelt message posted on X, he shared, "This craft transformed my life," expressing his appreciation for the journey that sports journalism has taken him on. As for Lowe, while the road ahead may seem uncertain, his contributions to the NBA discourse have been invaluable, and his passion for the game will surely lead him to new and exciting ventures. The basketball community will be watching closely to see where this talented writer lands next. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us

Title: Amazon Employees Are Overwhelmingly ‘Dissatisfied’ With CEO Andy Jassy’s RTO Mandate

The majority of Amazon (AMZN) employees are overwhelmingly unhappy with CEO Andy Jassy’s new return-to-office (RTO) mandate and are considering looking for new jobs, according to a recent survey conducted by Team Blind, an anonymous social platform for verified tech workers. A poll of more than 2,500 Amazon employees found that 91 percent are “dissatisfied” with the new five-day in-office policy, which will come into effect in January 2025. “My morale for this job is gone,” one said in a post. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Like most other tech companies, Amazon embraced remote work during the pandemic and has since reverted to a three-day in-office policy. Now, in an effort to rebuild the company’s culture and boost collaboration, Jassy’s RTO measure will only allow employees to work from home under extenuating circumstances like illnesses. The change will help ensure Amazon operates “like the world’s largest startup,” according to the CEO. Amazon employees don’t appear to share Jassy’s sentiments. Blind’s survey was conducted between Sept. 17 (a day after Jassy announced the RTO mandate) to Sept. 19 and found that three quarters of polled workers are considering looking for another job because of the new policy, while 32 percent said they know someone who has quit recently in response to Jassy’s mandate. Amazon’s HR is scrambling to fill the void. “I just had an Amazon recruiter blow up my phone and inbox five times in the last 24 hours to get me to provide my availability for an onsite interview,” said a Microsoft (MSFT) employee on Blind, adding that the recruiter said hiring managers are frustrated by the amount of Amazon candidates who have dropped out of interview processes in response to the news. For Amazon employees who were hired remotely, some are viewing the mandate as a thinly veiled strategy to cut headcount. The company’s workforce reportedly surged by nearly 75 percent between March 2020 and September 2021 alone. “Many of those folks are concerned that they don’t live anywhere close to an office, and they were hired with the expectation of being remote,” Rick Chen, Blind’s head of public relations, told Observer. Only a small percentage of employees are okay with RTO, with 9 percent saying they are “satisfied” with Jassy’s mandate. “There were some defenders of the policy, folks that prefer to work in the office and disliked remote work,” said Chen, who noted that a few Amazon employees also suggested that the end of remote work was caused by a few “bad apples'” who “ruined it for everyone by taking quiet vacations or slacking off.” Another trending response to Amazon’s RTO policy is concern amongst other Big Tech workers that their company is next. In addition to worried employees from Apple (AAPL), Meta (META) and Google (GOOGL), all of which also currently have a three-day in-office policy, Microsoft professionals—who are allowed to work remotely 50 percent of the time—have overwhelmingly voiced concerns that Microsoft will follow Amazon’s lead, according to Chen. This could be due to a geographic connection, as both Amazon and Microsoft are based near Seattle, Wash., he said. Such comments echo those made in 2022 and 2023 when large tech companies announced layoffs one after the other, said Chen. “The was a feeling among professionals then, and it’s resurfacing now, that these companies are moving in lockstep with one another.” Blind has noticed an unusual uptick in search volume for the term “RTO” since Jassy’s announcement. While the phrase was previously searched by 500 employees on a daily basis at the beginning of 2024, that figure has since doubled this month to 1,000, Chen said. Other keywords like “remote work” and “flexible work” have also gained popularity in lieu of previously common search terms like “layoffs,” “manager” and “promotion.” “It’s a very extreme shift in terms of what is capturing Amazon professionals’ mind space right now,” said Chen.

Title: ESPN Laid Off Zach Lowe In Latest Shakeup To Their NBA Coverage

In the past year-plus, ESPN has made some massive changes to their NBA coverage team. A year ago, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson were all let go as part of company-wide layoffs. Doc Rivers stepped in to the lead booth along with Doris Burke but left for the Bucks head coaching job midseason. JJ Redick was elevated into Rivers’ spot, but promptly took the Lakers job at the end of the season. Most recently, the league’s top newsbreaker, Adrian Wojnarowski, announced his shocking retirement to go work for his beloved alma mater, St. Bonaventure. With Woj already gone, another bomb dropped on Thursday when The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand brought word that ESPN was also laying off its top NBA writer and podcaster, Zach Lowe. Per Marchand, Lowe being let go falls in line with the Robert Griffin III and Samantha Ponder departures earlier this year, as Lowe made north of seven figures annually and was fired for budget reasons. Lowe was the most prominent NBA writer not only on ESPN’s staff, but arguably in the entire league. Beyond his written work, Lowe’s podcast, The Lowe Post, has been extremely popular and he has been a regular contributor on TV with NBA Today and other studio shows. Lowe had been at ESPN for more than a decade, starting his career at Grantland and then moving over to the dot com after they shuttered the Bill Simmons-led site. As such, many would expect the Ringer to be a potential landing spot for Lowe, who immediately becomes the most sought after free agent in the NBA writing and podcasting space. He also could be in play for NBC and Amazon, as they both get set to be new national broadcast partners of the NBA in 2025-26. As for ESPN, they are now tasked with not only reshaping their NBA coverage on the TV side, still needing to figure out their lead booth and the potential domino effect that will have on their other game broadcasts, but also their written coverage with Lowe and Woj both gone.

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge — and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Title: Why moves by Amazon and comments by Jamie Dimon don’t threaten an end to remote work benefits | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn’t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week. Or that Dell in a memo asked its global sales team employees who are able to work from a company office to do so five days a week, up from three previously, and noting that “working remotely should be the exception rather than the routine.” Or when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week — which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit. Or even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren’t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as “empty,” according to various news reports. Whenever big players publicly change direction and require employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit. But for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don’t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits. In the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy’s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture. But, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more “layers,” including “a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,” he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” Related article How can you prevent being laid off? You can’t. Here’s why Normally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is “not the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,” the company told CNN, noting that it has “no plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.” But by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, “middle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say ‘I’m leaving,’” said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives. That saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily. Jassy’s risk is that too many managers could quit. “He will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,” Williams said. If so, that may require Amazon to eventually — and quietly — back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested. While an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that’s not happening widely. Workplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022. As of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that’s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director. Related article Deciding what to do when your employer changes the rules on remote work A Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent. So it’s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be “extremely likely” to look for another job “if your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.” Many CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time. Williams noted: “I have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.” Reuters contributed reporting to this article.

Title: Things are looking up for the economy. So why are consumers still unhappy?

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Gen Z are ‘conscious unbossing’—they’re avoiding stressful middle management roles

Tech giants have spent the last two years culling their middle managers. Amazon was the latest to send theirs to the chopping block just last week. Now, Gen Zers don’t even want to climb the greasy pole. In fact, 72% of the youngest generation of workers say they’d rather progress in an individual contributor role than become middle managers, according to the recruitment firm Robert Walters. Although just 16% of the 3,600 Gen Zers surveyed said that they will avoid middle management at all cost, it’s clear that the majority of young people today aren’t keen on the idea of managing others. Over half of Gen Zers expressed that they don’t want to be middle managers, as part of a trend that has been dubbed ‘conscious unbossing.’ Even the 36% of respondents who said they do anticipate stepping into a managerial position at some point in their careers, admitted they don’t actually want to. It’s not that Gen Z workers don’t want success—they’d just rather it didn’t come with the responsibility of managing others. Lucy Bisset, a director at Robert Walters, said that Gen Z prefers to bring their “whole self to projects and spend time cultivating their own brand and approach, rather than spending time managing others.” A clear example of this is the rise in young people ditching the corporate rat race to become their own boss—or an influencer. According to LinkedIn, the second fastest-growing job title among Gen Z grads right now is “founder.” Read more from Fortune –Sam Altman says it’s relentless and all-consuming to run OpenAI teams after shock CTO departure –YouTube’s MrBeast looks for ‘obsessed’ employees to help run his $700 million company, per leaked handbook –Here’s what actually makes employees happy and more likely to stay at their jobs –Laurene Powell Jobs is one of Kamala Harris’s biggest bankrollers—and closest friends –‘As painful as disruption is, it’s not negotiable’ says CarMax’s CEO Meanwhile, separate data shows that more than half of Gen Z say they would become full-time influencers if they had the opportunity, and the percentage has only gone up in surveys dating back to 2019. “My generation don’t want to go work a consulting or banking job. They don’t even want to be an astronaut anymore,” Steven Schwartz, the Gen Z founder and CEO of the multimillion-dollar marketplace Whop previously told Fortune. “They want to make content online, they want to find customers online… Being educated with more information about what people can do, why would they want to do something that isn’t the most elite experience and the most fun for them?” Really, it’s hard to know whether Gen Zers would actually turn down management roles. With the oldest of the generation turning 27 this year, many won’t have been offered the opportunity to step up yet—but it’s hardly surprising they’ve been put off. Having joined the world of work during tech company’s quest for “efficiency,” Gen Z has repeatedly been sent the message that middle managers are disposable. At Google, where 12,000 managers lost their jobs last year, workers have been told it will be harder to get promoted into management roles going forward. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Zuckerberg said that “flattening” its internal hierarchy was core to its restructure last year. He credited Elon Musk as the source of inspiration behind having “fewer layers of management.” In fact, middle-management positions accounted for almost one-third of layoffs in 2023, Bloomberg found, up from 20% in 2018—and the “great unbossing” trend hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he wants to “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15%” (by cutting the number of managers at the tech giant). What’s more, even middle managers who haven’t been laid off are opting to walk out of the role. Earlier this year, a global study found that 75% of millennial managers feel overwhelmed, stressed, and burnt out. As a result, many are eyeing the exit and looking for non-management gigs. Is it any wonder that when Robert Waters asked young people why they’re turning their noses up at middle management jobs, nearly 70% responded: “Too high stress, low reward.” “Those new to middle management experience a steep step-up in workload, further expectations to be ‘always available’ to those they manage, as well continuing pressure to hit their own targets,” Bisset explained. “It’s clear how these roles can prove overwhelming and deter many from taking on the extra responsibility.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Future of TV Briefing: How publishers are turning podcasts into video talk shows

Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 Last chance: Secure your pass for the Digiday Media Buying Summit | Oct. 15-17 This Future of TV Briefing covers the latest in streaming and TV for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → This week’s Future of TV Briefing looks at how Overtime and Vox Media are adapting their podcasts into long-form videos. Honestly, I thought video podcasts were just a fad. And obviously, I was wrong. Way wrong. More than 170 million people have watched a video podcast on Spotify, per the company, and YouTube has become the “most used” platform for consuming podcasts, according to a study by Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights. All of which is to say: Podcasts are becoming largely video productions. As a result, podcast publishers are having to sort out how to adapt podcasts into videos. Sure, they can just hook up a show’s RSS feed to YouTube and have the audio play over a static image of the podcast’s thumbnail image. But then that’s not really a video podcast. “There is a version of a video show that you could do, say, on YouTube that is a static image and just a long-form audio bed underneath it. That doesn’t feel as native to the platform, even though people do consume that way. And so as we think about podcasts as like a modern talk show – our chat podcasts at least – we are thinking about what’s native to the different platforms where they appear,” said Nishat Kurwa, svp and executive producer for podcasts at Vox Media, which has been producing video podcasts since The Verge’s Vergecast debuted in November 2011. Making video podcasts native to platforms like YouTube means making sure a video podcast is as much a video as a podcast. There are some basic elements, like filming the hosts and guests. But simply recording a Zoom session or setting up a single camera in a podcast studio doesn’t necessarily suffice. “It’s important for us to be cutting and changing the layout of the screen, just to keep the user engaged. That’s one thing that you never need to think about for audio, vs. on video, it’s like, ‘How is there some type of change every once in a while so that people are not just looking at the same type of image for too long?’” said Sam Gordon, editor-in-chief of Overtime, which started producing long-form video podcasts roughly six months ago and has accumulated 55 million views on YouTube for those podcasts in the past two months. Much of the answer to that question depends on how the podcast is recorded. If done entirely in person, then a best practice is to set up three cameras on set: one focused on the host, one focused on the guest(s) or cohost and one set at a wide angle to show all parties. “That way we always have two angles that we can pull from for any given person,” said Gordon. In-person recordings also open up production design opportunities to create visual interest on the set. For example, Sue Bird’s and Megan Rapinoe’s podcast with Vox Media, “A Touch More,” originated as an Instagram Live series recorded at home. So the video podcast is filmed in one of Vox Media’s studios on a set “that looks like a cozy room,” said Kurwa. If recorded remotely via Zoom or another video conferencing platform, creating visual interest can be trickier. Webcam-quality clips are often of lower resolution than what people are accustomed to watching on YouTube, especially as more of YouTube’s watch time takes place on TV screens. This is where graphics become the unsung workhorse of the video podcast. “You can add a lot of personality with graphics,” said Kurwa. Overtime, for example, has graphics packages for each of its shows recorded via Zoom. These graphics enable the Zoom recordings to be inset as opposed to scaled up to cover the entire screen and enlarge the lower image quality. Additionally, Overtime sometimes adds motion to the graphics that add depth and life to the shot. “We also have graphics where we can show multiple camera angles at once. If you go full screen, and it’s half one [clip] and half the other, it’s not visually engaging,” Gordon said. Vox Media similarly enlists its design team to create custom visuals and motion graphics for its video podcasts. “We map out what the segments are going to be in the show. We talk to the design team about some recurring templates that we think we’re going to use, whether that’s the segment title cards or recurring motion graphics that we think will be useful to have over time,” Kurwa said. Minding the visual as well as aural quality of podcasts is also reshaping the skillsets of those working on podcasts. Case in point: Production assistants on the Vox Media Podcast Network’s production team have historically been responsible for pulling archival audio clips and now are being asked to also pull b-roll video clips. “We are seeing the future of podcasts as multi-platform shows. I think that is a skillset that’s really beneficial for podcast producers to have, so that they can be more versatile in the jobs of now, the jobs of the future, and be more of an asset to more kinds of productions,” Kurwa said. “It’s: Speak out, but don’t speak out if you want to pay your rent, but speak out if you want to be a morally accepted creator, but don’t speak out if you want to be able to pay your bills.” Thanks to the Summer Olympics airing across traditional TV and streaming, people spent more time watching NBCUniversal properties on their TV screens in August than any other media company’s, according to Nielsen’s latest Media Distributor Gauge viewership report. NBCUniversal’s upswing didn’t necessarily come at a cost to all other companies’ watch time shares.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg is now in an exclusive club with only two other members: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos

It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position. But now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year. Zuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion. This places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. “I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we’re going to win,” Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. “We’re going to build a better product than everyone else because we’re going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.” Read more from Fortune –Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees –In comments reigniting Tim Cook feud, Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple –LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI. Here’s how to stop it –Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls –Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla says AI will handle 80% of work in 80% of jobs While Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday. Zuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year. “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2. While AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant. “This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: About 40% Of Jobs In U.S. Book Publishing Have Disappeared Since 1997

After a year when publishing industry layoffs have frequently been in the headlines, it will surprise no one that the total number of jobs in the industry is in decline. But in an era marked by corporate consolidation, increased competition for consumer attention, and the emergence of alternative publishing models, the most recent government data suggests the loss of publishing jobs over the past three decades has been dramatic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people employed in book publishing in the United States fell to 54,822 in 2023, down from 91,100 in 1997. If accurate, that represents a loss of about 40% of traditional publishing jobs in less than 30 years. The BLS stats are drawn from detailed employment data for book publishers, which, according to the agency, includes businesses that “carry out design, editing, and marketing activities necessary for producing and distributing books,” whether “in print, electronic, or audio form.” In 1990, the BLS recorded total book publishing employment at 85,800. Employment then peaked at 91,100 in June 1997, and was at 84,600 as late as December 2008. But the number of industry jobs appears not to have rebounded from the retooling that followed the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In 2012, employment had dropped to roughly 70,000, and in 2016 to approximately 60,000. The annual average bottomed out in 2021 at 51,161, down an eye-opening 44% from the BLS’s peak. In 2023—the most recent stats, released last month—employment has rebounded slightly, to 54,822. Notably, about 20% of publishing industry employment in 2016—10,269 jobs—was in New York City. In 2023, that number had slipped to 9,540, or about 17.4% of the publishing workforce. While government figures show that full-time employment in book publishing has been in decline since the 1990s, context is key. There have been significant shifts, including new technology and consolidation, that make it difficult to compare today’s publishing industry to the industry that existed three decades ago. For example, a 1992 report produced by Simba Information listed 20 companies across all publishing segments with sales of at least $200 million. Of those 20 publishers, 10 exist today, having swallowed up the other 10. And with every acquisition comes integration and a consequent net loss of jobs as companies improve their operating efficiencies. Indeed, publishing has become more efficient in the digital age. After all, despite the significant decline in publishing jobs, industry sales are still growing—although that growth is not keeping up with inflation, and even in absolute terms it appears to be slowing. During the 1990s, for example, sales growth in publishing exceeded 5% annually. By the early 2000s, it had slowed to about 1.5% per year and hit $25 billion in 2007, according to data from the Association of American Publishers. Meanwhile, the most recent AAP numbers show sales in 2023 were $29.9 billion. While publishing industry data is notoriously tricky to pin down given shifting accounting methods and data sources, the trend lines are nevertheless clear: book publishing employment has dropped by about a third, and sales have ticked up modestly. Certainly, profitability has improved. At the 2022 U.S. Book Show, Morgan Entrekin, longtime head of Grove Atlantic, pointed to the growing pressure on publishers—especially publicly traded ones—to deliver higher margins. “In 46 years, [trade book publishers have] never seen these levels of profitability,” he said, noting that historically, profit margins in the 5% range were seen as a healthy return. Today, the four of the Big Five trade publishers that report their financial results (next year it will be three with S&S now private) typically have margins above 10%. Traditional publishing has also ceded territory to new models. For example, digital self-publishing began to make its presence felt around 2007 with the launch of Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing. According to Bowker, in 2021 the number of self-published books—including e-books, print books, and digital audio—jumped to nearly three million, from just over 500,000 in 2011. Of course, self-publishing sales data is scarcer and more unreliable than data for the traditional publishing industry. Amazon recently revealed that in the 10 years Kindle Unlimited has been active, KDP authors have earned more than $3.5 billion in royalties, with more than $650 million of that coming in just the past 12 months. When you add in à la carte sales of self-published print and e-books by KDP authors as well as sales from other players in the self-publishing field, total self-publishing sales could be well north of $3 billion annually. But how many people would say they are employed in self-publishing? More to the point, where do they factor into publishing industry statistics? Few self-published authors are in the game full-time. And it is unlikely in any case that Amazon and the myriad other self-publishing companies (BookBaby, Draft2Digital, IngramSpark, and Lulu among them), which all run lean, have absorbed a significant number of the job losses reported by the BLS. Then there is the anecdotal evidence, which suggests that some of the “efficiency” realized by book publishers today has been achieved on the backs of staff: fewer full-time editors, designers, and production personnel, with more work shifted to the assistant level or outsourced to freelancers foreign and domestic—labor that would not be counted in the government’s statistics on publishing industry employment. With all the shifts of the past few decades, are the BLS stats an accurate portrait of the publishing industry job market? It’s hard to say. Surely no one in the industry would dispute that their ranks are shrinking, however. And what is certain is that the structure of employment in publishing has changed dramatically—a trend that is likely to continue. Loading...

Title: It's the 'year of the mandate' at offices, but hybrid and remote work aren't dying

Related Stories Amazon isn't the only major company cracking down on remote work — the tech giant joins other companies, including Citigroup, Walmart and UPS, in requiring workers to spend more time in offices in recent months. Even so, the share of people working remotely and hybrid has ticked up in the last year, while those working from an office full-time declined, according to a new report. Some 27% of workers say they work in a hybrid arrangement, up from 26% in 2023, according to a survey of 2,000 knowledge workers from Owl Labs, the video-conferencing technology maker. Another 11% say they work fully remotely, up from 7% in the last year, according to the report. The remaining 62% say they work from a physical office five days a week, down from 66% this time last year. It's "a surprise" to see remote and hybrid work increase slightly in what's shaping up to be "the year of the mandate," says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. But hybrid workers continue to face challenges in what they want versus what their employers require. Most say they prefer to be in-office three days a week (33%) followed by two (20%), but the most common in-office schedules actually require three (41%) or four (32%) days a week. Companies are also increasing their efforts to track employees' attendance during the week. Nearly half of employees say their employer has added or increased the use of employee tracking software to gather activity data in the past year. And workers say their employers are stricter about enforcing attendance policies (like being fired for noncompliance) now, compared with 2022, according to data from WFH Research. However, "the issue with strict attendance policies is that they can become unenforceable," says Jose Maria Barrero, co-founder of WFH Research and assistant professor at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Business School. "If employees work from home effectively, and there is no real reason for them to come into the office other than 'it is just the policy,' will managers really punish them?" he says. "Are you willing to piss off a good employee and potentially push them to find a different job if their work is otherwise up to standard?" Some business leaders may create strict office policies to get people to quit and avoid layoffs, he says, "but I'm skeptical that they would take a hard line if things are working well." On the employee side, there's been "a severe backlash" to many attendance and tracking efforts, says Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry. "Employees want autonomy and feeling like they're not being micromanaged." When set up effectively, tracking policies and tools can "enhance transparency and performance," Vyas says. "But I feel like it's a bit invasive. It can actually erode trust, which is something really crucial in any workplace." In fact, 73% of professionals say employee-tracking initiatives like monitoring badge swipes and computer activity are not necessary or helpful, according to a recent Glassdoor poll of 1,400 users. However, Weishaupt expects 2025 will see a continuation of more RTO mandates, tracking software and badging enforcement, despite Owl Labs' and other data indicating that "employees want flexibility," he says. "And I think that will create a trust barrier between employers and employees." Want to master your money this fall? Sign up for CNBC's new online course.

Title: Qualcomm has good reasons to bid for Intel — but a takeover probably won't happen

If Qualcomm sees it through, its takeover of Intel would likely be the biggest in Silicon Valley history. While it has good reasons to go after the storied chip giant, a lot is working against it. The possibility of Intel handing its 56-year history over to a younger rival emerged last week after several reports said that the California semiconductor firm Qualcomm had approached it for a takeover. Qualcomm is no newbie in Silicon Valley. It was founded in 1985, 39 years ago. Since then, it has grown into a company worth over $188 billion, specializing in areas such as wireless networks, smartphone processors, and modems. But recent trouble brewing at Intel, a longtime chip designer and manufacturer, has apparently given Qualcomm reason to consider acquiring a company that has lost more than half its value this year and dropped to a market capitalization of just over $93 billion. While some of its top competitors, like Nvidia, have soared to new heights as a result of the generative-AI boom, Intel has struggled to capitalize on investor interest in the technology. It has also grappled with production and strategy challenges. The company took a serious tumble in August — a month in which it lost almost $30 billion in market value — after announcing the layoffs of 15,000 employees and a suspension of its dividend from the fourth quarter of this year. It's worth noting that Qualcomm's talks to take over this troubled business are very early stage and exploratory. A person close to Qualcomm told the Financial Times that the company "would only pursue a friendly deal." For some, the logic to pursue the deal is apparent. Speaking on CNBC last week, Patrick Moorhead, an industry analyst, said Intel's exposure to key areas like data centers and the PC market, as well as its chip-manufacturing capabilities — which Qualcomm lacks as it outsources that process to Taiwan's TSMC — meant there were "synergies in this." The company has also taken steps that seem to make it a more attractive purchase. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced a set of drastic measures last week to bring change to the company that could set it on a brighter path. He said these included a "multi-year, multi-billion-dollar" deal to work on custom chip designs with the tech heavyweight Amazon Web Services, a pause on plans to build plants in Europe, and the separation of its manufacturing unit, Intel Foundry, into its own entity. That said, not everyone is convinced that Qualcomm needs Intel — or that a buyout would be a good idea for either company. Richard Windsor, an equity-research analyst and the founder of Radio Free Mobile, thinks that while "it is possible to see how Qualcomm and Intel could fit together" — one company designs chips and the other has factories — a lot of Intel's bits wouldn't fit so well. "The vultures are hovering around Intel and while Intel will make a tasty and nutritious meal for some, I think Intel would end up sticking in Qualcomm's crop and give it a bad case of indigestion," he wrote in a note on Monday. He points to a few key reasons. Intel's x86 processors lag behind Qualcomm's and its rival firm Arm's offerings. Redesigning chips to be made by Intel "sounds like a risky proposition," he said, given Qualcomm's "already established excellent relationships" with manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ming-Chi Kuo, a Taiwan market analyst at the financial-services firm TF International Securities, went a step further, saying in a post over the weekend that a takeover of Intel could be "disastrous" for Qualcomm. My industry survey also indicates that Qualcomm is currently in takeover talks with Intel. However, if this acquisition were to go through, it could prove disastrous for Qualcommhttps://t.co/fJ7EozISve His rationale was that Qualcomm's "most critical focus should be on establishing competitiveness in AI chips" for segments like smartphones and that he didn't see an acquisition of Intel helping. It could boost its position in the market for artificial-intelligence PCs, but the analyst said he thought Qualcomm already had a strong standing in that area, with its processors used in Microsoft's Windows on Arm platform — a version of Windows running on Arm technology that Microsoft is committed to. "While the acquisition of Intel could rapidly increase Qualcomm's PC market share, it comes at a significant cost," he wrote. "Qualcomm can grow in the AI PC market even without the acquisition." It's also unclear how Qualcomm would find the cash to buy Intel. The company's cash on hand is $13 billion, but even with its free cash flow, it still falls far short of Intel's price. And the impact on competition would likely spark alarm among regulators. A Qualcomm bid for Intel could face similar regulatory obstacles to Nvidia's takeover attempt for Arm in 2020, which it abandoned in 2022. Intel will, of course, want to consider its options. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that a new option was on the table after the investment giant Apollo offered to make a "multibillion-dollar investment" in the company. That could offer the chip firm vital capital for its new plans and help it stand on its own two feet. Jump to

Title: Is Amazon’s RTO Mandate A Signal For Other CEOs To End Remote Work?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2024/09/22/is-amazons-rto-mandate-a-signal-for-other-ceos-to-end-remote-work/

Many other companies are likely to follow a RTO mandate for two reasons. Slowly but surely, as the pandemic's unique circumstances fade, companies are backtracking on hybrid and remote work arrangements and rapidly restoring pre-pandemic business norms. Companies like Dell, Salesforce, and Bank of America have already established return-to-office (RTO) policies. Walmart recently joined the RTO mandate but is attempting to address concerns with a state-of-the-art, 350-acre campus designed to build community and make in-office work more appealing to employees accustomed to flexible arrangements. Amazon is the latest company to take a stricter stance on RTO. In a recent memo, CEO Andy Jassy announced that all employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. Jassy aims to strengthen Amazon's culture and teams, aspiring to operate like "the world's largest startup." Like others before it, Amazon's decision has sparked debate, drawing both detractors and proponents. Detractors argue that remote work leads to happier, more productive employees. Some even suggest that RTO policies are thinly veiled cost-cutting measures, allowing companies to avoid traditional layoffs. Dropbox, for example, has fully embraced virtual work, reinforcing that remote setups can thrive. On the other side, proponents of in-office work emphasize benefits like mentorship and addressing isolation issues. Nearly 4 in 10 parents say they go days without leaving their house when working from home, and 33% report feeling "very isolated," according to the Modern Family Index conducted by The Harris Poll for Bright Horizons. This debate over the ideal work environment is unlikely to end soon. However, RTO policies offer advantages in two critical areas for companies looking to strengthen their culture and teams. A KPMG survey reveals that 79% of CEOs expect their hybrid employees to return full-time to the office by 2027, an abrupt rise from just 34% earlier this year. Jassy and other CEOs like Starbucks' Brian Niccol believe teams should be together as much as possible, as shared in Bloomberg. Jassy's memo emphasized that being in the office makes it "easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another." Amazon wants to act like a startup—agile, fast, and efficient. Reducing barriers to these goals is the bet Amazon and other companies are making with these policy reversals. Moreover, RTO could mitigate some of the negative aspects of remote work, such as isolation and loneliness, along with blurred work-life boundaries. According to a Wall Street Journal report, remote employees sometimes feel heavily isolated and akin to feeling more like mercenaries than part of a cohesive unit. As organizations grow, they often become mired in red tape and bureaucratic inefficiencies. These inefficiencies can frustrate employees and slow down operations, affecting overall performance. Jassy's memo hints at these challenges: "Do we have the right org structure to drive the level of ownership and speed we desire?" The frustration with unnecessary meetings, excessive layers of approval, and prolonged deliberation is widespread. Jassy's note echoes this sentiment: "pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere." Unfortunately, communication can suffer when teams disperse, and the company grows. By returning to the office, Amazon aims to streamline communication, reduce management layers, and empower individual contributors. The goal is to see improvements in performance, collaboration, and overall culture. With Amazon's latest RTO policy, companies are signaling that they view flexible work arrangements as a benefit, not a given right. Management and organizations are reverting back to pre-COVID business norms, where leaders can interact face-to-face with their teams rather than through a monitor. While remote work and hybrid arrangements have advantages, only time will tell which approach best supports the organization and its people in the modern business world. One Community. Many Voices.
