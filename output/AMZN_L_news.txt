To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! I am sure you are waiting to learn the results of last week’s poll. (Reminder: Sign up for the Mobility newsletter to participate in our polls!) Here is what I asked: “What is the best business model for autonomous vehicle tech? (Keep profitability in mind.)” Far and away, readers think longer-haul delivery is the best bet, with 40% picking this option. Robotaxis came in next with 25.5% of the vote, followed by licensing tech to automakers at 19.1% and last-mile delivery with 14.9%. One reader emailed to point out that I didn’t include warehouse applications like autonomous forklifts. The longer-haul delivery category can be broken down further, though, and is worth another poll, which we included in this week’s newsletter. In the long list of arguments one might make to justify a $1 trillion compensation package, having control over a robot army was certainly not on my mind. And yet, this is the argument Elon Musk made during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call. Here’s the rundown: On November 6, shareholders will vote whether to approve a board-endorsed compensation package that would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla’s stock. If the company hits its target market value of $8.6 trillion, that package would be worth about $1 trillion. The board and Musk have spent weeks lobbying shareholders to approve the measure, even as proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject it. Musk is now in attack mode, which was on display at the end of the earnings call when he called the firms corporate terrorists and made his final pitch. His robot army argument centers on power and control, not so much money. Although, hey, money can provide both. “My biggest concern line: If we build this robot army, do I have a strong influence over that robot army? I don’t feel comfortable building a robot army if I don’t have a strong influence,” Musk said during the earnings call. He was referring to Tesla’s Optimus robot program and used it as an example of products he wants full control over. That argument will hardly persuade Musk’s critics, particularly in the wake of his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency. But Musk doesn’t need to convince his growing list of critics, unless, of course, they own Tesla shares. This week, General Motors dropped the ax on the BrightDrop electric van program after four short years. It was not the biggest surprise in the world; after all, hundreds of unsold vans have been sitting untouched in lots in Michigan and Canada for months now. (One little bird reached out to tell us that hundreds of them are in a lot in Flint, Michigan.) GM cited a slower-than-expected market for commercial electric vans, but it didn’t go into detail about why, exactly, BrightDrop failed so miserably. Another little bird has given us a clue, though. The vans are pricey but well-liked and should save fleet owners money over time. And electric drivetrains are a great fit for last-mile delivery. What GM appears to have missed was the infrastructure piece, according to one insider. The company leaned hard on outside partnerships to build out so-called depot charging, instead of offering it as part of the fleet purchases. That turned a number of potential customers away and just generally caused headaches. Got a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com. The big deal this week is about EVs and AI data centers. Yes, there is a connection. Redwood Materials raised $350 million in a Series E round led by venture firm Eclipse, and included a new strategic investment by Nvidia’s venture capital arm, NVentures. The company’s valuation was not disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch it was about $6 billion, a billion dollars higher than its previous valuation. The chunk of this money is going toward Redwood’s new energy storage business, which is giving a new purpose to EV batteries it has collected and that have too much life left to put through the recycling process. The company ties these retired EV batteries to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, or the grid, to power AI data centers or industrial sites. Other deals that got my attention this week … Avride secured strategic investments and other commitments of up to $375 million, backed by Uber and Nebius. None of these companies gave me specifics when asked if this was all equity. One insider did say to pay attention to the “other commitments” bit, which suggests it was not a straight cash injection. Spiro, the African electric motorbike startup headquartered in Dubai, raised $100 million in a round led by the Fund for Export Development in Africa (FEDA), the development arm of Afreximbank. This is the largest raise ever for African e-mobility. General Motors made several announcements at an event in NYC that were meant to show where it’s headed. And, yes, AI plays a central role. Before AI could take the stage, GM said it will overhaul the electrical and computational guts of its future vehicles. The company will roll out a new electric architecture and centralized computing platform in new vehicles, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028. That foundation will allow the company to deliver faster software; more capable automated driving features, including eyes-off driving; and a custom, conversational AI assistant. Earnings season is upon us, and this quarter I am watching for data and executive commentary that helps me understand how tariffs and the expired EV tax credit are affecting the automotive sector. I don’t have any clear takeaways yet — and probably won’t until the next quarter. Tariffs are hitting, Q3 reports from GM and Ford indicate. For instance, GM forecast that tariffs will reduce its 2025 profits by $2.3 billion and Ford said it would take a $2 billion bite out of the bottom line. But both of those projections are billions of dollars better than the automakers predicted earlier this year, and the automakers hope to offset those costs. CEOs from both automakers thanked President Trump for extending a relief measure from tariffs on automotive parts sourced from Canada and Mexico. Some other GM and Ford news: Ford will continue to pause production of its F-150 Lightning trucks as it prioritizes gas and hybrid F-Series versions in a bid to recover from a fire at its primary aluminum supplier Nevolis. Meanwhile, GM CEO Mary Barra told the Verge’s Decoder podcast that the company will drop support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto from all of its vehicles. Oh, and late-breaking: GM has laid off 200 salaried workers from its Warren Tech Center. Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, results buoyed by U.S. customers who took advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit. That didn’t translate to greater earnings. Tesla’s third-quarter profit was $1.4 billion, 37% lower than it was in the same quarter last year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation after seeing footage from early October of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus that was unloading kids in Atlanta. Rivian is undergoing a bit of a shake-up that includes cutting 600 people from its workforce (its third round of layoffs this year), and its founder and CEO is taking on yet another position: chief marketing officer. Rivian also agreed this week to pay $250 million to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company suddenly hiked prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022. Meanwhile, I spent some time in the Bay Area with executives from Rivian’s micromobility spinout company Also. The company revealed three new products, and if Also president Chris Yu and Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe (and Also board member) are to be believed, there will be even more coming. For now, it’s a slick modular pedal-assist e-bike and two pedal-assist quad vehicles — the delivery van version that Amazon has already agreed to buy.

The tech giants behind the AI boom have become too big to fail and are using their position to mount an assault on labor. Under the guise of technological inevitability, companies are using the AI boom to rewrite the social contract.

While official unemployment remains low, America’s labor market is stagnating: wage growth has slowed, job creation has weakened, and labor force participation is in decline. White-collar employment, particularly in tech, has fallen by 1.9 percent since its peak in 2022. This may sound modest, but previous recessions in 2008 and 2020 began with similar declines. In the tech industry, layoffs are up 36 percent from last year. What began in 2022 as start-up downsizing has since spread to larger, higher-profile companies such as Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and Meta. Mainstream explanations attribute these cuts to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI, a branch of machine learning that draws associations across massive data to generate images, text, or predictions without preset instruction, has been cast as a disruptive force capable of reshaping society. The CEO of Anthropic, one of the leading generative AI firms, says we need to stop “sugarcoating”: AI could “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20 percent in the next five years.” There are reasons to be skeptical of this alarmism. A recent Yale Budget Lab study finds that “while the anxiety over the effects of generative AI on today’s labor market are widespread, our data suggests it remains largely speculative.” Similarly, Nobel laureate economist Daron Acemoğlu sees no evidence that the new technology will have “revolutionary effects” on the economy. Countering claims that AI will double US GDP growth, he estimates a modest gain of barely 1.5 percent over the next decade, with minimal impact on productivity. Other economists have found that even in settings where AI has been deployed, the economic impact has been minimal. If this is true, then what explains the layoffs? The second most common story shifts the focus from Silicon Valley to Washington. In the wake of the Great Recession, central banks set interest rates extremely low, initiating what came to be known as the zero-interest rate period, or ZIRP. This era lasted through 2021. Between 2008 and 2021, cheap credit allowed firms to borrow, expand, and fund higher-risk investment. When rates started to rise in 2022, overleveraged firms faced higher debt-servicing costs and were forced to cut spending. There is some truth to this narrative. Oracle, for instance, entered the AI race late and now faces $95 billion in long-term debt. It would need to increase its annual revenue to more than $300 billion by 2030 to justify its investments. Amid mounting pressure to meet financial targets, the company laid off 3,000 workers in September. Yet while some debt-financed firms like Oracle struggle, they are not representative of the sector as a whole. At best they explain only part of the story. According to Goldman Sachs, AI-related companies issued $141 billion in new corporate debt in 2025, and Bloomberg reports that US tech companies raised another $157 billion in bond markets as of late September, up 70 percent from last year. These are impressive figures, but still only a small fraction of the roughly $1.5 trillion in total projected AI spending this year. Most AI expenditures are not by debt-ridden start-ups, but cash-rich incumbents such as Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. These firms have low leverage, deep reserves, and easy access to cheap, high-grade credit. For example, founder of Good AI Capital Darwin Ling writes that Meta, which has already invested $14.3 billion in AI infrastructure and hiring, recently announced it would build two new data centers, which will deliver six gigawatts (GW) of power in total to run large-scale models. For perspective, one GW is equivalent to the energy of consumption of a small US state. To fund this, Meta will combine $26 billion in debt and $3 billion in equity, the largest private equity transaction in history. This debt will not appear directly on Meta’s books, but rather through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), while Meta will lease back the infrastructure. This is intended to serve as a financial roadmap for other companies looking to invest in massive infrastructure projects for hyperscalers. This reflects the broader circular financing logic core to the AI economy in which firms are simultaneously investors, clients, and creditors. The same small set of companies fund, supply, and sell to one another in an increasingly closed loop of mutually dependent monopolies. For example, Oracle, Nvidia, CoreWeave, and SoftBank trade $1 trillion worth of AI deals among themselves. Returns derive not from productivity gains but from a form of enclosure of access rights, or owning the platforms, data, and infrastructures on which others depend. As such, the system is structured so that those investing are increasingly self-reinforcing and too big to fail. Or as the Economist explains plainly, “For a start, a lot of today’s spending could prove worthless. [But] the good news is that today’s financial system could probably absorb the blow.” The reason for this is that those providing credit are private-market funds funded by rich individuals and institutions rather than depositors, and AI start-ups are financed by well-capitalized ventures and sovereign-wealth funds that can withstand loss. In spite of its strong financial position, Meta announced it would lay off 5 percent of its employees this week to trim “nonessential teams” and focus on “advancing AI.” The firings, like many other tech layoffs, are not driven by financial strain or genuine automation-related pressure but by a strategic choice to restructure contracts and weaken the position of labor. Meta can make these cuts because of its outsize economic and political power, which insulates it from market and social discipline and allows it to impose a new regime of accumulation on its workforce. Under the guise of technological inevitability, companies are using the AI boom to rewrite the social contract — laying off employees, rehiring them at lower wages, intensifying workloads, and normalizing precarity. In short, these are political choices masquerading as technical necessities, AI is not the cause of the layoffs but their justification. The growing share of white-collar workers rendered precarious or redundant by capital’s technological drive form a new surplus population or a pool of disposable and downwardly mobile workers used to depress wages and normalize insecurity. They are not external to capitalism but internal to its reproduction. The commonly voiced injunction that workers ought to “reskill” or be left behind provides a moral and ideological justification for attacks on labor. But the effects of AI-driven reorganization will also be felt by the majority of workers who will not lose their jobs thanks to the new technology. This is because managerial reorganization under the guise of technological improvement puts pressure on workers to accomplish tasks in less time, take on new tasks, or absorb the tasks of those fired, all for the same pay. In response to this push to extract more value from workers, unions must be willing to challenge these forms of reorganization. This means organizing around compensation, job security, data rights, and working conditions. Struggles of this kind are already taking place, led by unions looking to collectively bargain for workers affected by AI adoption. Yet labor alone cannot win this struggle. The enclosure of the AI economy is sustained not only by private monopolies but by the state itself, which supports these companies through subsidies, permissive regulation, and political capture. Countering Big Tech will require a political project to reclaim democratic control over the use to which the products of human intelligence are being put. In Karl Marx’s words, “Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks.” Sophie Bandarkar is a graduate student in economics with a focus in housing and finance. {{ message }} Thanks for signing up! → Already on our list?

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes Time to dust off your apes everyone, because Otherside, the Bored Ape Yacht Club metaverse from Yuga Labs, is finally about to be released! This string of words probably didn’t find much purchase in your brain, because if you’re not part of the Web3 world, the last time you were cognizant of Bored Ape-related news was likely October of 2022. That was around the time Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs had seemingly become toxic assets, and the Biden Administration was targeting parent company Yuga Labs with a probe into whether or not the Apes were unregistered securities. In any case, that’s the popularity timeline a search for “bored apes” on Google Trends suggestsâa spike in early 2022, a jagged drop-off, and a seemingly asymptotic decline to almost zero. And that’s where things sit today. Last year Mashable explored what was left of the Bored Ape empire, finding ape-themed burger joint closures, recent layoffs, and general bad vibes. The freshest indignity for the apes was just last week, when the Amazon Web Services crash reportedly disconnected all the Bored Ape Yacht Club images from marketplaces like OpenSea. But that’s all in the past now. Otherside is meant to be an NFT-based interactive world, and Yuga Labs originally teased it in 2022, before the NFT crash. Suddenly it has an actual launch date of November 12. Figge reveals that the Koda Nexus will go live on November 12th pic.twitter.com/YkfbZfJIII — Jack (@Jack55750) October 25, 2025 It all gets a bit “slurp juice” from here. Otherside is also known as the “Koda Nexus,” because, according to the decentralized app marketplace DappRadar, “Kodas” will be the term for NFT-based characters or “celestial beings” that inhabit this new online space, and “the narrative surrounding Kodas is directly connected to the Otherside lore and its first in-metaverse game: The Legends of the Mara.” Also, not all Kodas are Bored Apes. Got all that? Jay Peters of The Verge was able to try Otherside, and gave his impression. According to Peters, it’s like Meta’s Horizon Worlds, a video game-type environment where you can wander around, hang out, and talk to other usersâand where not much else happens. At launch, it sounds like it is trying to be something more like Fortnite mixed with Robloxâa customizable, open-ended gaming space. The most promising feature in Peters’ account of Otherside was the flexibility to at least let non-crypto people in the front door. You can apparently play it from a web browser after registering with just an email address. In his announcement address Yuga Labs’ chief product officer Michael Figge called Otherside “a living world, with scale, story, and real utility.” After three years of hearing grandiose pronouncements like that, and having most of them turn out to be disappointing AI chatbots, doesn’t an open world video game sound like a nice change of pace?

Title: Netflix Shuts Down Squid Game Mobile Studio After Calling It a Hit

Netflix has shut down Boss Fight Entertainment, the Texas-based studio behind Squid Game: Unleashed, according to posts from staff on LinkedIn. The move comes just three years after Netflix acquired the team in 2022 to boost its push into mobile gaming. Boss Fight’s co-founder and former CEO David Rippy, now a studio director at Netflix, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post, writing: “Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game: Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries.” He also urged studios to consider hiring affected employees, calling them “outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through.” “After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down. I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we’ve released. I wish you could see what we had cooking!”, said another director, David Luehmann, also on LinkedIn. When Netflix acquired Boss Fight in 2022, the company said the studio’s experience in “building hit games across genres” would help it grow its gaming lineup. Just this week, co-CEO Greg Peters highlighted Squid Game: Unleashed during Netflix’s earnings call as an example of how it wants to expand into games tied to its own franchises. But despite that praise, the studio is now gone. Netflix declined to comment on the closure, as reported by The Verge. The shutdown adds to a growing list of industry layoffs and studio closures this year, including at Dune: Awakening developer Funcom and BioShock maker Cloud Chamber. Netflix itself previously closed another internal AAA studio before releasing any games. Netflix says its next focus is on party-style games playable on TVs using smartphones as controllers (just look at the recent reboot of Amazon Luna)—a far smaller, more casual approach compared to the ambitious projects it once teased. Mobile games for iOS and Android are free to download for anyone with a Netflix subscription. I don’t know anyone that actually downloads these games–do you?

Title: A laid-off Microsoft manager shares why he's ready to say goodbye to Big Tech after 2 decades

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After three stints at Microsoft spanning more than two decades, Joe Friend was laid off in May. He's still figuring out what's next, but there's one thing he's sure of: His time in Big Tech is over. About six months earlier, Friend, a director of product management overseeing a team of nine, started hearing rumors of company restructuring that could affect managers. However, he didn't believe his specific role was in jeopardy. But he was wrong. In May, he learned that he and 14 other members of his working group — including four other managers — had been laid off. "I wasn't entirely surprised by the layoffs. I was surprised to get caught up in them," said the 62-year-old, who lives in Washington state. Friend said the layoff was "doubly shocking" because it upended his retirement strategy. He had planned to stay at Microsoft until at least his 65th birthday — a milestone that, under company policy, allows most stock grants to continue vesting even after the employee leaves. Once he turned 65, he planned to either retire or pivot to something new. Now, that timeline was out the window. "My plan was to figure out what I wanted to do over the next three years," he said. "Then all of a sudden I'm at the doorstep, and I have to make that decision now." Friend is among the thousands of Microsoft workers who've been laid off over the past year. After cutting about 6,000 jobs in May, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 more in July. A company spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Google, Intel, and Amazon have also announced plans to reduce the number of managers — part of a broader trend dubbed the "Great Flattening." While overall layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a slowdown in white-collar hiring has made it harder for many to land new roles. In this challenging environment, Friend shared what he's hoping to find in the next chapter of his career. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Transitioning away from Microsoft was something Friend had done twice, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend first joined Microsoft in 1994 as a lead program manager, working on Microsoft Word. In 1997, he and his family moved to Indonesia, where he spent more than six years working for an international NGO — a move driven by his long-held desire to live abroad and do work he found meaningful. In 2003, when Friend returned to the States, he initially considered staying in the nonprofit world but found it less economically viable in the US. So he reentered the tech industry and found himself back at Microsoft. Friend spent the next 14 years at the company, but by early 2017, he was feeling burned out and decided to move on. He said he interviewed at a few large firms but soon concluded that none of them were the right fit. "I finally realized that I didn't want to work at another big company," he said. He accepted a role at the developer site Stack Overflow, a move he said provided the change of pace he was looking for. But Microsoft came calling once again. Someone Friend knew at Microsoft kept nudging him to join their team. Initially resistant, he eventually agreed to hear them out — and saw the recent internal restructuring in his former business area as a positive sign. "I was really impressed with what I saw as significant cultural change at the company and agreed to go back," he said. Friend returned to Microsoft in 2018 and remained until May 2025, when he learned he'd been laid off. After being laid off, Friend continued receiving paychecks until mid-July, when he received a "very comfortable" lump-sum severance payment that amounted to close to what he would have made if he had been employed the rest of this year. He said he was fortunate to be in a strong financial position, which gave him time to figure out his next steps. "It feels like a betrayal, and it impacts me financially, but it's not going to hurt," he said of the layoff. Rather than rushing into his next move, Friend met with a financial advisor to see whether an earlier retirement might be feasible. He began exploring job leads that came his way, but nothing stuck. Friend now considers himself to be "semi-retired." He said that in recent months, he's focused on helping a young entrepreneur build a small business. "It's not about making money," he said. "It's about supporting somebody who wants to transform their life." If Friend were to retire fully, he believes he and his wife can make it work financially without major lifestyle changes, but he's not sure he's ready to leave the workforce yet. What he is sure of is that his next job won't be with Microsoft. He said he believes the company once had an implicit "deal" with employees: If you performed well, you'd be rewarded financially and enjoy job stability. He said he no longer thinks that's true. Friend said some of his concerns apply to the tech industry more broadly, which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role. "I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about," he said. "It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech."

Title: Trump’s Faltering Economy

The Consumer Price Index for September increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, the Labor Department reported this morning. This was an increase from 2.9 percent in August, 2.7 percent in July, and around 2.3 percent this past spring, before Trump’s perverse policies began to bite. Inflation of 3 percent doesn’t seem too bad, but it conceals a great deal of softness in the economy. That weakness will be sufficiently worrisome for the Fed to likely proceed with its planned quarter-point rate cut when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week. But after that, both inflation and unemployment are likely to worsen, leaving the Fed with no good options. More from Robert Kuttner On the inflation front, Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs have yet to fully bite, but their impact is likely to increase over time. Other specific price hikes, as in health insurance under the ACA, will begin to hit only in November, although health insurance costs generally are already more than 6 percent over last year’s. In addition, Trump’s killing of antitrust enforcement and other consumer protections is allowing a lot of opportunistic price increases that reflect abuses of market power. Employment is also weakening. With the Bureau of Labor Statistics staff mostly on furlough because of the government shutdown, precise numbers on joblessness are not available. But myriad indicators of a soft job market are unmistakable. Trump’s rescissions of federal spending and layoffs of federal employees raise the unemployment rate directly, and have cascaded throughout the economy. As Paul Krugman has observed, every job indicator is soft and getting softer. New hires are barely above the rate of the Great Recession. The rate of long-term unemployment—more than six months without a job—soared in August, and updated numbers are likely to be worse but not available because of the government shutdown. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Jobless rates were higher in August than a year earlier in 243 of the 387 metropolitan areas. More and more corporations are announcing or planning layoffs, including Microsoft, Meta, Intel, Target, and Kohl’s. Amazon plans to replace 600,000 warehouse workers with robots. One of the most alarming indicators of a risky economy is the heavy reliance on spending by the wealthiest consumers. In a recent speech, Fed governor Christopher Waller, one of Trump’s own appointees no less, pointed out that consumption is heavily skewed to rich people because of the gross inequality in the economy and the stock boom, which many economists think is a bubble. Waller said, “The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent of personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total. Their share of stock market wealth is even more skewed.” In fact, the top 10 percent of households own 87 percent of stocks, while the bottom half own hardly any. Moreover, a great deal of capital investment and the stock market boom are driven by artificial intelligence. “Artificial” is the right word. At some point, that bubble is likely to burst, and luxury spending with it. All told, the seemingly not-too-bad Trump economy is living on borrowed time. You might wonder how the BLS was able to release this report despite the government shutdown. The answer is that the September data were collected before the shutdown began. Even so, the release date had to be postponed from October 15 to October 24, while the BLS got a special exemption to bring back a skeleton crew of economists and IT specialists to get the report out, but only to work on inflation and not on employment. This was done because the Social Security cost-of-living increase for next year relies on third-quarter data. Next month’s CPI report, based on data that the BLS is supposed to be collecting right now, will likely be inadequate, and even more sketchy the longer the shutdown drags on. But other sources in the public domain are likely to show worsening trends in both prices and jobs. Trump inherited a strong economy. Tearing down the house is the right Trump visual.

Ashley Lutz is an executive editor at Fortune, overseeing the Success, Well, syndication, and social teams. She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. Target recently highlighted its ongoing partnership with a group dedicated to Black founders, following a turbulent year marked by backlash, boycotts, and leadership changes. The retailer’s renewed spotlight on Black businesses could signal a recalibration—and perhaps an effort to mend relations with communities that once helped define its brand ethos. In an Oct. 20 statement, Target pointed to its tie-up with the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs (RICE), which supports Black small business founders with education, mentorship, and access to retail opportunities. Through RICE’s Retail Readiness Academy, Target has helped fund initiatives that train emerging entrepreneurs in retail strategy and business scaling. The company also extended support through HBCU programs under its “HBCU, Always” series—an ongoing effort to connect graduates with Target’s mentorship network.​ The timing is significant, notes journalist Habiba Katsha in a blog post for People of Color in Tech. The announcement arrives just months after the resignation of CEO Brian Cornell, amid falling sales and customer traffic. Cornell’s leadership had been central to Target’s post-2020 DEI expansion, including its $2 billion Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiative. Yet in January 2025, the company abruptly moved to end many of those DEI goals, citing a “realignment” of strategy and a focus on “business neutrality”.​ Target’s rollback of DEI initiatives set off a firestorm. As Fortune reported in early 2025, civil rights activists organized a nationwide boycott in protest of the company’s decision to scale back its DEI infrastructure, which had been celebrated in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. ​ The boycott came during Black History Month—symbolically amplifying the controversy—and led to dramatic declines in store traffic. Black business owners whose products were featured in Target stores voiced concern that the boycotts might inadvertently harm their own sales, prompting activists to urge consumers to buy directly from those brands online instead. ​Target sales have declined in 2025, and the stock has dropped 61% from its 2021 peak. The company also announced its first major layoffs in a decade and plans to cut 1,800 corporate jobs. While consumer boycotts have played a role, company leadership has also cited competition from Amazon and Walmart as factors in its decline. Target’s retreat mirrors a larger pattern across corporate America. Fortune has chronicled the growing pressure on companies to either scale back or quietly rebrand DEI programs amid shifting political and cultural winds. By mid-2025, only a small fraction of Fortune 500 firms continued to publish detailed diversity reports, as others transitioned to euphemistic “inclusion” or “corporate responsibility” frameworks.​ Earlier this year, analysts warned that companies dismantling DEI structures risk severe reputation damage and long-term brand erosion. “If the politics in society change, your values should not,” said consultant Ponce de Leon, underscoring the trust deficit companies face when perceived as abandoning equity commitments.​ Other Fortune coverage emphasized the financial risks of retreating from DEI. Boycotts, talent attrition, and eroding customer loyalty—particularly among younger and more diverse demographics—are emerging as critical market liabilities.​ Target’s decision to spotlight RICE and reaffirm support for Black-owned business development is being read as both a reputational hedge and a cultural reset. It offers the company a way to demonstrate continued engagement with racial equity without reviving the formal DEI frameworks that drew political scrutiny. Whether this recalibration can reverse Target’s declining sales remains uncertain. But in a corporate landscape where DEI language is declining 68% in filings from S&P 500 companies in 2025, Target’s move stands out as a strategic attempt to balance commerce, conscience, and survival in a politically polarized marketplace. ​For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Lisa Leff, Associated Press Lisa Leff, Associated Press Leave your feedback Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer’s customer base. About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target’s corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said. WATCH: Pastor leading Target boycott on its impact and the retailer’s response Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target’s next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week. “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname “Tarzhay.” READ MORE: After Target backs away from diversity programs, civil rights activists call for a boycott Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target’s next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company’s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology. He cited the same goals in his message to employees, calling the layoffs a “necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,” he wrote. READ MORE: U.S. inflation stays elevated but prices rose less than feared last month Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales — those from established physical stores and online channels — in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%. The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target’s sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said. The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Microsoft’s executive-mandated 30% profit target reportedly drove Xbox layoffs, studio shutdowns, and canceled projects

Microsoft’s Xbox gaming division has reported been under intense pressure to deliver 30% profit margins, nearly double the video game industry’s 2024 average of 17%, a target set by executives in the fall of 2023. This extremely lofty target has directly contributed to widespread layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations across the sector. According to a Bloomberg investigation reported on October 23, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood introduced these “accountability margins,” Microsoft’s internal term for profit goals, as part of a broader corporate push to squeeze more efficiency from the gaming arm. This benchmark, which S&P Global Analyst Neil Barbour described as “usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it,” is in direct contrast to the division’s historical performance. Leaked FTC documents from 2023 revealed that Xbox achieved only 12% profit margins in the first nine months of fiscal year 2022, with averages hovering between 10% and 20% over the prior six years. The fallout from the aggressive target has been quite severe, resulting in over 10,000 job cuts in Microsoft’s operations in early 2023. This was further exacerbated by Microsoft's announcement of 1,900 layoffs within its gaming division in January 2024. During May 2024, Microsoft also closed down Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Games. Later in September 2024, the gaming division was met with another 650 layoffs. In July 2025, Microsoft announced it would cut 9,000 jobs within its gaming division. These measures also resulted in the cancellation of many high-profile projects, such as the Perfect Dark reboot, Rare’s Everwild, ZeniMax Online’s Project Blackbird, and Avalanche Studios’ Contraband. In response to the report, an Xbox spokesperson stated that “success doesn’t look the same across every project or priority,” pretty much acknowledging the variable nature of gaming projects but offering little on the margin mandate. Critics, including former Xbox executives, have pointed to Game Pass’s “weird inner tensions,” where subscriber growth often comes at the direct expense of retail revenue, exacerbating the profit squeeze. To meet revenue goals, Microsoft bumped up the price of Game Pass Ultimate in recent months, though this move has drawn widespread backlash from subscribers, resulting in mass cancellations.

Title: How High Will David Ellison Go in Paramount’s Bid to Bag Warner Bros. Discovery?

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Warner Bros. Discovery is smack in the eye of the latest media M&A maelstrom — and staffers are bracing for the possibility that they’ll get a new corporate overlord in the near future. The leading takeover candidate is aspiring Hollywood empire-builder David Ellison, son of one of the world’s wealthiest people. Ellison, fresh off orchestrating Skydance’s merger with Paramount, is now aggressively chasing a much bigger quarry in Warner Bros. Discovery. Related Stories Box Office: 'Black Phone 2' Grabs $10.7 Million Opening Day, 'Good Fortune' Fizzling in Third Place China Box Office: ‘Row to Win’ Rises to No. 1 as 'Tron: Ares’ and ‘One Battle After Another’ Open This week, WBD chief David Zaslav and the company’s board publicly announced that they’re doing due diligence on in-bound acquisition interest from “multiple parties.” The company didn’t name Paramount or any others that have made M&A overtures. But Ellison has been driving especially hard to win over WBD and Zaslav with a series of escalating offers backed in part by his dad, Larry Ellison (net worth: more than $330 billion). Popular on Variety In three letters to the WBD board, Ellison proffered bids of $19, $22 and $23.50 per share, the last coming Oct. 13, a source with knowledge of the matter says, confirming a New York Times report. That last offer would value WBD at more than $58 billion; separately, the company carries net debt of nearly $36 billion. (Warner Bros. Discovery shares closed at $21.25 a share on Oct. 23, up 69% since news of Ellison’s interest broke last month.) Ellison, looking to do some ego-massaging, even gave Zaslav the opportunity to become co-chief executive and co-chairman of a merged Paramount-WBD in his most recent missive. Each bid was rejected by WBD’s board. (Company reps declined to comment.) What Happens if Paramount Acquires Warner Bros. Discovery? HBO Max-Paramount+ Combination, Huge Layoffs and More Obviously, the Ellisons and their investment partners have a ceiling: They’re not going to go after Warner Bros. Discovery at any price. Their latest $23.50/share proposal is not a best and final offer. Now that WBD’s board has kicked off an M&A review process and is opening its books, the Paramount camp will have an opportunity to come back with a higher (or modified) bid. But it’s understood that Ellison believes he has the pole position among would-be buyers of WBD and is unlikely to go much higher on deal price. Zaslav, of course, is eager to pit rival suitors against each other to get a maximum dollar figure for WBD, either as a whole or in pieces. “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” he said in the company’s statement Tuesday. Netflix, Amazon and Apple are said to be in the mix as prospective buyers, but likely only for WBD’s studios and streaming businesses. That aligns with Warner Bros. Discovery’s already-underway plan to split into two companies by mid-2026: Warner Bros., housing HBO Max and the studios, and Discovery Global, largely comprising the TV networks. But one senior industry exec tells Variety that for the tech-oriented companies, WBD as a whole — inclusive of TV networks — “is just not core” to their growth strategies. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on its Q3 earnings call that the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” pouring cold water on the prospect of a deal for WBD in its entirety. While Sarandos left the door open by saying Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets, he added: “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.” In its announcement, WBD said it would consider a sale of the separated Warner Bros. entity to a third party, alongside a spinoff of Discovery Global to shareholders. Meanwhile, there’s been speculation that Sony might make a play for WBD, but sources tell Variety the company is not interested. Comcast is circling Warner Bros., but it is also unloading most of its cable TV assets into spinoff company Versant, potentially complicating any talks to buy WBD. Plus, analysts say, Trump’s enmity toward CEO Brian Roberts gives the Ellisons — who are palsy with the president — a better shot at getting a deal cleared. Trump, upset about MSNBC’s coverage of him, once called Roberts the “chairman of ‘Concast’” and a “lowlife.” “Given past commentary against all-things-Comcast from both the White House and the FCC over the past year, a successful Comcast acquisition of almost anything seems nearly unthinkable,” MoffettNathanson principal analyst Craig Moffett said in an Oct. 21 note to clients. What’s behind Ellison’s desire to marry Paramount with Warner Bros. Discovery? It’s the same trends that have whipped across the media biz for the past several years, says Scott Purdy, media strategy leader for professional services firm KPMG U.S. Big media companies have seen a decline in their linear TV business, and “industries in decline tend to consolidate,” Purdy says. “The one major factor is scale.” In addition, he says, buyers often want to snap up high-value entertainment franchises and intellectual property — partly to keep them out of the hands of competitors. A Paramount-WBD megamerger would entail a massive tranche of layoffs, letting the new entity consolidate functions across corporate divisions, studios, TV and streaming. In the meantime, Ellison and his team are expected to begin mass layoffs at Paramount Skydance next week, eliminating around 2,000 jobs in the U.S., with additional cuts internationally. Ellison, speaking earlier this month at L.A.’s Bloomberg Screentime conference, would not confirm that Paramount Skydance has made a bid for WBD. But he explained why he thinks Paramount needs to bolt on more content-producing engines to achieve sustainable growth in a streaming-centric world. He even cited Zaslav’s comments from a year ago that the industry needs more consolidation. “I do think there’s a lot of [M&A] options out there in terms of what actually might be actionable in the near future,” Ellison said. “You actually need more content to yield more engagement.” Now that Warner Bros. Discovery has commenced a formal M&A review process, the question is whether Ellison will come back with an even higher offer — and whether the WBD board believes it’s really the best path forward.

Title: Frustrated by AI? How to Turn the Hype Into Real Results for Your Business

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. In some ways, Gartner's annual IT conference was a departure from previous years. There was a lot more discussion of disappointing returns on AI investments thus far, alongside suggestions for how enterprises should plan for AI playing a more important role over the next few years. Gartner analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer acknowledged that it's easy to dismiss the impact of AI since most firms have yet to see the transformative impact. However, they cautioned against falling for the hype and instead backed a "golden path" whereby value can be found in between those two extremes. In 2025, Gartner put the odds of an AI initiative achieving a return on investment at one in five, Mullery said. The odds of an AI initiative achieving true transformation was just one in 50. Plummer noted that a recent study of chief financial officers showed that 74% say they are seeing productivity gains, but only 11% are seeing return on investment. To counter this, Mullery and Plummer proposed a new "positioning system" looking at both the readiness of AI systems and the readiness of humans to take advantage of that. When neither is ready, Plummer said, you should be highly skeptical of AI. When both are ready, "we flip a switch into AI optimism." Right now, he said, AI systems are almost halfway up the scale, but humans are only a quarter of the way. This makes value hard to achieve. Mullery noted that most AI systems currently have questionable readiness; for instance, generative AI systems have an error rate of up to 25% depending on the use case. That may be good enough for some applications, but not all. Worse, she said, Gartner surveys suggest that 84% of CIOs and IT leaders say they don't have a formal process to check accuracy, beyond having a "human in the loop." "AI can make mistakes faster than we humans can catch them," she said, calling on IT leaders to create their own "accuracy survival kit" with things such as formal metrics, a two-factor error checking, and a "good enough ratio." This is "harder to achieve than you think," she argued. Plummer noted that AI agents "are at the top of the hype cycle" now, with 17% of organizations saying they have adopted agents already and another 42% expecting to adopt them in the next 12 months. "But not all agents are created equal," he said, noting that 88% of the IT leaders are focused on conversational agents, not ones involved in decision making. For that, he said, we'll need multi-agent systems, with reasoning and autonomous decision making that can actually perform the "jobs to be done" such as one that could create the slides for a presentation by just listening to him talking. This kind of agent won't be cheap. Mullery noted that the big problem is that even if you think you know the costs of running AI on day one of the project, you don't know what it will cost on day 100, unlike most IT projects. In fact, 74% of organizations are breaking even or even losing money on their AI investments. That's partly because they don't recognize the ancillary costs, such as managing access credentials, acquiring new data sets, or accuracy tools, as well as time spent on training and change management, Plummer explained. Then there is the issue of picking the right AI vendor. Plummer noted that large AI vendors are acting like "Digital Nation States," spending more on AI infrastructure per quarter than the annual GDP of 47% of the world's countries. Mullery suggested that if you're planning a massive rollout of AI to your enterprise, you should bet on a major hyperscaler such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, or Oracle. But if you want industry-specific use cases, you'll need to partner with startups. And for leading edge capabilities, you should look to "wild card" vendors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral AI. Within this is also the question of "AI sovereignty"—not just the data, but also the models, results, and users. Plummer said the US, China, and the European Union are building sovereign AI solutions with proprietary models that they control and predicted that 35% of countries will be locked into region-specific AI platforms using proprietary contextual data by 2027. He warned that if you're a global enterprise, you might get locked out of a long-term partner relationship, so he suggested big companies look into digital tokenization solutions that anonymize data, so the real data doesn't leave your shore. When it comes to human readiness, Mullery noted that 71% of CIOs and IT leaders say their workforce is not ready for AI "because AI unleashes a toxic mix of steep learning curve and the primal fear that AI is going to replace us." But despite the scare headlines, while 60% of CFOs are expecting they can reduce head count due to AI, in reality only about 1% of job loss is due to AI today. "It's not about job loss. It's about job chaos," Plummer said, noting that job and role restructuring is having 20 times more impact than layoffs. Instead, he said, Gartner is seeing hiring restraint for junior level jobs. So instead of looking for a "talent remix," Mullery urged executives to think about a "value remix" —doing things such as cutting the backlog and increasing roles that require human empathy. While there may be some layoffs, demographic shifts and labor force stagnation will balance it out. "By 2027, AI will create more jobs than it destroys. But the sad fact is, there won't be enough new people to hire," she said. So, the best thing you can do is train your workers to use AI well, with one intent being creating "Swiss army knife" workers who can pick the tools to solve any given task. For that, she said, you need AI literacy and experiential knowledge. They both discussed how it was important to be on the lookout for behavioral changes driven by AI. Perhaps no department is as likely to see disruption as IT itself. "In 2030, your IT organization will look completely different," Mullery said. According to a Gartner study of CIOs, 81% of IT work is done by humans without AI. By 2030, CIOs expect 75% of IT work will be done by humans augmented with AI, and 25% will be done by AI alone. Zero percent of IT work will be done without AI. This will change your entire IT estate, she said, and create extra capacity, so it's up to leaders to demonstrate extra IT value. One issue Plummer identified was using this extra capability to make up for worker shortages caused by the demographic changes. Other changes will impact the business more directly, creating what Plummer called "shock waves." For instance, he said, as AI takes over more diagnosis and virtual care allows more recovery at home, hospitals will become primarily treatment centers. Today, we are gradually adding machine autonomy around the edges of our organizations, Mullery said, moving us towards autonomous business. This is the new "agentic battleground" where multiple vendors compete to deliver teams of machine workers ready at a moment's notice. But Plummer insisted that "If we keep fighting to protect our roles of the past, we'll never reimagine our roles for the future." He said the day may come when we collectively decide we will choose not to do things like managing operations or configuring system and instead choose to have people primary nurture human connectedness. "We decide what humans will do and what AI will," he said. He even showed a digital twin of himself – AI Daryl – that could present ideas the way he would when he's not available. Such technology might uncover value hidden in the data you already have and prevent the "retirement brain drain" by training such systems on the documentation, code reviews, and meeting records of retiring employees. "When humans and AI are ready, we can transcend and ride the AI shockwaves," Mullery concluded. "Let's bring it all together and retrace our path to find, capture, and sustain value. You have to get both Ai and humans ready." Michael J. Miller is chief information officer at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

In some ways, Gartner's annual IT conference was a departure from previous years. There was a lot more discussion of disappointing returns on AI investments thus far, alongside suggestions for how enterprises should plan for AI playing a more important role over the next few years. Gartner analysts Alicia Mullery and Daryl Plummer acknowledged that it's easy to dismiss the impact of AI since most firms have yet to see the transformative impact. However, they cautioned against falling for the hype and instead backed a "golden path" whereby value can be found in between those two extremes. In 2025, Gartner put the odds of an AI initiative achieving a return on investment at one in five, Mullery said. The odds of an AI initiative achieving true transformation was just one in 50. Plummer noted that a recent study of chief financial officers showed that 74% say they are seeing productivity gains, but only 11% are seeing return on investment. To counter this, Mullery and Plummer proposed a new "positioning system" looking at both the readiness of AI systems and the readiness of humans to take advantage of that. When neither is ready, Plummer said, you should be highly skeptical of AI. When both are ready, "we flip a switch into AI optimism." Right now, he said, AI systems are almost halfway up the scale, but humans are only a quarter of the way. This makes value hard to achieve. Mullery noted that most AI systems currently have questionable readiness; for instance, generative AI systems have an error rate of up to 25% depending on the use case. That may be good enough for some applications, but not all. Worse, she said, Gartner surveys suggest that 84% of CIOs and IT leaders say they don't have a formal process to check accuracy, beyond having a "human in the loop." "AI can make mistakes faster than we humans can catch them," she said, calling on IT leaders to create their own "accuracy survival kit" with things such as formal metrics, a two-factor error checking, and a "good enough ratio." This is "harder to achieve than you think," she argued. Plummer noted that AI agents "are at the top of the hype cycle" now, with 17% of organizations saying they have adopted agents already and another 42% expecting to adopt them in the next 12 months. "But not all agents are created equal," he said, noting that 88% of the IT leaders are focused on conversational agents, not ones involved in decision making. For that, he said, we'll need multi-agent systems, with reasoning and autonomous decision making that can actually perform the "jobs to be done" such as one that could create the slides for a presentation by just listening to him talking. This kind of agent won't be cheap. Mullery noted that the big problem is that even if you think you know the costs of running AI on day one of the project, you don't know what it will cost on day 100, unlike most IT projects. In fact, 74% of organizations are breaking even or even losing money on their AI investments. That's partly because they don't recognize the ancillary costs, such as managing access credentials, acquiring new data sets, or accuracy tools, as well as time spent on training and change management, Plummer explained. Then there is the issue of picking the right AI vendor. Plummer noted that large AI vendors are acting like "Digital Nation States," spending more on AI infrastructure per quarter than the annual GDP of 47% of the world's countries. Mullery suggested that if you're planning a massive rollout of AI to your enterprise, you should bet on a major hyperscaler such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, or Oracle. But if you want industry-specific use cases, you'll need to partner with startups. And for leading edge capabilities, you should look to "wild card" vendors such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral AI. Within this is also the question of "AI sovereignty"—not just the data, but also the models, results, and users. Plummer said the US, China, and the European Union are building sovereign AI solutions with proprietary models that they control and predicted that 35% of countries will be locked into region-specific AI platforms using proprietary contextual data by 2027. He warned that if you're a global enterprise, you might get locked out of a long-term partner relationship, so he suggested big companies look into digital tokenization solutions that anonymize data, so the real data doesn't leave your shore. When it comes to human readiness, Mullery noted that 71% of CIOs and IT leaders say their workforce is not ready for AI "because AI unleashes a toxic mix of steep learning curve and the primal fear that AI is going to replace us." But despite the scare headlines, while 60% of CFOs are expecting they can reduce head count due to AI, in reality only about 1% of job loss is due to AI today. "It's not about job loss. It's about job chaos," Plummer said, noting that job and role restructuring is having 20 times more impact than layoffs. Instead, he said, Gartner is seeing hiring restraint for junior level jobs. So instead of looking for a "talent remix," Mullery urged executives to think about a "value remix" —doing things such as cutting the backlog and increasing roles that require human empathy. While there may be some layoffs, demographic shifts and labor force stagnation will balance it out. "By 2027, AI will create more jobs than it destroys. But the sad fact is, there won't be enough new people to hire," she said. So, the best thing you can do is train your workers to use AI well, with one intent being creating "Swiss army knife" workers who can pick the tools to solve any given task. For that, she said, you need AI literacy and experiential knowledge. They both discussed how it was important to be on the lookout for behavioral changes driven by AI. Perhaps no department is as likely to see disruption as IT itself. "In 2030, your IT organization will look completely different," Mullery said. According to a Gartner study of CIOs, 81% of IT work is done by humans without AI. By 2030, CIOs expect 75% of IT work will be done by humans augmented with AI, and 25% will be done by AI alone. Zero percent of IT work will be done without AI. This will change your entire IT estate, she said, and create extra capacity, so it's up to leaders to demonstrate extra IT value. One issue Plummer identified was using this extra capability to make up for worker shortages caused by the demographic changes. Other changes will impact the business more directly, creating what Plummer called "shock waves." For instance, he said, as AI takes over more diagnosis and virtual care allows more recovery at home, hospitals will become primarily treatment centers. Today, we are gradually adding machine autonomy around the edges of our organizations, Mullery said, moving us towards autonomous business. This is the new "agentic battleground" where multiple vendors compete to deliver teams of machine workers ready at a moment's notice. But Plummer insisted that "If we keep fighting to protect our roles of the past, we'll never reimagine our roles for the future." He said the day may come when we collectively decide we will choose not to do things like managing operations or configuring system and instead choose to have people primary nurture human connectedness. "We decide what humans will do and what AI will," he said. He even showed a digital twin of himself – AI Daryl – that could present ideas the way he would when he's not available. Such technology might uncover value hidden in the data you already have and prevent the "retirement brain drain" by training such systems on the documentation, code reviews, and meeting records of retiring employees. "When humans and AI are ready, we can transcend and ride the AI shockwaves," Mullery concluded. "Let's bring it all together and retrace our path to find, capture, and sustain value. You have to get both Ai and humans ready." Michael J. Miller is chief information officer at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

Title: IBM Replaced Employees With AI And Made A Fascinating Discovery

Innovations in artificial intelligence are among the various reasons why companies are shedding jobs, pulling back on hiring, and eliminating positions. AI enabled tech companies Microsoft, Meta, and Google to announce huge layoffs in 2025. The massive food and beverage company Nestlé also announced it was cutting 16,000 jobs worldwide, many of which were replaced with automation and AI. And the CEO of Amazon, a corporation that will soon pay a $2.5 billion settlement to eligible Amazon Prime customers, hinted there would be further AI-initiated job cuts in a letter to shareholders. Yet it turns out that when corporations do invest in AI, it can eventually lead to the creation of more jobs. At least, that was the case with IBM when, in 2023, it eliminated 8,000 jobs as it utilized an artificial intelligence program, AskHR, to automate 94% of the company's human resources functions. Two years later, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna revealed to the Wall Street Journal that his company's "total employment has actually gone up" as it seeks to employ software engineers and sales and marketing staff who are focused on "critical thinking" to do less systematic jobs that "face up or against other humans." In other words, IBM still needed people to handle tasks that dealt with people. This was found out in 2024 when, on the positive side, IBM reported saving $3.5 billion through its use of AskHR as it handled more than 11.5 million interactions. Unfortunately, IBM's AskHR could not deal with complicated workplace issues, ethical problems, and other things that required a human touch, per online magazine Resident. IBM's discovery mirrored what the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Future of Jobs Report outlined: that AI will make 92 million jobs disappear but create another 170 million new jobs between 2025 and 2030. The jobs that are expected to grow are positions requiring critical thinking, human interaction, and opposable thumbs. This means farmworkers, salespeople, food processing workers, healthcare workers, social workers, counselling professionals, construction workers, delivery drivers, and teachers could be safe, or even see an outright growth in their opportunities. On the tech side, big data specialists, financial technology engineers, machine learning specialists, and experienced software and application developers will remain in high demand. The report also anticipates there will be big growth in renewable energy engineering jobs. The jobs that will continue to head toward the chopping block thanks to AI include administrative assistants, data entry clerks, ticket clerks, and cashiers. Additionally, the WEF estimates that 39% of employees can expect to see their skills either altered or outdated by 2030, meaning a large portion of today's global workforce will need to be retrained within a few years. This disruptive trend is taking place in entry-level white-collar jobs, too. Chatbots and artificial intelligence programs are replacing the tasks once done by junior software developers, paralegals, retail associates, and even newly graduated attorneys "who once cut their teeth on document review," LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Andy Challenger, an outplacement consultant at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Bankrate that AI was among the many reasons why companies are letting people go. President Donald Trump's tariffs have had an impact on the job market as well, as companies struggle to absorb the new taxes his administration has put on imports along with a sluggish economy and an overall hangover from the post-pandemic hiring boom.

Title: Halo Co-creator slams EA for leaving Ridgeline Games devs out of Battlefield 6 credits

The co-creator of the Halo franchise and former art director on the original Halo games at Bungie, Marcus Lehto, publicly expressed disappointment over the lack of proper credits for himself and several colleagues from the now-defunct Ridgeline Games in the recent release of Battlefield 6. In a LinkedIn post on October 20, Lehto mentioned that many team members who contributed to the game’s early development were either omitted or relegated to a brief “Special Thanks” section at the end, despite playing a major role in laying the game’s foundation. In the LinkedIn post, Lehto stated, “I’m disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6.” He initially pointed out that five individuals were missing from the credits section, including software engineers Jessica Moore and Dan Carr, lead tech artist Rohan Knuckey, and lead character artist Andres Naranjo. He later corrected himself and clarified that three of them were actually credited elsewhere in the game. To honor their contributions, Lehto shared a custom image listing dozens of names and roles across cinematics, design, art, animation, engineering, and production, presenting it as how he believed the credentials should have appeared in Battlefield 6. He concluded in the post, “Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.” EA established Ridgeline Games in Seattle back in October 2021 and appointed Lehto as game director to lead the studio on FPS titles, specifically the campaign for the next Battlefield game. The studio began hiring developers in July 2022 and collaborated with Ripple Effect, formerly DICE LA, to build the game’s narrative of what would later become Battlefield 6. Lehto left EA in February 2024 of his own accord, stating he wanted to take time away from the industry to think about his future. Just a week later, EA shut down Ridgeline Games as part of a broader restructuring and laid off approximately 670 employees, and shifted away from future licensed IPs, with some staff relocated to Ripple Effect to continue work on Battlefield 6’s multiplayer development. At the time, Lehto stated that he was “incredibly upset and very sad” about the closure and layoffs, further adding that he had “nothing positive to say about EA” following his departure.Buy Battlefield 6 on Amazon Marcus Lehto – LinkedIn

Title: Companies Are Hiring Like It's 2009

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/23/2025 5:38:34 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Key TakeawaysHiring by U.S. employers has slowed to a crawl, according to recent data from Vanguard.The job creation rate is at its slowest sustained pace since 2009, when the U.S. was in a recession.Vanguard's report is one of a handful of privately created data sources available in the absence of government reports that have been delayed by the shutdown. The last time job growth was as slow as it is now, Boom Boom Pow by the Black Eyed Peas was at the top of the charts, a Bitcoin cost a quarter of a cent, and Donald Trump was best known as the host of a game show. Vanguard data found the U.S. job growth rate was just 0.1% in seven of the first nine months of 2025—an ominous sign, as the last time job growth was that slow for a sustained period was during the Great Recession in 2009. That's less than a third of the recent job growth peak of 0.36% in 2022.What This Means For The EconomyVanguard's data highlights the job market's uneasy balance: job creation is slow, but there haven't been any waves of mass layoffs. Officials at the Federal Reserve view the job market as increasingly fragile and are expected to cut interest rates to support job growth and prevent a severe increase in unemployment. Vanguard's data is one of a handful of reports on the job market created by private companies, which are still being published in the absence of official figures from the government that are being delayed by the ongoing shutdown. Vanguard's data reinforces recent findings indicating a "low hire, low fire" job market in an uneasy equilibrium. Many employers remain reluctant to either expand or reduce their workforces as they contend with the economic policies of the White House, particularly tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, according to recent surveys. The slow rate of job creation is bad news for anyone currently looking for work, but the labor market isn't yet in crisis. Unlike the early 2000s, people who currently have jobs can count on relatively stable employment, according to Vanguard.

Vanguard data found the U.S. job growth rate was just 0.1% in seven of the first nine months of 2025—an ominous sign, as the last time job growth was that slow for a sustained period was during the Great Recession in 2009. That's less than a third of the recent job growth peak of 0.36% in 2022.What This Means For The EconomyVanguard's data highlights the job market's uneasy balance: job creation is slow, but there haven't been any waves of mass layoffs. Officials at the Federal Reserve view the job market as increasingly fragile and are expected to cut interest rates to support job growth and prevent a severe increase in unemployment. Vanguard's data is one of a handful of reports on the job market created by private companies, which are still being published in the absence of official figures from the government that are being delayed by the ongoing shutdown. Vanguard's data reinforces recent findings indicating a "low hire, low fire" job market in an uneasy equilibrium. Many employers remain reluctant to either expand or reduce their workforces as they contend with the economic policies of the White House, particularly tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, according to recent surveys. The slow rate of job creation is bad news for anyone currently looking for work, but the labor market isn't yet in crisis. Unlike the early 2000s, people who currently have jobs can count on relatively stable employment, according to Vanguard.

Many employers remain reluctant to either expand or reduce their workforces as they contend with the economic policies of the White House, particularly tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, according to recent surveys. The slow rate of job creation is bad news for anyone currently looking for work, but the labor market isn't yet in crisis. Unlike the early 2000s, people who currently have jobs can count on relatively stable employment, according to Vanguard. "Hiring has slowed, but low layoff rates and solid income growth point to a labor market that remains strong for those currently employed," the company said in a blog post. Article Sources 1. Vanguard. "Data show labor market strength despite slower hiring."

Title: Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate jobs as it looks to reclaim its lost lustre

By LISA LEFF, Associated Press Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer’s customer base. About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target’s corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company’s Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said. Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target’s next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week. “The truth is, the complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname “Tarzhay.” Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target’s next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company’s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology. He cited the same goals in his message to employees, calling the layoffs a “necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,” he wrote. Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales — those from established physical stores and online channels — in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%. The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target’s sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said. The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said. Correction: This story was first published on Oct. 23, 2025. It was updated on Oct. 24, 2025, to correct the date until which terminated corporate employees will continue receiving pay and benefits. It’s Jan. 3, not Jan. 8.

Title: Peter Bart: Companies Are Pitching MOGA (Make Offices Great Again), But AI-Wary Workers Are Barely Budging

By Peter Bart Editor-At-Large For a glimpse of turmoil these days, look no further than the nearest office. “It’s an incipient war zone,” says a McKinsey study. That’s despite the fact that offices are mostly empty — both federal and corporate. The MAGA-era U.S. government pretends to function despite the absence of its workforce due to layoffs and the prolonged shutdown. Even flights take off with minimal air-traffic controllers. Meanwhile, down the block, millions in the private workplace are refusing corporate demands that they return to their offices. Having survived cutbacks and Covid, employees prefer taking Zoom calls at home in their sweat pants rather than coping with traffic or office politics. They also don’t want to read ominous forecasts about incursions from AI. Confession: I used to like going to the office; others apparently did, too. A benign show called The Office was once a TV hit in the UK and U.S., its characters sharing gossip over the water cooler. Offices brought busy people together for a common purpose. Some even hooked up. Watch on Deadline Yet employees today are rebuffing powerhouses like Amazon, J.P. Morgan and studios like NBCUniversal even as they offer compromises to lure them back. Discovering myself in the minority on the office issue troubled me, so I decided to find a way out: I asked ChatGPT to write an unbiased column in my “voice” to learn where Peter Bart really stands, or has stood. That’s what’s known today as research. Within a minute or two I was reading that offices presently are a relic — at least according to my digital avatar’s viewpoint. “Creativity doesn’t need proximity,” I wrote — apparently. My chatbot even cited a Harvard study declaring: “Gen Z executives who were schooled on Zoom and hence addicted to their phones and screens are not coping well with office interaction.” Further, the new “open plan landscape” of offices leaves workers feeling “both distracted and defenseless.” Was all this correct? Thinking back on my own scattered past, I actually enjoyed these “distractions.” I relished the high-decibel exchanges when I was a young member of the news staff of the New York Times. Also the fierce debates voiced by the motion picture production staffs at Paramount or, later, MGM. To be sure, I was occasionally pummeled as a newcomer in one job and second-guessed as the company president in another. Office life can be noisy. Hence, were I to occupy an office today I think would agree, not with the AI Peter Bart’s “voice” but with Bartleby, the superbly informed columnist of The Economist. He wrote last week that he “welcomed the constant background hum of generative AI, even though meetings now routinely end with phrases like ‘I guess I still have a job.’” Still, the overall AI lexicon troubles him: “People have no clue what they are talking about with words like ‘agentic’ or ‘non-determinism,’” he writes. Bartleby, to be sure, often works at home as do most newsmen. So what’s the bottom line? Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as more companies try to herd workers back to the office, average office attendance “has barely budged.” And managers are reluctant to crack down too intensively. “There are more pressing things for companies to worry about right now,” the Journal quotes one CEO as admitting. Hence Microsoft now demands three days a week in the office starting next February, while NBCUniversal asks for four. Ironically, Amazon’s more rigid rules have actually caused that company briefly to run short of desks. One executive admitted, ”It’s still a cheap way to reduce head count but you don’t get to choose who stays or who leaves.” What’s the solution? I asked my chatbot, who replied, “Maybe it’s not about mandates but about making the office truly matter again, not with pizza parties but with a mission.” I agree this time with my chatbot, but I hope I don’t have to settle with an AI company for the right to misquote myself.

It feels like you’re going to work at a coffeehouse every day you’re in the office. Or, now that so many jobs have been “globalized’, you’re now having meetings at 5 or 6am so you can meet with your European counterpart, or as late as 8 or 9pm to work with your Asian or Australian counterpart. And now they expect you to be in the office for these calls? The lack of a designated desk has definite psychological impact – we all know jobs are transitory but to not even be welcomed at the one you currently have enough to know you *will* have a seat treats every unassigned worker as a temp. It turns the whole office experience into a temporary one – which these days half the workers are temps anyway. When is the last time a Hollywood company instituted a policy that was *good* for their employees? Genuine question.

Title: Headgum Lays Off 30% of Staff in Latest Sign of Podcast Struggles

By Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Headgum, the comedy podcast network, laid off about 30% of its staff earlier this month amid continued headwinds in the podcast industry. Casey Donahue, the head of video, was among those affected. “It was tough, but a reminder of how volatile the industry has become,” he said. “My focus has always been on building shows and visuals that elevate the talent and the brand, and I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with my team at Headgum.” Related Stories China Box Office: ‘Row to Win’ Rises to No. 1 as 'Tron: Ares’ and ‘One Battle After Another’ Open 'One Battle After Another' Projected to Lose $100 Million Theatrically as 'Smashing Machine' and Others Also Struggle Due to Oversized Budgets Marika Brownlee, the head of marketing, was also let go after nearly a decade at the L.A.-based company. It was only the second round of layoffs during her tenure, following another round in 2022. Popular on Variety “It was definitely a shock,” she said. “It was communicated in the grand scheme of — ‘These problems are happening industrywide’ — which I know is true.” Headgum had about 22 staffers before the layoffs, which were announced on Oct. 2. The company also recently vacated its New York studio. Some were told that if the cuts were not made immediately, the company would last only a few more months. The company did not respond to a request for comment. The podcast business has been hit hard this year. In June, Pineapple Street Studios was shut down by its owner, Audacy, costing nearly 30 jobs. Spotify also cut 15 jobs in its podcast division, curtailing the headcount at The Ringer and Spotify Studios by about 5%. Wondery laid off nearly 100 employees as Amazon reorganized the company in August. Headgum, which has remained independent, appeared to have weathered the storm to some degree. In August, the company celebrated its 10th anniversary as leaders spoke about growth. “We’ve built shows streamed billions of times,” CEO Marty Michael wrote on LinkedIn in August. “We’ve grown a team I love working with. But we’ve also hit major speed bumps; talent departures, ad market freezes, all the stuff they don’t include in pitch decks. Somehow, ten years later, we’re still here. Still growing. Still having fun. But now, with a real business underneath it.” The “restructuring” was discussed Thursday on the “Doughboys” podcast, a Headgum food show hosted by Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger. “Really they just fired a bunch of people,” Wiger said. “We don’t have any sort of comprehension of what happened. We’re just living in the aftermath. But it’s a huge fucking bummer. These are very talented people who no longer have jobs.” The network hosts dozens of other shows, including “What’s Our Podcast?” with Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney; “Not Another D&D Podcast”; “Factually! with Adam Conover”; and “Handsome” with Tig Notaro, Fortune Feimster and Mae Martin.

Title: Target will lay off around 1,000 employees | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Target will lay off 1,000 corporate employees and close 800 open roles — affecting roughly 8% of its global corporate workforce — the company said Thursday. The layoffs and changes “set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned” for the future, incoming Target CEO Michael Fiddelke said in an email to employees. Fiddelke will take over from veteran CEO Brian Cornell next year, the company announced in August. The layoffs, which come ahead of the critical holiday shopping season, are the latest sign of struggles at the Minneapolis-based company. It has been been reeling from slumping sales and fierce blowback to its retreat on DEI programs. Its decision to end some of those initiatives angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies, who felt blindsided. Target had staked out a reputation as a strong corporate supporter of DEI. Target said its move weighed on sales, which have fallen for three straight quarters. Economic conditions and competition from Walmart, Amazon and Costco have also taken a toll on Target. Customers have shifted their buying patterns, purchasing less of the company’s home goods and clothing. The company’s (TGT) stock has dropped 30% in 2025, putting it among the worst-performing companies in the S&P 500 this year. A Target spokesperson said the company did not lay off employees to cut costs. Instead, it was a step to rewire its organization to make decisions more swiftly.

Business FILE PHOTO: Amazon logo is seen in this illustration taken February 11, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO :A fifteen-year veteran of Amazon’s devices division who had a hand in developing many of the most recognizable gadgets is leaving the company at the end of October, marking the second high-level departure in October. Lindo St. Angel, vice president of hardware for Lab126, plans to leave next week, Amazon confirmed following a Reuters inquiry. The circumstances of his departure could not be learned and St. Angel did not respond to a request for comment. “We are grateful for his many contributions to Amazon and wish him the best,” said a spokesperson in an emailed statement, without providing additional details about St. Angel. Earlier this month, Reuters reported, Rob Williams, device software and services vice president, and a member of the elite internal group advising CEO Andy Jassy said he had left his post. He will remain with the company through year’s end in an advisory role to devices chief Panos Panay.

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new "eyes-off" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway. In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable. What's on deck: Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down. Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division. Business: If you haven't secured a "KPop Demon Hunter" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.) But first, all in on not going all-in. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around? That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it. (Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.) Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart. For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life. Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element. Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human! Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it. "Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?" reads one of the top comments on YouTube. The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line. While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether. The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm. But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst. Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself. However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it. The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts. 1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded. 2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious. 3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors. 1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo. 3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising. 1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them "corporate terrorists." 2. Good luck finding a "KPop Demon Hunters" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon. 3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

Title: Forbes Daily: Beyond Meat Reaches Meme Stock Territory
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/10/23/forbes-daily-beyond-meat-reaches-meme-stock-territory/

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Beyond Meat may be plant-based, but investors are beefing up their holdings as the company’s stock becomes a so-called meme asset. Shares of the firm have surged over 1,000% since hitting a record intraday low last week, as the company announced its creditors had accepted a debt swap. Demand for Beyond Meat and other plant-based meat brands has softened despite initial popularity, with the company quickly becoming a penny stock after trading at around $230 during its 2019 peak. It’s the latest to be caught up in the meme stock frenzy, like Opendoor, and of course GameStop. Despite spending billions to ramp up its AI efforts, Meta said in an internal memo that it would lay off about 600 staffers at its Superintelligence Labs. Meta’s AI chief Alexandr Wang, cofounder of the firm Scale AI, characterized the layoffs as a restructuring move. Uber is incentivizing drivers in select states with a $4,000 rebate program to switch to electric vehicles for use in the company’s “Uber Electric” service. The move comes as the Trump Administration sunsetted federal tax credits for EVs, and could help spur EV demand in the final quarter. Tesla fell short of expectations in its third-quarter earnings report Wednesday, despite a historic rise in quarterly deliveries in the lead-up to the expiration of the EV tax credits. The automaker’s stock dropped more than 3% in pre-market trading this morning, though the firm actually reported revenues well above Wall Street’s predictions. MORE: Tesla chief Elon Musk called two shareholder advisory firms that are opposing his proposed $1 trillion pay package “corporate terrorists” during Wednesday's earnings call. Even amid tariff uncertainty, small business buying saw a boost in the third quarter—though there could be a downturn next quarter as the government shutdown has frozen approval of SBA-backed loans. Buyers are moving fast and prices are falling, suggesting sellers could be lowering expectations to move before conditions worsen. Palo Alto-based AI agent startup Genspark is in discussions to raise over $200 million in a new funding round that would more than double its valuation to over $1 billion. The company originally had a search product before killing it off, and intends to launch an enterprise-focused product soon. Global oil prices spiked early Thursday after the Trump Administration imposed a new set of sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies and threatened further action unless Moscow agreed to a ceasefire in its ongoing war with Ukraine. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which announced the sanctions, blamed the move on “Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war.” First Lady Melania Trump’s $MELANIA memecoin is now under legal scrutiny, as a court filing this week alleges the cryptocurrency is part of a broader fraudulent “pump-and-dump” scheme meant to enrich a small number of insiders. The lawsuit does not allege that the first lady played any role in the fraud. Women’s basketball is surging in popularity, so it makes sense that a number of the figures on Forbes’ 2025 list of America’s Most Powerful Women in Sports come from the sport. But all eyes are on the WNBA’s next contract negotiation, as its current collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of the month. As revenues hit record highs, WNBA players received just 9.3% of league income in 2022, according to Bloomberg—compared with roughly 50% for NBA players and 48% for the NFL. General Motors vehicles will soon feature a self-driving “eyes-off” system, the company said Wednesday, though it will be limited to highway driving upon release. Human intervention will only be needed for things like off-ramps, and the system will be able to handle emergencies and sudden incidents, according to TechCrunch. For the fourth year in a row, the NBA’s most valuable team is the Golden State Warriors, worth an estimated $11 billion. No other NBA team was within $300 million of the Warriors’ estimated $880 million in revenue last season, with the club far outpacing the rest of the league with its income from sponsorships and premium seating, and ranking in the top three in virtually every category tracked by Forbes. In fact, Golden State more than doubled the $417 million league average for total revenue, and compared with the other North American sports leagues, the Warriors generated more cash than every franchise except the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. But even for the rest of the NBA, business these days is very, very good. According to Forbes estimates, league-wide revenue last season was up 10% year-over-year, to roughly $12.5 billion, including money from non-NBA events held at teams’ arenas but netting out arena debt service. And another significant jump is coming in 2025-26—the first season of the 11-year, $76 billion national media package the NBA signed last year with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video. With all of that cash pouring in, Forbes estimates that the 30 NBA teams are worth $5.4 billion on average—or just over $160 billion collectively—representing an increase of 21% over last year and more than doubling the average of $2.5 billion from just four seasons ago. WHY IT MATTERS “The Celtics sold for a blended valuation of roughly $6.7 billion in August, and the Lakers are awaiting the NBA’s approval for a $10 billion transaction—figures that, given the franchises’ business performance in 2024-25, make them look more like fast-growing tech startups than sports teams in a nearly 80-year-old league,” says Forbes senior editor Brett Knight. “Forbes now values the 30 pro basketball teams at 12.9 times last season’s revenue on average, well ahead of the other major men’s leagues, which demonstrates just how desperate investors are to break into basketball. And no one is expecting that to change anytime soon.” MORE How Modern Sports Arenas Make Millions More By Building Fewer Luxury Suites The first half of the year was the costliest ever in terms of climate disasters in the wake of wildfires in Los Angeles, tornadoes in the Midwest and severe storms across the South. Nonprofit Climate Central started tracking the data after federal funding cuts ended NOAA research on the topic earlier this year: $101 billion: The total damages so far this year 14: The number of disasters costing $1 billion or more 16,000: The number of buildings destroyed by the Los Angeles wildfires in January, which ranks as the 10th most expensive climate disaster in U.S. history Even if you think you did everything right on your tax return, it’s natural to worry about being audited by the IRS. The basic rule is that the IRS has three years after you file your return to audit you—but there are a number of exceptions, and the agency has no time limit on auditing you if you never file or file fraudulently. It’s critical to keep good records, report all your income and consider having a tax professional prepare your return.

Hundreds of AI jobs cut at Meta When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta is cutting around 600 roles in its artificial intelligence division, a report from Axios has claimed. It’s believed Meta’s legacy AI research group and some product and infrastructure divisions may be affected, but employees in the new superintelligence labs should remain unaffected. The company, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has already previously committed to reducing organizational inefficiencies, and this round of layoffs seems to align with those efforts rather than being a response to economic headwinds and ongoing labor market trends. The report claims Alexandr Wang from Meta’s superintelligence labs noted smaller teams can make faster decisions, resulting in more impact. Internally, Meta’s AI unit was also considered pretty large and inefficient. Despite the cuts, Meta isn’t necessarily saying goodbye to those workers – they can reapply for other roles within the organization if they choose not to accept the severance package, said to be worth 16 weeks of pay plus two weeks per completed year of service. Moreover, the company remains committed to building out its AI models and making other investments in AI infrastructure to compete with the likes of OpenAI, Amazon and Google. In 2025, Meta’s expenses could reach $114-118 billion, with AI driving even higher costs in 2026.

The company’s 29th data center, a campus with the potential to scale up to 1GW in El Paso, Texas, is already said to “support both the traditional servers of today and future generations of AI-enabled hardware,” reflecting Meta’s long-term commitment. Since warning employees of an “intense year” and laying off 3,600 workers in February 2025, Zuckerberg hasn’t cut as many workers as we might’ve expected – 100 in April and 600 this month, per layoffs.fyi.

Title: Robots May Replace 600,000 Human Employees at Amazon

The retail giant plans to expand its non-human workforce, with the goal of automating 75% of its operations, according to The New York Times. Amazon may use robots to displace warehouse workers in big numbers. Robots have been a staple at Amazon warehouses for more than a decade, performing tasks formerly completed by humans, including picking, sorting and moving packages. Now, Amazon plans to make human labor less necessary in its facilities by replacing more than half a million jobs with robots, The New York Times reports. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."
