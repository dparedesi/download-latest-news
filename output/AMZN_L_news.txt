Title: Federal Workers Rise up Against Musk, Trump and Drastic Cuts

Chris Dols was one of hundreds who flooded to the streets of Washington, D.C. this week to protest the shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was one of the few remnants of the 2008 financial crisis that actually aimed to help ordinary people. The workers locked out of the agency spoke about their jobs, the value of the work they did, reminding themselves and their audience that federal employees have vital jobs that working Americans rely on. Naturally, that’s placed it in the crosshairs of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has so far functioned like a private hit squad, moving in and out of various government offices in what Reuters, based on the analysis of two Republican experts, called ​“an ideological assault on federal agencies long hated by conservatives.” Dols, a founding member of a new network of federal workers organizing to counter the attacks from President Donald Trump and Musk, thought the targeting of CFPB clarified what Musk and Trump’s real agenda is. “[The CFPB] is the protection for consumers against fraud,” he said. ​“The grifters went after the anti-grifting agency.” If Trump and Musk really cared about cutting waste and fraud and improving the lives of working people, he noted, they’d be strengthening and expanding the CFPB’s reach, rather than slashing it. Lauren, a worker with the Bureau of Land Management who did not want to give her last name for fear of being targeted, noted that while Musk is bragging about returning the CFPB’s budget ​“to the taxpayers,” that’s pennies compared to the $21 billion the CFPB has returned to Americans who’d been ripped off by financial institutions since its inception in 2011. “I don’t know if people have already forgotten how devastating that financial crisis was and how many lives it upended,” she said. Dols, Lauren and the other members of the Federal Unionists Network (FUN) have been preparing for Trump’s assault on the public workforce and swung into action in the months since his election. (All of the workers I spoke to for this article provided their job title and union membership for ID purposes only and stressed they are only speaking in a personal capacity, not on behalf of their employer or their union.) Those workers are engineers like Dols — who works at the Army Corps of Engineers as a dredging expert and is president of Local 98 of International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — but also healthcare providers, legal experts, and other professionals who, together, make up a federal workforce of more than two million now under threat of removal by an administration bent on wreaking havoc on the very idea that government can improve the lives of its citizens. They’ve called for a day of action on February 19, and more broadly, for federal workers and anyone who wants to save public services to step up and learn to organize. “We have a ton to learn from all the people who are going to come in,” Dols said. ​“Everybody needs to become an organizer right now.” In addition to opposing DOGE’s roving hits, the FUN has focused on Trump’s offer to buy out federal workers. The offer has Musk’s fingerprints all over it — the email making the original buyout offer was titled ​“Fork in the Road,” the same title Musk used in a similar email to Twitter employees when he acquired the social networking site — and a number of unions have filed multiple lawsuits against the buyout. But a judge removed a freeze placed on the offer while the lawsuits proceeded on Wednesday, at least temporarily allowing it to go forward. (In These Times reached out to Musk Friday with questions about this article and have not yet received a response.) Whether it is legally halted or not, Dols pointed out, the buyout has fallen short of the administration’s hopes. Something like 3% of the workforce has reportedly accepted the buyout — as Dols noted, in a given year, the turnover due to retirement or normal resignation is closer to 5%. ​“Federal workers obviously don’t trust it, they feel this is an attack. This is a scam.” The court’s decision to let the buyout proceed, he said, ​“should show us that it’s going to be up to organized labor to wage the fight and not to trust the courts.” “They know they’re creating a crisis. It’s intentional,” Dols said. ​“They think they can manage the crisis. They wouldn’t create it if they didn’t think they could manage it. Our job is to make it unmanageable.” “Many of these things that we’re seeing from this administration are designed to strike fear into people,” Colin Smalley, also with the Army Corps of Engineers and president of Local 777 of IFPTE, told me. ​“And a lot of folks out there have been building community in anticipation of this. They’ve been building a place to turn to, whether that’s organized labor or whether it’s the folks that you do a community garden with or your church or whatever it is that you can turn to be with other people and accomplish something together. To me, that’s the work that beats this division and chaos.” Smalley, like Dols, began organizing federal workers within and beyond his union a few years ago, and the two of them ran on a joint ticket for IFPTE leadership in 2024, highlighting the danger that a potential Trump victory posed to the federal workforce. While the Trump/​Musk chaos is unprecedented in recent history, he said, their tactics are recognizable: ​“They use some of the same tactics as traditional union busting tactics in the private sector, that these so-called union avoidance firms preach,” he said. ​“One of the reasons we knew it was going to be bad is because things have been getting bad before January 20. They were getting bad before November. Things have been getting bad for working people for a long time.” Being prepared for a Trump return was a form of inoculation, Dols added. ​“You talk about what might happen so that people are prepared for it so that when they actually encounter it, it’s not the first time that it’s happening to them, and it’s not totally disorienting.” The network now known as FUN grew out of a campaign to confirm former President Joe Biden’s nominees to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA, the agency which manages labor relations for the federal workforce), and evolved into a grassroots rank-and-file network across unions and agencies across the country. Mark Smith, an occupational therapist and health educator with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in San Francisco, as well as president of National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1, explained, ​“We really wanted a way to connect with each other and learn from each other and build a bit more of a fighting labor movement in the federal sector, to defend the public sector and public services more broadly from just the 40 year assault on public services in this country.” The challenge for organized labor in this moment, Dols said, is to move away from a mobilization strategy — bring people to a rally, wave some placards, and go home — to ​“an actual mass participation organizing model.” That means building, day by day, bigger, stronger unions, adding new members and training the ones that exist. ​“We need orders of magnitude more people learning how to take action and organize action and compel their coworkers into action. That’s the only way we’re going to have the forces in place that can win these arguments, let alone win elections.” Part of their strategy, he added, is being willing to challenge the Democrats on their failures — something that much of the labor movement has been unwilling to do, and if it has, it’s often been to cozy up to Trump instead. Those early campaigns didn’t succeed — those Biden nominees were never, in fact, confirmed, nor did Dols and Smalley win national leadership — but each attempt brought in new members and taught them more about what federal workers wanted and needed. The network now known as the FUN was small, compared to the massive federal workforce, but it was in the right place when Trump was announced the winner in November, and ready to fight. “People were looking for where to go to resist what was coming,” Dols said. ​“We’re in the middle of this massive growth spurt.” Their upcoming day of action on February 19 is in some ways a structure test, to see the breadth of that growth in action. Under the slogan ​“SOS, Save Our Services,” they are at once making a distress call to the broader public, and providing a visible pole of attraction for people to join. That call has already been working — ​“The federal workforce is awakening,” Smith said — as workers rush to join the various federal unions. (The entire federal sector is open shop, meaning workers don’t have to be members of the union to receive the benefits of its collective bargaining.) “I’ve had more people sign up for the union in the last week than in six months previously. As we say in the labor movement” Smith said, ​“a bad boss is the best organizer.” To Smalley, it’s important to show the country the real work that federal employees do, to counter Musk’s railing about ​“unelected” bureaucracy. ​“The Right now loves to call us unelected bureaucrats. The idea is that these unelected bureaucrats are somehow making decisions that are unaccountable to the public when the reality couldn’t be further from the truth for most federal workers.” (Musk, of course, was also not elected by anyone.) Many people, those who may have voted for Trump and believed in his promises to cut government waste, but also those who broadly oppose his policies, don’t really know what the federal workforce looks like, where it’s located, or the variety of jobs it contains. But federal workers are all over the country, in every community, in cities and on rural lands. The government, Smalley said, ​“looks like books in our libraries. It looks like trees in our parks. It looks like people getting the healthcare that they need, and folks that have contributed to their communities for a full life aren’t destitute and suffering on the street. These guys are trying to take a torch to the entire concept that we should care about each other as humans.” Lauren, for instance, works for the Department of the Interior in New Mexico. ​“The majority of the American public does not even know about the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), what we do and the extent to which we operate,” she said. ​“It is a huge contribution to economic development, but also in terms of what we’re addressing and facing with climate change, environmental justice, we’re really at that nexus for those issues.” And during the last Trump administration, they brought the hatchet down on BLM headquarters, forcing a relocation to Colorado from D.C., and dispersed others around the country. Many employees left their jobs rather than move, and Trump has pointed to this strategy as something he’d like to replicate this time around. MT Snyder, meanwhile, another FUN member, is a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco. Her day-to-day is conducting union representation elections and investigating unfair labor practice charges for private sector workers. “I drive all over Northern California to any facility where there’s going to be a union election and manually conduct these elections, secret ballot elections using paper ballots and a cardboard box.” She studied labor relations in graduate school and wanted to dedicate her life to supporting workers’ right to organize. This is true of many federal employees, Smith said. ​“This administration has kind of shot itself in the foot multiple times already with the emails they’re sending to two million federal employees saying that you should consider a high productivity job in the private sector and get away from your low productivity job in the public sector,” he said. The physicians and nurses and other healthcare professionals at the VHA, he said, could work anywhere, but chose public service, and telling them that they are ​“low productivity” has only fired them up. Those VHA workers are all over the country: they are psychologists, social workers, speech therapists, chaplains, health scientists, researchers, pharmacists, and doctors and nurses. ​“They come for the mission of serving veterans, and then also avoiding much of the moral injury that I think happens in the private sector where you’re not able to deliver the care that you would want to be able to because people can’t pay or the insurance company doesn’t want to pay.” Beyond the VHA, the union Smith belongs to, the NFFE, represents workers in the forest service, including the kinds of wildland firefighters that have been desperately needed to fight the recent wildfires in Southern California. There are National Park Service workers who might lose their seasonal jobs with Trump’s hiring freeze, park rangers who, Lauren said, ​“are living in trailers because they can’t afford housing in the communities that they serve.” “This idea that we’re overpaid and not doing our jobs and are only located in D.C. is just patently false,” she said. ​“They’re acting like our agencies are overfunded and inefficient, but we’re basically accomplishing our missions on drastically reduced budgets.” The IFPTE, Smalley said, represents workers like him, at the Army Corps of Engineers, who do things like prevent flooding and help with disaster recovery — again, deeply necessary work after this year’s violent storms — and ecosystem restoration. “We represent the scientists and engineers as well as the folks that work on the business end of things with the money and the economists and planners. But we also have equipment mechanics, lock and dam operators, crane operators. There’s a tugboat crew that we represent on the Great Lakes.” And those people, Snyder added, those rank-and-file workers across a wide array of industries, job titles, unions and states, are fighting to keep providing those services — and fighting for the idea of government as something that provides for people at all. “My office is full of attorneys who could double their income by moving to the private sector,” Snyder said. ​“I think that Musk and this administration don’t understand how much public servants care about the work that they do. And we’ll fight to make sure that the public will continue to benefit from our services.” The battle to save public services predates Trump and his alliance with Musk. ​“Outsourcing and privatization has been increasing exponentially for more than a decade, including under both Democrat and Republican appointees,” Smith said. The Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME (2018) made the rest of the public sector open shop, a move that built on decades of demonizing public employees, from teachers to social workers, as greedy leeches draining the pockets of ordinary working people. In 2010, a wave of Republican governors like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attempted to crush public workers’ unions on the state level, and Trump and Musk are out to do the same on the federal level. That effort has led to some overheated, verging-on-unhinged rhetoric from the Right. Russ Vought, Trump’s choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, has said ​“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” (Not to be outdone, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during his failed presidential campaign that he would ​“start slitting throats” in the federal bureaucracy.) Democrats, meanwhile, rarely succeed in undoing these attacks. ​“When the Democrats are in power, it tends to be that everything is about bipartisanship and compromise. And so rather than making strides forward, we’re making small strides back,” Smalley said. ​“Whereas in Republican administrations, generally we’re getting thrown as far back as they possibly can, and we’re in a defensive mode.” Nearly every worker I spoke with mentioned chronic underfunding at their agencies, chronic pressure to do more with less. The attacks on the federal sector are just the beginning, Lauren noted. ​“They’re not going to stop with us.” The public sector is, after all, still one of the few bastions of good employment — while it pays less than private sector work, the stability, protections, and sense of mission compensate, or at least, they have in the past. “We are the proof to the American working class that there is a better way. You don’t have to be peeing in a bottle in the back of an Amazon van or working 80 hours a week,” Smalley said. ​“Those of us who work in government, a lot of us came specifically for the better working conditions. And the people like Elon Musk are trying to destroy that status quo so that they can gaslight all of America into forgetting that there’s a better way.” If they succeed, there will be a trickle-down effect on the rest of the country, just not the one that Republicans have long promised. Rather than money, it’ll be shoddy working conditions that spread. Trump has already fired members of the NLRB and the FLRA, preventing those authorities from doing their jobs, despite the law stating that those members can only be removed ​“for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.” Employers can essentially flout the law, secure in the knowledge that the board can’t act to stop them. Despite all the shock and awe, Snyder said, workers are digging in, and her union’s members are more engaged than ever. ​“We’re having emergency meetings, we are coming up with ideas, we’re making our own pins, making our own slogans. Members of my local know that this fight is dire. The stakes are incredibly high.” The incursions by DOGE have been shocking, Smalley noted, and reach well beyond the employees at places like the CFPB. ​“They are attempting to corporatize every square inch of the federal government.” Most notably, DOGE has accessed the Treasury payments system, and databases which contain, according to one Associated Press article, ​“information about individual and business taxes, medical records, Social Security payments and numbers, and government payments, as well as a long list of other personal data, such as birthdates, home addresses and phone numbers, military records and disability information.” The process is chaotic, sloppy, and while the cruelty is, as so many have noted for years, the point, it is also true that it is not a well thought out process. ​“I work in the Department of Defense, and we’ve seen the phrase ​‘national security’ applied at least three different ways,” Smalley said, to exempt and then un-exempt workers from freezes, cuts, buyouts and layoffs. Beyond the cruelty, the economic impact of the massive layoffs that the administration is considering would be massive. The demonization of public sector workers tends to ignore the fact that decently paid public employees do in fact pay taxes, shop in local stores and online, and contribute to the stability of their communities. If they lose jobs en masse, there will be ripple effects in local economies. The fight is, at the end of the day, about the very nature of government, Smalley said. ​“The way that coming together as a community has been organized in this country is through government. Government is not some abstraction, some monolithic thing. It’s people in our community serving each other.” To beat Trump and Musk at their own game, Dols said, the fightback will have to be broader than one union or one sector, even one as massive as the federal sector. “All the unions that are keeping their head down hoping that they don’t come after them [should know] they’re coming after everybody. The sooner you stand up with each other, the better,” he said. ​“You make the argument that this is an attack on the public by the billionaires. So which side are you on?” The February 19 day of action is an opportunity to pick a side, and to demonstrate it. One part of it will be online — the FUN is asking people to post pictures of themselves wearing red, white and blue and describing the services they provide, if they’re a federal worker, or how they benefit from those services if they’re not. They should get together in person, to take photos but also to be seen in public, to invite others to join. They’re also calling in-person rallies, including at Tesla stores all across the country, Snyder said. “This is about showing each other that we can be courageous together,” Smalley said, ​“and that in the face of the attempts to make us afraid and to make us divided and to make us feel hopeless, that we can turn all of those narratives with something as simple as coming together to remind ourselves why we do our jobs, why we come to work, no matter where that work is.” Supporters can join those events, but it’s also important, Smith said, for regular people to be calling their members of Congress — Democrat or Republican — and demand that the attacks on public servants stop. If they’re union members in a different sector, they can call on their union to support the federal workers’ efforts. It is a moment, the workers all stressed, to be building bridges rather than demanding ideological purity. As the effects of Trump’s cuts and attacks are felt, Smalley said, ​“People who have traditionally thought that they didn’t have much in common with working class people, maybe they don’t identify as part of the working class, they’re going to be affected, and they’re going to need that same community that we’re building right now, and we’re going to be here ready to work with them.” At the same time, Dols stressed, it is a moment for political education, for focusing on the billionaires and others who are materially benefiting from Trumpism. “They are rich because we are poor,” he said. ​“And if they want to say let ​‘er rip so that the economy booms, it’s just going to exacerbate all of the contradictions that gave rise to all of the regulations that are in place. The establishment is forgetting that the labor protections enforced by the NLRB, and the regulations that are enforced by various regulatory agencies, were all put in place to stabilize the system because the system is crisis prone.” This requires, again, organizing beyond a few social media snaps and reposts. The Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC) is starting a project focusing on organizing federal workers who don’t already have a union, Dols said, and despite the stifling of the various labor boards, workers can still behave like a union whether or not they’re legally recognized. As for FUN, ​“We’re going to do everything we can to maximize our surface area, create opportunities for people to come in and take ownership over it,” Dols said. They want to build a democratic mass organization out of the network, and to do that, they need to organize a lot of new members. The fight ahead is going to be a marathon, not a sprint — a phrase well beyond cliché at this point, but it’s one worth remembering in this moment. ​“Some of us who are inclined to sprint — and God knows I’m inclined to sprint — have to make sure we’re making strategic choices to scale up in a way that’s sustainable because part of their crisis plan is to burn us out,” Dols continued. “Those of us who are already in the trenches need to pace ourselves in a way that we can survive this long run and in the process, enlist and train as many other people to walk and then to jog and then to run alongside us,” he said. “This isn’t going to be solved by a handful of really clever organizers. It’s going to be solved by an army of organizers mobilizing the broader public to make this crisis unmanageable for ​‘em.” Sarah Jaffe is a writer and reporter living in New Orleans and on the road.

Title: The Gloves Are Off: Amazon’s Quebec Layoffs Spark Backlash

Time Published: 2025-02-14T19:01:12Z

Good e-Reader 14 February 2025 by Angela Waterfield Leave a Comment Amazon’s recent decision to shut down all seven of its Quebec warehouses, laying off more than 1,900 workers, is more than just another round of corporate restructuring—it’s a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between multinational corporations and labor unions. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), representing the affected workers, has wasted no time launching legal action, seeking to annul the layoffs, reopen the warehouses, and secure compensation for employees. The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances.

Title: The Gloves Are Off: Amazon’s Quebec Layoffs Spark Backlash

Good e-Reader 14 February 2025 by Angela Waterfield Leave a Comment Amazon’s recent decision to shut down all seven of its Quebec warehouses, laying off more than 1,900 workers, is more than just another round of corporate restructuring—it’s a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between multinational corporations and labor unions. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), representing the affected workers, has wasted no time launching legal action, seeking to annul the layoffs, reopen the warehouses, and secure compensation for employees. The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances. To be fair, he may have had a genuine change of heart, but for many employees and consumers, his shifting stance only deepens uncertainty about where he truly stands. The outcome of the CSN’s lawsuit remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: This isn’t just a labor dispute—it’s a test case for the power dynamics between multinational corporations, governments, and organized labor in an era of economic turbulence.

Title: Bezos’ Blue Origin Cuts 10% of Jobs to Ramp Up Rocket Launches

Blue Origin is reportedly planning on letting go of approximately 10% of its workforceâabout 1,000 employeesânearly a month after the inaugural liftoff of New Glenn. The company is hoping to focus on growth over the next few years, increasing the production and launch cadence of its new giant rocket. In an email sent to employees on Thursday, Blue Origin CEO David Limp announced the layoffs that will affect “positions in engineering, (research and development), and program/project management and thinning out our layers of management,â according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN. After years of delays, Blue Origin finally debuted its New Glenn rocket on January 16. The heavy-lift launch vehicle blasted off from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the first time a Blue Origin rocket reached orbit (the companyâs New Shepard rocket, used for space tourism purposes, is suborbital). New Glenn’s second stage reached its target orbit following a pair of successful burns of the BE-3U engines, while its booster was lost during descent. The company was hoping to carry out a soft landing of the booster on an ocean-based platform, but alas, that didn’t happen. Still, the rocket’s inaugural flight was a major success. During an all-hands call on Thursday, Limp argued that the company’s decision to let go of more than 1,000 employees would help Blue Origin scale the manufacturing of New Glenn and increase its launch cadence, Reuters reported. The rocket could pose some serious competition for SpaceX, further fueling the rivalry between Blue Origin’s founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk. New Glenn is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of lifting 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit. The 313-foot-tall (95-meter) rocket has a reusable first stage, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. By comparison, SpaceXâs Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying 63 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 26 metric tons to geostationary orbit. SpaceX has been an industry favorite for years, while Bezos’ Blue Origin finally got it together last year under new leadership. The company replaced Bob Smith as CEO, hiring former Amazon executive LimpÂ as his replacement. Blue Origin employees, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that Limp has been tasked with streamlining the company’s business units and pushing for greater focus on New Glenn, providing an overall sense of urgency after years of stagnation. Limp’s push for speed, however, has affected morale and company culture, Blue Origin employees told Reuters. It’s good to see the company making progress on its space ambition, but that, unfortunately, seems to have come at a price. blue originJeff Bezosnew glenn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to Cut 10% of Workforce to Compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX

Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its employees to streamline operations and improve its competitive position against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The Seattle Times reports that Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp informed employees of the impending layoffs via email, citing the need to reduce bureaucracy and sharpen the company’s focus. The 10 percent cut, which will impact over 1,000 workers across engineering, research and development, and management roles, are part of a broader strategy to scale up manufacturing output and launch frequency. The announcement caught many employees off guard, with some expressing concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the ability to meet ambitious goals with a reduced workforce. Blue Origin, which employs between 11,000 and 14,000 people, including more than 4,000 in Washington state, did not provide a breakdown of how the layoffs would affect its various locations. The move comes on the heels of the successful launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, a milestone that was seen as a step forward in the company’s efforts to catch up with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, the company has faced criticism for its slow pace of progress and bloated structure under previous leadership. Limp, who joined Blue Origin in 2023 after leading Amazon’s devices and services division, has sought to bring a more Amazon-like approach to the company, emphasizing efficiency and rapid growth. This shift in culture has been seen as a departure from the “slow and steady” philosophy embodied by the company’s tortoise mascot and Latin motto, “gradatim ferociter” (step by step, ferociously). Despite the layoffs, Limp expressed optimism about Blue Origin’s future, outlining an ambitious agenda for 2025 that includes landing on the Moon, delivering a record number of engines, and establishing a regular launch cadence for its New Glenn and New Shepard rockets. He also noted that the company would continue to hire in areas that support its goals and customer focus. The layoffs at Blue Origin reflect a broader trend in the aerospace industry, as companies grapple with the challenges of scaling up production and achieving profitability in an increasingly competitive market.

Title: Price Hikes, Enshittification Trigger 700K Customer Losses At Disney+, ESPN+

Culture Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we’ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV. That has involved chasing pointless “growth of growth’s sake” megamergers and imposing bottomless price hikes and new annoying restrictions (like equating password sharing with “piracy”) — all while simultaneously cutting corners on product quality in a bid to give Wall Street that sweet, impossible, unlimited quarterly growth it demands. Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all now owned by the same company thanks to consolidation) all recently raised prices to access streaming catalogs of deteriorating quality. Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain. So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss: “Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.” Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base. Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand. Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices. I’d expect two major trends in streaming over the next few years. One, a significant uptick in pointless, shitty mergers that trigger layoffs, huge debt loads, more price hikes to recoup that debt, and steady product quality erosion (see: the whole AT&T→Time Warner→Discovery mess). Media execs are very excited for the Trump administration to rubber stamp even more problematic consolidation. Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously. Filed Under: disney plus, enshittification, espn plus, price hikes, streaming, television, tv, video Companies: disney In terms of entshittification, Disney has made it even worse: the ad-free subscription tier is no longer a guarantee of avoiding ads. If I didn’t know any better, I would say they’re actively trying to get people to pirate their content. TBF, Disney’s only following Amazon in enshittification. I dunno about that. Changing the terms and conditions just so people can’t sue for false advertising is more shitty to me. It sounds bad, and I haven’t reviewed the specific agreements, but many web site agreements require users to hold them harmless and even indemnify them. In other words, if you sued them, you’d be paying their legal bills and any amount the court awarded you. In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. (I found such a clause in the terms of the payment provider my landlord wanted me to sign up with—a company that wanted access to pull money directly from my bank account while offloading all responsibility for their errors onto me. Needless to say, I complained, and I’m using checks again like it’s the 1980s.) In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. Oh, no worries, Disney covered that as well. People really need to start treating this shit as they’d treat actual contracts. If Disney handed guests a binder of legalese to sign before being let into the park, well, the lawyers would be happy, because their kids would be walking right onto otherwise-deserted rides. But the company would probably have to backtrack pretty quickly, just as Walmart would if they made everyone sign the printed walmart.com agreement and its ancillary policies before entering a store. Somehow, if it’s online, people will be eager to agree to literally almost anything. I find that people sign paper contracts in person that are also onerous and stupid because society has forced them to turn off their brains and has forced them to blow exorbitant amounts of cash they don’t have on things they wouldn’t need if they wern’t structured to force these needs. Then there are also those who sign just cuz they want stuff, which is also frequently a social disease. So, should it be called “endisneyfication”? That was already a thing, but you can roll all the stupid Disney behaviors up in that coinage. [I]s your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill? They almost got me with the last one until I read the fine print. So Disney+ lost 700k customers. On a total of over 150 million subscribers, that’s less than half a percent. I imagine their departure was more than made up for with the price hike for the remaining customers. I guess the beancounters are striving for a balance between raising prices fast enough to appease the stock market and slow enough so less customers bail. Anyway, they’re not in this business for the entertainment value or the service to their customers. Hard to say. Even if they’re making the money back from increasing fees, it doesn’t look good to the shareholders that they lost almost 1.5 million subscribers across two platforms. Especially for the ad-based products. If raising prices results in fewer subscriptions but the total profit is up, I can’t see investors having an issue with that. But if raising prices is impacting ad impressions… THAT has a cascade effect. It’s shocking they have that many subscribers given how Usanians keep complaining they can’t even afford food. Subscribe through a burner credit card. Subscribe through a burner credit card. That’s a better answer than simply no longer paying their monthly bills. But I must confess, how does one obtain a ‘burner’ card… without being totally dishonest about one’s identity in the first place? Credit issuers have their own rules about these kinds of things, let alone the laws regarding fraud, etc. My version of a ‘burner’ is where my debit and credit cards are issued by a credit union. At my union, I have the power to designate a black list of companies no longer permitted to lay charges against my card/account. Wherein I am honest and don’t wait for the service provider to cut me off, I simply stop using the service entirely, on my own. My premise is that if they turn me into collections, they’ll have to provide documentation that I never tried to cancel through their ‘official’ channel(s), and that I did indeed use the service and then failed to pay for it. I’ve told more than one collection outfit to get me those proofs, beyond just a simple billing statement, and for sure, it’s never happened. It’s worked so far. N.B. Note that states may have different laws regarding the necessary proof. What I described is what my state requires, your state may be different. I do know that collectors will try to skate around these laws and brute-force you into paying, but hold your ground. Or at the very least, get educated on what your state allows (or requires) a collector to do. I use virtual credit cards. If they won’t let me unsubscribe then I can just cancel the card. It works because the amounts are too small to take you to court, or for a debt collector to put in much effort. But, technically, you’d be on the hook for fees till you canceled, and we don’t know whether a court would accept a “it was too hard to cancel” defense. It’s getting very visible in my bubble. Piracy is flourishing again. Of course these companies will point to piracy as the cause of their losses, no the consequence as it actually is. And they’ll extract huge figures incompatible with their actual self-imposed losses and generally taken from their collective arses. could boycotts also be affecting subs? 700k subscribers lost against 125 million overall, with 24 million on ESPN+ alone, means total subscribers went down 3%, which isn’t nothing. It is directly tied to the price increase from $9.99 to $15. It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves, from Reddit and Twitter locking their APIs to Netflix and Disney+ increasing their prices for no good reason. Tesla went from being the cool electric car company to the car people are embarrassed to drive and have to slap bumper stickers on saying they bought it before Elon became a fascist president unelect. Most of Teslas revenue last year was from licensing [https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-tesla-earnings-stock-elon-musk-trump-accounting-ev-2025-1?op=1](and selling cryptocurrencies), it seems. All that being said, you forgot to call anyone brunchlords, Karl, so this article is bad and you are a monster. I made this account to leave this comment. Thumbs down, unsubscribbled. Disgusting. #dobetterkarl Rough back-of-the-envelope est is ESPN/ABC is locked into ~$4B/yr in sportsball contracts. To make it worse, NBA ratings are down 5% this year. So losing even 700K subscribers is going to leave a mark It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves It may feel like it, but is it happening? Are they dying? Certainly Disney isn’t. Video entertainment is an oligopoly, and the copyright monopolists can abuse their position to withhold stuff from any companies who’d want to undercut them. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I think it’s too soon to tell with Tesla. It could end up like Enron, but for now its stock price and sales remain high. “Fascist president unelect” might be a selling point for Trump voters who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in electric cars. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Unless you mean de facto legal, then yeah. I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Uploading copyrighted stuff without permission is usually illegal (though rarely criminal at non-commercial scale). Downloading is usually not, and in fact is sometimes explicitly legal due to copyright levies. they’ve learned nothing from history or experience To be fair, it’s not that they don’t learn. Capitalism dictates that revenue must go up. If they weren’t using the main leverage they have to make the line go up, they’d be replaced. Short of changing the rules of capitalism, there’s no other end than enshittification for such large enterprises. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Jeff Bezos-Backed Space Company Blue Origin To Lay Off 10% Workforce

Full Content:
Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin LLC is cutting about 10% of its workforce, a significant pullback aimed at slashing costs and refocusing resources after years of development work. The rocket and engine maker laid out the personnel shakeup during an all-hands employee meeting with Chief Executive Officer Dave Limp Thursday morning, confirming a workforce reduction first reported by Bloomberg. In a memo sent to employees, Limp said the company's growth led to "more bureaucracy and less focus" than needed after a hiring spree over the past few years. After years of expansion bankrolled by Bezos, who started Amazon.com Inc. and is the world's third-richest person, Blue Origin is looking to trim manager ranks as it works to clear some $10 billion worth of launch contracts. With a staff of more than 10,000, the layoffs stand to impact over 1,000 roles. Blue Origin is eliminating positions in engineering, research and development, and project management, as well as "thinning out our layers of management," Limp wrote in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg. The surprise round of layoffs comes about a month after Blue Origin debuted its flagship New Glenn rocket following years of delays and development setbacks. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. Since then, the company's payroll has gone as high as roughly 14,000 employees spread across its headquarters in the Seattle area and sprawling manufacturing and launch operations sites in Florida, Texas and Alabama. Blue Origin maintains an ambitious space portfolio that includes space tourism, a moon lander, space station and supplying rocket engines.

AI layoffs are starting in tech but there are replacement jobs for tech workers. AI Axing so-called ‘underperformers’ at Google and Meta. The pain is spread worldwide and will affect several thousand employees, many of whom earn mid-six figure salaries. While technology jobs are among the first impacted by AI-powered workforce reduction, these workers still have their pick of repalcement jobs. AI makes good programmers great programmers. And great programmers do the work of two or more people. DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 23: Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei attends the 55th Annual Meeting of the ...

Screen capture of a dramatic moment in Kavan Cardoza's short Star Wars fan film. The Best Star Wars Movie in Years is Made With AI. Filmmaker Kavan Cardoza, who goes by his social media handle, Kavan the Kid, has released The Ghost’s Apprentice, a stunning AI-generated Star Wars fan film. Using Google Veo, Midjourney, and Runway, he created the 11.5-minute short in just 14 days, pushing AI tools to their limits. His previous AI-generated Batman short drew Warner Bros.’ legal attention, and Star Wars may follow suit. But instead of shutting him down, Hollywood should be learning from him. Cardoza’s Phantom X studio is already attracting interest from major brands and studios. This is scary. “In this latest AI short film/vignette,” says filmmaker Davide Bianca of Shifting Tides, “I wanted to experiment with the idea of building tension through silence, and see if I could create something truly eerie and unsettling, not through jump scares or heavy exposition, but through subtle characterization and minimal dialogue.” Extensive performance capture was done with Runway Gen3 Act 1 and an iPhone, and prompted performance in Kling 1.6, to create a sense of heightened awareness between the characters. Every glance, every subtle movement, and every moment of stillness had to carry weight. The challenge was to make the characters feel hyper-aware of each other without relying on excessive dialogue.” This column is also a podcast hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and co-founder of Red Camera, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

Title: Silicon Valley Software Engineers Horrified as They Can't Easily Find Jobs Anymore

Back in 2021, the tech industry was booming. Fueled by generous government subsidies and the pandemic economy, tech companies went on a hiring spree, promising unlimited time off and upward growth opportunities at open offices where kombucha and cold brew flowed from taps. Flash forward to now, and those taps have run dry. A seemingly endless wave of mass layoffs is ravaging the tech industry as startup fails skyrocket and tech giants shovel their operating budgets into the AI furnace. And of all the workers devastated by the carnage, former tech workers in Silicon Valley are having a particularly rough go of it. The region's former software engineers and developers — whose jobs were previously thought to be ironclad — are now having to contend with a fiercely competitive job market in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. Many, like former Indeed managing engineer Daelynn Moyer, are considering leaving the industry altogether. The 55 year old life-long tech worker told the Washington Post that she's considering selling her house and retiring early to a farm, after 160 job applications went nowhere. "It would be a meager existence, but it would be fulfilling," Moyer told the paper. "I would no longer feel like a no longer useful commodity." Moyer isn't alone — industry events are becoming desperate job fairs full of unemployed tech workers sick of rejection emails. Many have taken to social media to share the misery of the job hunt with the growing mass of erstwhile tech workers. "I'm looking to move on from tech," commented one Reddit account on a thread about layoffs. "I am burned out on the lengthy interview process and then the rejections. It has done some damage to me physiologically." Another posted "lessons learned from my tech layoff," saying "I did not know who I was after I got laid off. I looked at myself in the mirror and I could not introduce myself to me. I regret caring so much about 'shareholder value.'" Unfortunately for American tech workers, the layoff train isn't slowing down. Yesterday, Meta kicked off "thousands of layoffs," amounting to roughly 5 percent of its staff, some of whom CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to replace with AI systems. And last week, Google offered workers severance in exchange for taking a voluntary layoff, signaling its intention to clamp down on its already consolidated hardware department, which had experienced hundreds of layoffs in spring of last year. While layoffs are becoming ubiquitous to all layers of tech, they're particularly insidious coming from the magnificent seven — stock-trader parlance for the tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta — which together are worth more than the stock markets of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France combined, or more than China's entire stock market, which is the second largest in the history of the world. Put it all together, and an industry that was just recently on top of the world is feeling some serious crunch. And while it's currently the rank-and-file taking the brunt, it remains to be seen how deep the cuts will go — especially because the tech sector, for now, seems hell-bent on pouring money into artificial intelligence.

Title: Republicans Fine With Leopards Eating Their Constituents' Faces First

Time Published: 2025-02-13T15:03:26Z

If there’s one thing that’s sacred to your free-enterprise capitalist types, it’s a contract between a buyer and a seller, or a borrower and a lender. You make a commitment to sell widgets, you’d better deliver those widgets, and if not, you will be banished from Libertarian Eden and condemned to peddle inferior socialist widgets in Latvia in 1955. That’s how we remember the excitable free enterprise Young Republicans in college at least, when they weren’t trying to bludgeon us with a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Of course, if the party making a contract was Joe Biden’s federal government, and that agreement was a loan for building an EV battery factory, well then the private companies, workers, and suppliers who thought those contracts were binding should have known better than to make any plans, especially not after Donald Trump was elected in November. America HATES the environment now, anyway. As The New York Times reports (gift link), that may come as a really unpleasant surprise to many in the red states that Trump relied on to win election, because now he’s decided to illegally block federal spending on anything related to clean energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, or people and geographic locations with the word “green” in their names. And as Yr Wonkette pointed out several times while Trump was preparing … OK, waiting, at least — to take office, a whole heck of a lot of the clean energy and manufacturing money from Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act ended up going to companies in red states. About 80 percent of it, as a recent analysis determined. Update: Just a reminder that this wasn’t by design: The tax incentives for manufacturers were agnostic as to location, and the siting location was up to the companies that took the deals. The south has cheaper labor because because of “right to work” (with no rights), so that was a big factor, as were other state-level incentives aimed at attracting bidniss. Now, when we pointed that out shortly after the election, back in our callow youth, we naively thought that, as with Pentagon contracts that send a little bit of every weapons system’s components to the home districts of key Congress members’ districts, that widely distributed IRA funding might mean support for keeping the legislation going. After all, local and federal electeds, and the companies getting the tax credits, would lobby hard to keep the money and jobs flowing. Thing is, even if those interests do want that to happen, Trump and Musk instead decided to bypass the Constitution and have Elon run the federal government. Boy, did we ever blow that guess! Wonkette sometimes gets it wrong because even our boundless cynicism can’t keep up. You should support us anyway! But even if red states haven’t squawked about it much, they’re definitely feeling the pinch. Since the IRA passed in 2022, private companies chasing the law’s tax breaks have announced plans to spend $165.8 billion to build factories that make solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and more, according to new data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm. On top of the tax incentives, the IRA and the earlier Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been the sources for tens of billions of dollars in grant money to businesses, state and local governments, and nonprofits. Those grants aren’t just a free bucket of money, they’re binding contracts that have spurred investments, led companies to buy land, hire people, and contract for services, all based on the contractual obligation that the government would reimburse them. That was the deal, right there on paper or PDF, probably both. Now, along comes Trump: Since the federal spending freeze was announced January 27, federal courts have placed a hold on it, several times in fact. The most recent decision came Tuesday when an appeals court denied the administration’s request to pretty please let Trump withhold billions and billions of dollars in grants and congressional allocations. That hasn’t actually resulted in any of the funds being restored, however, and that’s been leading to layoffs and furloughs and smaller contractors closing up shop, far beyond the clean energy and tech fields we’re talking about in our story here. For red parts of the country, the freeze on energy and climate spending is already taking a toll, per the Times: In Montana, a biofuels plant did not receive on time a $782 million payment it was owed, the first part of a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee. In Georgia, $1 billion in projects to modernize the power grid are on hold. In Nevada, a half-dozen large solar projects on federal lands are caught in a permitting freeze That’s also going to mean trouble for clean manufacturing companies set to open in 2025, valued at roughly $30 billion. While some already faced delays or even cancellation due to factors other than the Trump freeze, the funding cutoff will kill a lot more if it remains in place. Here’s one such example that the Times didn’t cover: EV maker Rivian paused construction of a planned battery and EV factory in Georgia last year due to uncertainty about the market for its nifty electric pickups, SUVs, and those bulbous electric Amazon delivery vans. Business has since picked up, and in January, Rivian announced the factory was back on schedule, thanks to a new $6.6 billion loan from the US Department under the IRA. Hooray! Jobs! Prosperity! A factory to build the company’s new, more affordable (but let’s be honest, still luxury-market) R2 and R3 midsized models! And then, right on the tail of the happy news, the spending freeze slammed down. So far, Rivian hasn’t commented on whether its loan specifically was affected, but the timing of the loan and subsequent freeze certainly suggests Rivian will be feel the chill. Democrats are already sounding the alarm and fighting for clean energy investment to go forward even if it is happening outside their districts, because it’s good for America and the planet. And Republicans are being Republicans. Here’s how Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) bravely defended the $415 million in federal funding for his district, some of which will create 650 new jobs in an auto parts plant, but only if the plant opens: “There might be some things in there that are worth saving,” Ruli admits, possibly looking around furtively for one of Elon’s Dogboys. “That’s going to take a little time to figure out.” And then there are the Republicans who are delighted to see their constituents screwed, although they don’t say that openly; they just deflect. Rep. Rick Allen, whose Georgia district has seen $1.6 billion in private investments driven by the IRA, grumbled — with zero evidence of course — that maybe the federal grant process under Biden was improper, and shouldn’t we all be overjoyed that now everything is on hold, just to be sure? No, he didn’t have any proof, but it was Biden, it had to be corrupt. Binding contracts? Free enterprise? Well not if the contracts were corrupt! No, stop asking me for proof, I’m just asking questions. Please go bother a Democrat now We were amused that the Times says the freeze has put Republicans in a “tricky position” where they must defend Trump at all costs (must they?), even as they’re “working behind the scenes to protect their towns from the loss of new manufacturing jobs.” Not that any Republicans the Times talked to would go on the record and admit they’re making such “behind the scenes” efforts, of course. Instead, the accounts of quiet moves to protect jobs in Republican districts came from clean energy industry lobbyists who have been meeting with those politician, and say the Republicans definitely know how bad ending federal clean energy spending will by for their districts. One lobbyist, Bob Keefe of the nonpartisan business group E2, told the Times, “We just met with more than a dozen key Republican offices, and I can tell you nobody wants to kill jobs. They don’t want to have to go back and face constituents and tell them that the factory I just cut the ribbon on might not be coming. That’s going to put them in a hard place.” Just don’t say who those Republicans are, please, OK?

Just added an update pointing out that the IRA tax incentives weren't designed or directed to go to red states; the incentives were agnostic on location, but companies building factories tended to site in red states because of lower ("right to work" with no rights) labor costs and other factors. By illegally bypassing Congress altogether, Trump might save Republicans the trouble of voting to kill jobs in their districts. Wasn't that nice of him? And all it takes is a constitutional crisis!

Title: The State Of DEI: Practitioners Navigate A Shifting Landscape

Big group of people holding hands together making round circle shape. Colorful diverse friend team ... [+] concept, united community or social cooperation cartoon on isolated background. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey showed that for “a majority of employed U.S. adults (56%), focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing,” with women, people of color and other demographic groups with marginalized identities voting in favor of DEI in higher numbers. In less than a month, despite broad public interest in DEI, President Trump has put an end to federal government spending on any efforts that seek to level the playing field for marginalized groups. A mandate that has been taken up by private sector companies, with little protest. Missing from the conversation on the federal government’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and rapid rollback of DEI among some of the world’s most visible companies is the impact on people who have championed workplace equity. DEI practitioners across the country are grappling with an uncertain future. Kim Flanery-Rye, founder of Inclusion Equals, had anticipated the shift and worked with clients in advance to prepare. "We discussed what their commitment to DEI would look like in different scenarios and how to prepare for potential impacts. We were already seeing the shifts in higher education, so the writing was on the wall. This wasn’t just theoretical; it was happening in real-time." And yet, despite data on the shifting landscape, practitioners feel gutted. "It's painful to see some of the work you and colleagues have done seemingly undone overnight," says Katrina Jones, a senior people and culture leader. For many DEI consultants, the impact has been both financial and deeply personal. "Many of our clients are pausing their DEI efforts" shares Sari De, founder of Nine of Us. "A few, who either are government bodies or who have major government contracts, have broken contracts with us, citing the executive order." Lindsey T.H. Jackson, a Seattle based consultant, echoes these concerns: "Over the past two weeks we have seen many RFPs and leads suddenly disappear. We have also had a handful of clients come to us to abruptly stop their work." For practitioners who are people of color, immigrants, or members of marginalized communities, the chilling effect of these policies extends beyond financial setbacks—it becomes a personal safety issue. De candidly shares, “I am a person of color, a woman, and an immigrant. I'm worried my work will put my citizenship in jeopardy, and I am carrying my US government ID (along with my foreign passport) with me at all times—the grocery store, the school pick-up.” The heightened fear of legal persecution is leading many to reassess their personal and professional choices, weighing risk against commitment to the work. For Flanery-Rye, the past few weeks have been a whirlwind. "I was overseas at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when the inauguration and the flurry of executive orders came through. Personally, as a DEI and culture practitioner, a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and a naturalized citizen through adoption, the announcements were confusing, terrifying, and gut-wrenching." The executive orders have left many organizations scrambling, uncertain of the legal and financial risks associated with running programs that prioritize women, queer and trans, and BIPOC employees. Language that was seen as bold, fair, inclusive, is now seen as legally risky communication. Many, especially Fortune 500 companies had been silently retreating over the past year, strategically dismissing employees with DEI titles. While layoffs are often attributed to business needs, many practitioners see a troubling pattern emerging as DEI positions are disproportionately affected. Last year, Microsoft laid off a DEI team, noting DEI was 'no longer business critical', along Meta, Amazon, dozens of non-tech companies, according to Fast Company. While some have chosen to quietly pull back newly made DEI commitments, others are doubling down. “The clients that are doubling down on DEI are actually increasing spending this year, continuing to support their ERGs and reassuring their employees that they will continue to speak up for their rights,” De explains. Jackson sees a similar pattern. “The vast majority of our clients have reached out to assure us that they will fight for their people,” she says. For those wondering how to support DEI efforts in this precarious climate, practitioners offer a clear message: action is needed. “More Upstanders, less Bystanders,” De asserts. “I want folks to feel comfortable getting their phones out when they see ICE detaining folks. I want people to feel like they can question officers when they board public transport or show up at school.” Allies have a role to play. "The ask is almost always the same," says Jones. "I'd like people to speak up, to speak out, to make noise, and join others to find a way forward." Flanery-Rye underscores the importance of economic and social support. "If you have economic power, put your money where it can have the biggest impact. If you have flexible time, use it to volunteer in your local community. If you have a public platform or social influence, use it to amplify voices." Allyship needs to come from leaders with influence on a national and global stage. DEI is more than anti-bias training and employee resource groups. In Assembly Required, David Glasglow, of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and Stacey Abrams us that DEI includes: A practioner anonymously shared that the field needs a clearer articulation of its value. "As a movement, we must do better to articulate what anti-bias work is all about and whom it serves. I have talked to many executives recently who are looking for language – when I start talking about DEI as supporting those with disabilities, or veterans, they seem shocked. We must do a better job articulating the full scope of this work." Despite the current challenges, practitioners are resolute in their belief that DEI will not disappear—it will evolve. "DEI won’t be erased, but for it to survive, it must evolve," says Flanery-Rye. "The real challenge is finding better ways to connect. It’s about making DEI real and relevant, rooted in lived experiences, backed by data, and communicated through compelling storytelling." DEI practitioners are facing one of the most challenging periods in recent memory, but their resolve is unshaken. As Jones aptly puts it, "This moment has also called out the need to frame the work clearly and pointedly so people understand it. That's an opportunity for evolution, which diversity, equity, and inclusion—and the people who lead this work—are more than capable of." The work will continue, shaped by those who refuse to be silenced. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Tech companies laying off staff are still hiring — especially in AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-hiring-job-openings-ai-cloud-infrastructure-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-12T19:03:29Z

Just because you've read about a tech company doing layoffs doesn't mean the company isn't continuing to hire. The first two months of the year have already seen many tech firms conduct or announce layoffs. While some may be looking to operate more efficiently, many have hundreds or thousands of open job listings. Backfilling the roles of laid-off employees or hiring more staff in divisions deemed a higher priority could build back head count levels in the coming year. In some cases, companies plan to grow their head count in the coming year, and one red-hot area many companies are bolstering hiring is AI, for example, and related divisions such as infrastructure and cloud computing. Here's a look at some tech companies that are still adding staff to their payroll amid layoffs. The workplace management platform is laying off 1,750 employees, or 8.5% of its workforce. CEO Carl Eschenbach told staffers in a memo he published that the company would "continue to hire in key strategic areas and locations" throughout fiscal year 2026. Workday is "prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board," he wrote. Workday has 348 job openings on its website as of this writing. Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce, targeting employees it says are low performers, with plans to backfill those roles later this year. The company is planning to hire "in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance," it said in its Q4 earnings last month. Meta appears to be accelerating hiring for machine learning engineers amid its layoffs, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Meta has 1,750 job openings on its website as of this writing. Stripe has laid off 300 workers, primarily in product, engineering, and operations roles. The cuts represent roughly 3.5% of the payment platform's workforce. However, the company's chief people officer, Rob McIntosh, said in a memo to staff that Stripe is "not slowing down hiring." Stripe plans to boost its head count to roughly 10,000 employees by the end of 2025, which would be a 17% increase year-over-year, he wrote. Stripe has several hundred job openings on its website as of this writing. Salesforce is reportedly laying off 1,000 people, who will be able to apply for other positions internally, Bloomberg reported this month. The company has not publicly commented on the matter and did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in December that the company plans to hire 2,000 salespeople focused on selling its AI products. Salesforce has 995 job openings on its website as of this writing. Microsoft began performance-based layoffs at the end of January. Separate from the performance-based layoffs, the tech giant also made cuts across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, BI previously reported. Microsoft has 2,128 job openings on its website as of this writing. Layoffs can result in a domino effect in the tech industry — look no further than Mark Zuckerberg's famous "year of efficiency" or the CEOs inspired by Elon Musk's deep cuts when taking over Twitter. If that's also the case this time around, we could see other Big Tech companies carry out their own layoffs. At Amazon, for one, CEO Andy Jassy said last year that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Google recently offered voluntary exit packages to US staff in its Platforms and Devices unit. Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of Google parent company Alphabet, said in October that the company would be looking for "additional opportunities" for cost cuts. Google simultaneously expects "some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud." And while Amazon and Google haven't laid out more explicit plans to ramp up hiring in AI, you can bet they're going to duke it out with their Big Tech peers in the heated AI talent wars. Big Tech firms have also made no secret of their ambitious spending plans when it comes to AI. Recent earnings from Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google indicate their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion this year, driven largely by AI investments. Jump to

A record number of Americans missed work on Monday following the Philadelphia Eagles' win over the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 59. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) Are you getting over a *cough cough* cold today? If so, you’re one of the 22.6 million U.S. employees who were planning to miss work the Monday after the Super Bowl, a 40% increase from last year, according to The Harris Poll data from UKG. That number includes folks who planned to call in sick––even if they aren’t actually ill––as well as those who planned to “ghost” their employer by skipping work and not telling them. Some have pre-planned their absence, with 12.9 million taking PTO and 4.8 million swapping shifts with coworkers. Even then, an additional 12.9 million said they would be late to work on Monday. Talk about last-minute play calls. For those who did show up to work, productivity may have been down to start the week. The poll found that about 40% of those who watched the game and went to work would be distracted by media coverage of the game on Monday, up from 28% last year. While the scale of these absences is record-breaking, the phenomenon isn’t new. About 43% of employed Americans believe the Monday after the Super Bowl should be a national holiday. Indiana is even taking steps to enshrine that idea into law: A bill was introduced in the state’s legislature last week that would make the day a state holiday. The number of workers calling out sick on Monday wasn’t the only record broken during the Super Bowl: While the Kansas City Chiefs failed to beat the Philadelphia Eagles to secure a three-peat, the game was the most-watched matchup in Super Bowl history. Fox garnered 126 million viewers across platforms, including its free streaming service Tubi. Happy reading, and hope you all have a lovely week!

Deep Dive: Employee Confidence Starts The Year On A Sour Note Employee confidence on their employer's business outlook has fallen to a February 2024 low, driven by economic fears and a new presidential administration. One month into 2025 and employees are not confident in the business outlook for their employers, according to a new Glassdoor report. Layoffs, economic fears and a new presidential administration are to blame. It’s a new year and employee confidence is once again going down. According to Glassdoor’s employee confidence index, which measures workers’ ratings of their employer’s six-month business outlook (either positive, negative or neutral), only 45.1% of U.S. employees have a positive view on their employer’s future. That’s the lowest percentage since last February, when the index hit its lowest since Glassdoor began tracking it in 2016. The weak sentiment comes on the heels of January’s jobs report that saw 143,000 non-farm jobs get added to the economy, lower than analyst expectations. It’s part of the reason as to why sentiment is low––economic anxieties, which rose in January, and news of layoffs have rattled workers. Those working in government and public administration positions lost the most confidence, according to Glassdoor, falling 2.8 percentage points compared to December. The legality of various Trump Administration policies affecting federal workers, including buyout offers, funding cuts and the effective closure of entire agencies like USAID, have made federal workers uneasy about their future. Full return-to-office plans and funding for state offices has also been put into question. That’s without counting the impact on federal contractors who’ve had their contracts and funding frozen, if not cut completely. Other industries, however, have seen an increase in confidence compared to last year. Insurance saw the biggest gain during a month filled with news of natural disasters and subsequent coverage questions. Aerospace and defense also saw a 5% increase in confidence from last year. Employee confidence levels also tend to differ based on seniority. Mid-level employees continue to feel the most anxious about the future and experienced the largest drop-off in confidence compared to other seniority levels, according to the data. In efforts to reduce costs and flatten out organizations, middle managers are often the first on the chopping block. News from the world of work “Financial loyalty at VC firms has never been weaker,” an endowment leader recently told Forbes. It’s part of a larger movement of venture capital partners leaving blue-chip firms (think Lightspeed, Sequoia and a16z) to start their own funds. Meet venture’s new guard. The U.S. added 143,000 non-farm jobs in January, lower than analysts estimated and the weakest January total since 2016. Unemployment, however, topped expectations, though January did mark the ninth-consecutive month of at least 4% unemployment. These numbers are more of an indicator of the job market President Trump is inheriting, rather than any impact he’s had on it thus far. While at least 65,000 federal workers have accepted the “deferred resignation” offer from the new administration, the deadline was again paused by a federal judge on Monday until the president “responds” to the issues at the heart of the several lawsuits brought on by federal workers unions. Google is the latest major employer to roll back its DEI initiatives. On Wednesday, the company said it would remove all of its diversity hiring targets, before removing cultural observances like Pride Month and Black History Month from Google Calendar. All in all, over a dozen major companies have pared back or removed references to DEI in their 2024 annual reports. Amazon employees are increasingly worried about their career trajectories as the company flattens middle management roles in an effort to cut costs, according to Bloomberg. Those looking to climb the corporate ladder have been told to consider “horizontal development,” in other words, acquiring different skills with no promotion. Are workplace feuds the new trend for increased PR? Billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been squabbling it out in the media over the funding to President Trump’s Stargate program. While their supposed feud dates back to 2015, when both Altman and Musk were among the cofounders of OpenAI, the public comments picked up again this year. Meanwhile, Super Bowl halftime performer Kendrick Lamar’s feud with Drake not only took center stage on Sunday, but has also won the rapper multiple Grammy Awards.

Title: Do Our Courses Need An Update To Reflect The Workings Of Information Businesses?

1936: British actor and director Charles Chaplin (1889 - 1977), wearing overalls and holding a ... [+] wrench, sits on an enormous set of gears in a still from Chaplin's film, 'Modern Times'. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Syllabi at management schools and senior management at perhaps many businesses don’t fully appreciate how information businesses work. I was chatting with a successful Silicon Valley venture capitalist last week about how we may have under-invested in understanding the impact of technology on our economy. The VC suggested, “macroeconomic modeling generally treats technology as an external parameter like Total Factor Productivity, rather than as an endogenously determined, explicitly engineered system. As a result, conventional models struggle to address the most critical structural issues facing the U.S. and global economy. They neither integrate short-run dynamics with long-run growth considerations nor capture how digital technologies — AI, 5G, robotics, 3D printing, zero-cost digital services — are developed, diffused, and shaped by policy and market forces. This limitation leaves unexplored how these technologies affect productivity, output, time use, education, skill requirements, and well-being.” The VC sounds more professorial than me but I am not a macro-economist and hence say much about the above statement. However, I suspect the same sentiment applies at the micro level to technology companies or information businesses, more broadly. I suspect that we have not updated our syllabi and course offerings at management schools as much as we should have, after the U.S. lost its crown as a manufacturing powerhouse. I compared the list of course offerings in say 1998 when I started teaching with what is offered today by top business schools. I found a few changes but nothing radical seems to have been restructured. So, what was taught in 1998 and to a great extent today? I conjecture we mostly teach management insights, as practiced in the manufacturing era. There was a fair degree of excitement about management theories as applied to manufacturing processes back in the day. I am thinking of Fredrick Taylor’s scientific management theories, the Hawthorne experiments, the Japanese ideas of Total Quality Management, lean manufacturing, and GE’s six sigma mindset. None of these ideas, perhaps formulated explicitly for the manufacturing age, fully apply or explain how information companies operate. Consider a summary of these ideas and how these apply or not to the modern information giants: Frederick Taylor is widely recognized for “time and motion” studies conducted in the 1880s where he observed the specific steps a worker takes to lay bricks and the time it takes to go through these steps. The idea is to optimize the number of steps and time taken to accomplish the task. More broadly, Taylor is known for two big ideas: (i) scientific management, based on evidence and observation, as opposed to gut feel and rules of thumb; and (ii) the conflict between management and labor is somewhat unnecessary as both parties would benefit with better productivity which would manifest as higher wages and higher profits. Taylor emphasized standardized tools and procedures. He wanted managers to set specified goals and assign tasks to workers to motivate workers to perform better. He argued that workers should be paid a bonus of 30% to 100% of wages for learning to do the job as per the principles of scientific management. Taylor also advocated individual work and productivity and was somewhat skeptical of group work. Taylor suggested choosing the worker with the right aptitude as such a worker would be far more productive than the average worker. He also pushed for rest pauses and shorter working hours, especially if the task is hard. Taylorism is perhaps the precursor to a lot of what is taught in operations research, human relations and cost accounting courses in B schools. I suspect Amazon relied on time and motion studies to understand how to optimize packing boxes in their distribution centers. The idea of choosing the right worker with aptitude for the job is an established tenet in HR (Human Relations) groups all over the world. The Hawthorne studies are credited with recognizing the influence of human relations or social factors in motivating workers. The Hawthorne researchers found the workers’ response to a managerial intervention is a function of the attitudes the workers bring to their job, the informal work group they belong to, their personal history and their social situation at work. Worker culture in big tech companies is widely discussed. Netflix’s culture deck, which potentially owes its inspiration to the early Hawthorne studies, is legendary in Bay area circles. The deck emphasizes the freedom to excel, deciding which worker is a keeper and paying them a premium over their market wage, the idea that the best workers are 10X better than average, and that teams ought to be highly aligned in their goals but only loosely coupled to stay nimble. The Total Quality Management way of thinking aims to make quality the concern of every member of the firm. Customers are the focus of all activities of the firm and improvements in quality are directed at improving customer satisfaction. Such a focus is expected to lead to better financial performance in two ways: (i) in the manufacturing process, we are expected to encounter fewer defects and rework leading to lower costs and more dependable processes and hence better earnings; and (ii) in the product market, more focus on quality is expected to lead to higher market share, less elastic demand, higher prices and hence higher earnings. The idea of lean manufacturing, a related concept, is to deliver a quality product to the customer at a reasonable cost. Incidentally, Trevor Harris, my co-author and emeritus professor at Columbia Business School, tells me that Edward Deming, another CBS professor, pioneered the thinking behind TQM and even the Six-Sigma movement. I don’t know whether Tesla follows TQM and lean manufacturing but I did come across a help wanted ad from Tesla looking for a quality engineer whose job description sounded similar to what a TQM engineer would do. In a 1997 annual letter Jack Welch sent to GE stockholders, he explains: "Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations….The Six Sigma quality initiative, very briefly, means going from approximately 35,000 defects per million operations, which is average for most companies, including GE, to fewer than 4 defects per million in every element in every process that this company engages in every day.” Welch goes on to explain how Six Sigma works with the “A” leaders in each function of the company: “In finance, for example, “A’s” will be people whose talents include, but transcend, traditional controllership. The bigger role is one of full-fledged participant in driving the business to win in the marketplace — a role far bigger than the dreary and wasteful budget “drills” and bean counting that once defined and limited the job. In engineering, “A’s” are those who embrace the methodology of Design for Six Sigma. “A” engineers can’t stand the thought of “riding it out” in the lab, but rather relish the rapid pace of technological change and continually re-educate themselves to stay on top of it. In manufacturing, “A” players will be people who are immersed in Six Sigma technology, who consider inventory an embarrassment, especially with a whiff of deflation in the air — people who understand how to drive asset turns and reduce inventory while at the same time increasing our readiness to serve the customer. In sales, “A” players will use the enormous customer value that Six Sigma generates to differentiate GE from the competition, to find new accounts, and to refresh and expand the old ones — as contrasted with “C” players whose days are spent visiting “friends” on the “milk-run” circuit of customer calls.” Amazon reportedly relied on Six Sigma type ideas to reduce the error rate on their package delivery to minuscule levels considering that they processed 5.9 billion packages in 2023. As stated, modern information businesses, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Netflix, and Uber, rely on many of these ideas inspired by manufacturing. But these tech businesses also do not seem to fit the traditional mold of management theories well. In a seminal paper written around 2001, Hal Varian discusses ways in which the “new economy” information businesses are different from traditional manufacturing firms: Not quite. Let me start with my home field. Trevor Harris points out that statutory reporting, that is done once a quarter in a rigid regulation bound format, is a relic of a bygone era. Good businesses have a dashboard to track the key KPIs that matter for value creation. Why don’t we ask firms to disclose that dashboard on a more frequent cadence to investors? Of course, there are concerns about proprietary costs and so on, but I have not seen many creative conversations about how to leverage technology and/or better reflect the economics of technology and information businesses in our textbooks and syllabi. For another smaller illustration of this problem, our textbooks treat intangible assets in a somewhat rule-oriented framework. The FASB says X and not X. So, we explain that in the text but rarely take the conversation to the next level to consider how technology creates value. My co-authors and I have a few modest contributions in this area, generally lamenting how little information about value creation potential of technology spending is shared with the investing public and the absence of data to calculate unit economics or lifetime value of a customer but much more needs to be done. I have not seen a good treatment of how cost accounting should think about supply and demand side economies of scale, standards, systems effects and computer mediated transactions. A critic may argue that the basics of cost accounting have not changed. But one must wonder whether the field is stuck around the time manufacturing left the U.S. for Asia. Have we updated thinking in cost accounting for the bundled information products, why some of Amazon’s divisions are never supposed to make money (free shipping, Kindle) so that they can cross-sell other products in the retail store, how does Amazon price the time of developers working on features and software products or how does a firm value its data or the data acquired in an M&A transaction? What kind of cost data does an Amazon, or an Uber collect? Do they conduct cost-volume-profit analyses to determine breakeven sales quantity for a product, given the extent of bundling and portfolio type thinking necessary to accomplish this? How does Amazon calculate the lifetime value of a customer? How is common overhead across segments and how did that practice potentially fund Amazon’s internal capital markets such as books leading to video to music to third party selling to AWS? How does one think about budgeting and sales and cost variances for a modern tech business? A related problem in finance has been the persistent puzzle on how to value intangibles. Absence of even modest accounting data to perform such valuations is a big hindrance. Do frameworks such as real options plausibly explain the valuations of a Tesla or an Amazon or an Nvidia? How does one stress test or falsify these black box valuations? Have the low-interest rate environments, coincidental with the rise of Big Tech, defaulted us to faith-based valuations? How has corporate finance changed with the rise of information businesses? Is capital less of a constraint than skilled labor? How does one come up with capital budgeting for information products or bundled systems? How has cash and liquidity management changed? Has big data and AI improved scenario planning and hence enabled better capital allocation? Has granular data made it easier to dissect why some acquisitions succeeded while others failed? Now, I stray into areas that are not my own and hence rely on observation, as opposed to deep analysis. Marketing and Operations Research are arguably the two disciplines in a B school that have adapted and embraced the practices of Big Tech firms better than other units. There are tons of classes on digital marketing, social influencers, ad platforms, AI offered by these two groups. Human Relations: Jensen Huang’ statement illustrates the profound change that HR groups are/will experience in the near future: “In a lot of ways, the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future.” That is, the IT departments of the future will train and “onboard” AI agents as though these were employees to ensure that such agents work to enhance human workers’ productivity. Recruiting is already mediated by AI algorithms, for better or for worse. Work from home, enabled by technology, is not going away. This is already creating profound challenges on how to integrate younger workers into a company. Many of these workers were hired on a zoom call and will potentially not get promoted by senior leaders who don’t know them as individuals or human beings. Ironically, I would suggest that we need to invest more in traditional HR. Do our newer leaders have the training and outlook to look a worker in the eye and say to them in a respectful way that they are being laid off? If they did, we would not come across so many cases of mass layoffs via email or zoom. Our slowness, in the B school, to adapt and teach management practices of Big Tech or enabled by technology in general, would be less of a concern if these considerations only mattered to a handful of tech giants. But that is certainly not the case. I routinely come across senior managers of companies that are both enthusiastically and reluctantly digitizing without fully understanding the profound change that Varian’s forces will have on their firms. This is not to say that people have not worked on documenting management practices at Amazon or the other technology firms. I have not seen a book or a manual or a coherent framework that one can hand to future managers of non-digital firms to prepare for a digital/tech leavy/information dense tomorrow.

Title: The impact of Trump's tariffs is already being felt

Hello there! Business Insider saw a list of nearly 30 staffers at the White House DOGE office. The group, which is helping Elon Musk embark on a massive reshaping of the federal government, consists of mostly early and mid-career professionals. In today's big story, new tariff plans spell trouble for Canada while the trade war is already impacting influencer marketing. What's on deck Markets: The consultants and podcasters trying to demystify how the world's largest hedge funds are run. Tech: Meta's performance-based cuts don't mean it's done hiring. Business: President Trump's buyout plan for federal workers is still on pause. But first, more trade trouble. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Another day. Another tariff. President Donald Trump is targeting steel and aluminum with his latest tariff plans, enacting a 25% tax on the metal imports. That's set to have a big impact on Canada, a top supplier of both steel and aluminum to the US, writes Business Insider's Allie Kelly and Madison Hoff. Mexico, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, and China are also big metal exporters to the US. What's bad for our trading partners is good for some American companies. Before the tariffs were even official, shares of US Steel still jumped as much as 6% on Monday. The trade taxes are a double win for local steel producers, writes Matthew Fox, as it will limit foreign companies' ability to flood the US market with lower-priced steel while also giving them the flexibility to raise their prices. Investors in gold have also been big winners, as precious metals could be hit with tariffs next. More broadly, gold has been viewed as a safe haven amid constant uncertainty over the threat of new tariffs. The impact of tariffs is already being felt in another corner of the economy. Some fashion brands are pausing influencer campaigns and blaming it on US tariffs, write BI's Amanda Perelli, Dan Whateley, and Geoff Weiss. Halara and Shein are pausing some campaigns as they assess what the tariffs will mean for their businesses. It's yet another blow to an industry grappling with the threat of a TikTok ban. But it's also far from the only market facing tariff-related headaches. If things escalate to the point where countries implement retaliatory tariffs on the US, S&P 500 firms could see an 8% hit to their earnings, according to Bank of America. A lot of the concerns over tariffs remain speculative, though. And some have long dismissed Trump's trade plans as a negotiation tactic to obtain better trading terms. But even if that's the case, the uncertainty surrounding what will and won't happen continues to cause problems. Nike had the buzziest Super Bowl ad on social media, data shows. 1. Sorry, coffee drinkers. Your morning cup of joe might start costing more. Eggs aren't the only breakfast staple under pressure. Coffee prices are expected to climb this year thanks to supply snags that could exacerbate the shortage of beans, BofA analysts said. Last week, Arabica coffee prices closed at an all-time high of $4.04 per pound — and analysts said they expect coffee retail prices to keep going up. 2. Video game stocks are looking to notch a new high score. Pent-up demand for long-awaited releases like Grand Theft Auto 6 and the Nintendo Switch 2 is boosting video game companies' shares. The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF is up 12% this year, far outstripping the S&P 500's 3% year-to-date return. 3. Demystifying big-name hedge funds. Former portfolio managers are launching podcasts, Substacks, and consulting firms to assist with talent development and offer an inside look at top funds like Citadel and Point72. These voices also give prospective PMs and analysts a reality check on what it really takes to succeed at those companies. (Hint: It's a lot of hard work.) 1. Meta speeds up hiring despite layoffs. As the social media giant slashes thousands of low performers from its workforce, Meta is also expediting its hiring process for engineers. It's specifically focused on machine-learning, according to an internal memo. 2. AI is Gen Z's work buddy. A growing number of Gen Z workers leverage AI at the office, from drafting emails to conducting research. While AI's proponents say it can free up their time to focus on higher-level responsibilities, others caution against relying too heavily on the technology. Still, older workers need to keep pace. 3. The Elon Musk v. Sam Altman feud continues. Musk and a group of investors submitted an unsolicited offer to buy "all assets" of OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. "It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk wrote. Altman quickly dismissed the offer, leading to a back-and-forth exchange between the two on X. 1. Former federal workers for hire … but not too many yet. As a judge continues to pause the federal worker buyout plan, economists are weighing in on what the resignations could mean for the labor market. So far, the number of people who accepted the offer is relatively low, and many may plan to retire anyway. But things could heat up further as federal funding tightens. 2. How Fox is (sort of) getting back with its exes. YouTube isn't the only media company betting on podcasts. Fox Corp. bought Red Seat Ventures, a podcasting company that happens to handle production and ad sales for former Fox News stars Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. BI's Peter Kafka breaks down the move. 3. TikTok Shop challenges Amazon with its new subscription feature. In the latest move to compete with its e-commerce peers, TikTok Shop is testing a subscription feature, similar to Amazon's subscribe-and-save tool, that would allow users to repeatedly receive products in exchange for a discount. The feature would help sellers lock in recurring revenue and manage shipment amid sale surges from viral videos. Amazon has more than 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment centers. Here are some of the things they can do. Senate Finance Committee hearing on Donald Trump's nominee for US trade representative.
