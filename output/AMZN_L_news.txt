Democrats have paid a political price for taking on Silicon Valley — but not a very expensive one. by Eric Levitz In January 2017, Sergey Brin rallied beside progressive activists at San Francisco International Airport to protest Donald Trump’s travel ban. Eight years later, the Google co-founder sat with right-wing nationalists at Trump’s second inauguration. Brin is far from the only tech mogul who has (apparently) warmed to Trump in recent years. Mark Zuckerberg once bankrolled liberal causes. Now, the Facebook founder dines with America’s favorite insurrectionist at Mar-a-Lago. In 2016, Marc Andreessen argued that Hillary Clinton was the “obvious choice” for president, and that any proposal to choke off immigration “makes me sick to my stomach.” Last year, Andreessen endorsed Trump. And, of course, Elon Musk has gone from being an Obama-supporting climate hawk to quite possibly the single most influential advocate for — and patron of — far-right politics in the United States. The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. Silicon Valley’s apparent rightward shift was already causing consternation in blue America last year. But Democrats’ outrage and anxiety over the red-pilling of Silicon Valley has only increased since Inauguration Day — when Brin, Zuckerberg, Musk, Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook all sat with Trump’s camp in the Capitol Rotunda. Some Democrats view Big Tech’s rightward lurch as a political crisis, one brought on by their own party’s policy mistakes. In this account, Democrats needlessly alienated a powerful industry by embracing an anti-corporate economic agenda that is both politically costly and substantively misguided. Others in the party, meanwhile, insist that the Biden administration’s attempts to tame Big Tech’s power were both good politics and good policy. In their telling, voters hate corporate monopolies and love antitrust enforcement. And the extraordinary wealth and power of large tech companies constitute a threat to democratic government — a reality that Silicon Valley’s present chumminess with Trump only underscores. From this vantage, the tech industry’s interests and the general public’s were always irreconcilable. And as Silicon Valley grew wealthier, it was bound to gravitate toward America’s more pro-business party. The Biden administration’s error, therefore, was not doing too much to antagonize Big Tech, but too little. This debate collapses together several distinct questions. Some of these are ideological — such as whether the Biden administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement was worthwhile on the merits. Today though, I want to focus on two factual questions at the center of the intra-Democratic dispute over Big Tech: I think the answers to both these questions are more complicated than either progressive or pro-business Democrats allow. To understand why Silicon Valley has moved right in recent years, it’s helpful to consider what had previously tethered the industry to the center-left. Many in the tech world argue that Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party were long bound by an implicit “deal”: Democrats would support the development of new technology, celebrate entrepreneurs, and take a light touch approach to regulating the digital sphere — in exchange for tech moguls backing socially liberal causes, progressive taxation, incremental expansions of the welfare state, philanthropies, and Democratic candidates. This was a pretty good bargain for the typical tech founder — since it effectively entailed the Democratic Party embracing nearly all of their preferences. Survey data on the views of Silicon Valley moguls is limited. But a 2017 study of tech entrepreneurs’ politics found that they were left-leaning on almost all issues — including taxation and redistribution — but quite right-wing on questions of government regulation and labor unions. This distinct ideological profile has been dubbed “liberal-tarian.” Given that Democrats have always been the party more supportive of regulating industry and promoting organized labor, the party’s alliance with tech was long fraught with some tension. But in recent years, both sides began souring on their supposed contract for a variety of reasons. But three were especially significant: When an industry is enjoying explosive growth, it has less incentive to align with the right. Democrats might nibble into its profits with their relatively high taxes, or inch its compliance costs with their greater regulatory scrutiny. But when your sector is awash in cheap financing and soaring revenues, the price of allying with a left-of-center party can look negligible. As Andreessen put the point to the New York Times earlier this month, back in the days of Clinton and Obama, “the tax rates didn’t really matter because when an internet company worked, it grew so fast and got so valuable that if you worked another three years, say, you’d make another 10 X. Another 5 percent higher tax rate washed out in the numbers.” Silicon Valley enjoyed such favorable conditions for much of the 2010s. But the tech boom faded during Biden’s tenure. In 2022, rising interest rates started diverting capital away from the tech sector: With safe assets now offering an attractive guaranteed return, investors grew more reluctant to funnel cash into risky ones. Stock market valuations fell and layoffs spread. At the same time, as Noah Smith notes, tech investors and executives started running up against structural constraints on profit-making. Many venture capitalists looked at Google and Facebook’s success in cornering and dominating their respective markets, and bet that they could establish similarly monopolistic businesses in other corners of digital commerce. But by 2022, they’d discovered that achieving such market dominance was harder than they’d thought. Meanwhile, social media companies struggled to combat the inherently finite nature of human attention: Once you’ve lured roughly 5 billion humans onto social media — and turned a hefty percentage of them into addicts — there’s only so much screen time left to monetize. In this context, we would expect tech moguls who’d been only lightly committed to the “liberal” part of liberal-tarianism to start heeding their own narrow material interests. After all, it was a similar mix of rising interest rates, inflation, and slowing profitability that helped prompt corporate America’s right turn in the 1970s. To be sure, the tech industry’s fortunes have rebounded since 2022, thanks in no small part to the AI boom. But the experience of a capital crunch and profit squeeze — however temporary — seems to have made a lasting impression on many in tech, whose political contributions began shifting (modestly) toward Republicans in 2022. For the reasons above, it wouldn’t have been surprising for the tech industry to have drifted toward Republicans over the past four years, even if Democratic policy remained as friendly to tech as had it been under Barack Obama. In reality, the Biden administration took a much more adversarial stance than its predecessors. Biden’s Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department collectively brought antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft. This blitzkrieg of aggressive antitrust enforcement naturally irritated Silicon Valley’s giants. Perhaps less predictably, it also antagonized smaller tech firms and startups. In theory, one might expect “little tech” would want the government to curb the market power of their gargantuan competitors. In practice, however, many startup founders and investors aspire to either grow their own firms into behemoths, or failing that, get bought up by a larger company. By chilling merger activity, the Biden administration effectively blocked many startups’ “plan B,” while choking off a reliable source of returns for venture capitalists. VCs and startups also took exception to the Biden Securities and Exchange Commission’s vigorous regulation of cryptocurrency, as well as the administration’s executive order on AI safety. In November 2023, a contingent of startup founders and investors denounced the latter, arguing that the order’s reporting requirements put small AI firms at a competitive disadvantage, as they could less comfortably shoulder regulatory compliance costs than their larger rivals. Finally, Biden proposed a new tax on the unrealized capital gains of Americans with more than $100 million in wealth. This would mean that when a megamillionaire investor’s stock portfolio or real estate holdings gained $5 million in value, they would need to pay a tax on that amount, even if they did not sell those assets. Tax policy wonks like this idea. But super-rich tech investors very much do not. And when Kamala Harris announced her support for Biden’s plan last summer, Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists had a conniption. Super-rich tech moguls care about making money. But they are often at least as covetous of social status. Past a certain point, accumulating more wealth has little practical impact on your living standards (or those of your children, or your children’s children). But a person’s appetite for greater prestige tends to be less exhaustible than their desire for beach homes, Porsches, or private jets. Thus, if Democrats had spent the past decade exalting tech investors and founders, it’s possible that the party’s increasingly adversarial policies would have caused less rancor in Silicon Valley. But Democrats became increasingly disillusioned with the tech industry over the course of the 2010s. And this culminated in a Democratic administration that undermined tech billionaires’ sense of self-importance. “At the core level, both Barack Obama and the modal Democrat thought the average Silicon Valley company was really good and cool in 2009,” Marc Aidinoff, a historian and policy adviser in both the Obama and Biden administrations, told me. “Obama would go to Silicon Valley and have dinner with the CEOs and call them champions of change. What these people really wanted from the president was the sense that they were loved.” But by 2021, things had changed, according to Aidinoff. “Joe Biden distrusts these people, thinks they are hurting Americans, and has the sense that they aren’t actually making much of real value,” he said. The Democrats’ disenchantment with tech wasn’t attributable to Biden’s personal skepticism of Silicon Valley alone. After the financial crisis, the party’s progressive wing grew more influential. And its ascent increased the salience of both inequality and labor issues in Democratic politics. For a party increasingly concerned with wealth concentration and workers’ rights, tech giants that generated vast fortunes off “winner-take-all” markets — while, in many cases, committing labor violations or undermining traditional employment — did not look like engines of progress. As importantly, the notion that social media platforms promoted democracy and social reform fell into disrepute. In the wake of Obama’s election and the Arab Spring — both of which were widely credited to novel media technologies — many liberals bought into the idea that Facebook and Twitter would abet a more egalitarian politics. But authoritarian regimes proved adept at restricting online speech. And if social media’s potential to facilitate rightwing extremism wasn’t clear to liberals before 2016, it was apparent to them afterward. Following Trump’s victory, many Democrats blamed their party’s defeat on Facebook’s dissemination of “fake news.” Around the same time, research suggesting that social media could have adverse mental health effects started to accumulate. All this — combined with tech platforms’ adverse impact on traditional journalism — led the mainstream media to view Silicon Valley more critically. Between 2012 and 2019, the New York Times’ coverage of Facebook turned sharply negative, according to one prominent data analysis. Add in Silicon Valley’s growing enthusiasm for crypto — a technology that appeared to be good for little beyond scams and speculation — and it isn’t hard to see why Democrats soured on Big Tech. The party’s newfound skepticism of the industry didn’t just translate into greater regulatory scrutiny, but also, a withholding of both praise and access. According to some in tech, the sector’s leading lights felt themselves shunned and slighted by the Biden White House. “I think the fundamental problem, and I heard this from many, was that former President Biden was unwilling to meet with tech CEOs and entrepreneurs,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me. “It was that simple.” One former Biden official echoed this assessment, saying that tech companies “couldn’t get meetings with a lot of the key regulators. Certainly [FTC commissioner] Lina [Khan] wouldn’t meet with people — she liked to say, ‘We’re enforcement, you can’t really meet with us.’” Andreessen recently reminisced that Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party had “celebrated” and “loved” tech companies. Biden’s Democratic Party, by contrast, often refused Andreessen’s ilk the time of day. It’s clear then that Silicon Valley’s rightward turn was precipitated, at least in part, by a change in the Democratic Party’s attitudes and policies toward the tech industry. And there’s reason to think that the party’s anti-tech turn is politically costly on net. Were other tech billionaires to emulate Musk’s political giving — or other social media companies to imitate X’s boosting of right-wing content — the damage to Democrats could be considerable. And the Trump administration’s manifest openness to trading political power for financial support makes this a live possibility, especially if Democrats promise to reprise the Biden administration’s policies toward the industry. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that aggressively regulating Silicon Valley can gain Democrats meaningful support elsewhere. This is not because voters oppose that general goal: In fact, in a 2024 Pew Research poll, a slight majority expressed support for increasing regulation of the tech industry, while a supermajority said that social media has had a “mostly negative” effect on the United States. The problem is that voters have ambivalent feelings about Big Tech writ large, and do not consider regulating the companies a priority. When Gallup asked Americans what their country’s most important problem was this month, only 1 percent named “corporate corruption” while 0 percent picked “technology.” In a post-election survey from Morning Consult and the Chamber of Progress (a trade group of companies allied with the Democratic Party), voters were presented with a list of 12 issues, and asked to name the two that were most important to their vote. Only 2 percent of respondents picked “regulating technology companies” as one of their priorities, making it the single least prioritized objective on the list (by contrast, 49 percent selected “controlling inflation and strengthening the economy”). Meanwhile, in YouGov’s polling, Amazon’s approval rating sits at 74 percent, Google’s at 70 percent, Apple’s at 69 percent, and Facebook at 59 percent. Given all this, it’s plausible that Democrats have more to lose than gain politically from taking on Big Tech. Yet it’s also true that the political costs of the party’s anti-tech turn have been routinely overstated. In truth, Silicon Valley’s rightward shift — while real — has been remarkably modest, whether measured in votes or donations. In 2020, Biden won Santa Clara County, which includes much of Silicon Valley, by 48 points. Four years later, he won it by 40 points. There’s some evidence that tech workers and executives became more likely to donate to Republicans during the Biden era. But 83 percent of Amazon employees’ donations to federal candidates went to Democrats in 2024; for Meta, that figure was 91.5 percent; for Apple, it was 95 percent. At the megadonor level, the story is a bit more complicated. Trump received more money from tech donors who spent over $1 million on the 2024 race than Harris did — but that’s mostly thanks to Musk’s prodigious giving. Musk spent $242.6 million on the 2024 election, nearly five times as much as Silicon Valley’s second-largest political spender, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, a Democrat. And yet, it’s hard to attribute Musk’s political evolution to recent changes in Democratic policy. The Tesla CEO appears to have been undergoing a process of online radicalization even before Biden took office (in March 2020, Musk allegedly bet the writer Sam Harris $1 million that there would be fewer than 35,000 cases of Covid-19 in the United States, a conviction that seems symptomatic of his immersion in right-wing social media). If we deem Musk a special case and put him to the side, then Democrats retained their advantage with large tech donors in 2024: Combined, all other tech megadonors spent $30.6 million on Trump, and $120.9 million on Harris, according to an analysis from The Guardian. In any case, money was not the Democrats’ problem in 2024. The party and its allied groups outraised the GOP by $1.1 billion during last year’s campaign. To be sure, many Silicon Valley billionaires waited until after Election Day to cozy up to Trump, so their newfound support for the GOP would not be captured by this data. But those who only started currying Trump’s favor once he secured the presidency are likely motivated less by antipathy for Democratic policy than awareness of Republican corruption: Trump has made it quite clear that his friends can expect favorable treatment by his government while his foes can anticipate the opposite. “A number of people in tech led with vinegar during Trump’s first term and learned that it was better with Trump to lead with honey,” Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and chair of the Chamber of Progress, told me. “It’s not so much that they expect a lot, but they really don’t want their companies to be hurt by Trump. If your competitors are building a close relationship with Trump, you don’t want them to screw you.” All of which is to say: The Democrats have paid a price for their crusade against Big Tech, but not a prohibitively expensive one. None of this settles the debate over whether Democrats were right to take a more adversarial posture toward the tech industry under Biden. Moderate Democrats can look at this pattern of facts and conclude that Biden’s agenda alienated a powerful industry and did little to increase their party’s popular support, all while discouraging growth and innovation. Progressives, meanwhile, can counter that Democrats just proved they can take on concentrated corporate power and still retain an overwhelming financial advantage over the GOP — and thus, the party has no excuse not to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of tech billionaires. Ultimately though, the important disagreement here is the substantive one. If Democrats can ingratiate themselves to tech billionaires in ways that have little substantive cost — such as giving them face time or rhetorical encouragement — they might be well-advised to do so. But the party as of yet faces no imperative to abandon policies that benefit the general public, for the sake of appeasing Silicon Valley titans.

Per the memo, these cuts appear related to Amazon’s controversial return to office policy. In September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy notified employees that they would be expected to return to the office five days per week beginning in 2025, but the decision sparked blowback from employees. “We identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn’t solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads,” wrote SVP Drew Herdener in the memo seen by TechCrunch. “To address this and do the right thing for the business, we’re eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability.” Herdener referenced a recent meeting with Jassy, where the CEO said that reducing company headcount was not a goal of reorganizing the workforce; Herdener claims that the overall headcount of his department will remain unchanged once Amazon rehires for some of these roles at lower levels. When reached by TechCrunch, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser declined to tell TechCrunch how many jobs were eliminated. The laid off employees will receive “financial support, benefit continuation, and job placement assistance,” per the memo. These cuts in sustainability and corporate responsibility roles come less than two weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had a close-up seat at the inauguration, sitting close behind Trump and alongside other tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sergey Brin. Bezos, like other prominent tech founders, donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. The layoffs at Amazon stem from a restructuring project that began before Trump’s election. But the relationship between Bezos and the new administration could be a harbinger of future corporate moves at Amazon. Since Trump took office, Amazon has already canceled some diversity and inclusion initiatives, which have also been targeted by the new administration. Trump’s administration has already reversed sustainability initiatives at a federal level. So far, the president has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty addressing climate change. He even declared a national emergency in order to promote the production of fossil fuels, as opposed to more sustainable energy sources. Updated to include Amazon’s decline.

lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis. While everyone was busy reassuring themselves the stock market was still A-OK, the driver of the market--the AI fad--just burned to the waterline. Yes, the current euphoric expectations for AI are a fad, the latest in the endless stream of "gotta have" status signifiers and cultural frenzies. The core dynamic in all fads is Human Wetware 1.0. Though we glorify our individuality--The primacy of the Individual is the key characteristic of Modernity--we remain a herd animal, alert to every twitch in the herd's emotional state and anxious to join the herd when it starts running, lest we're left behind or lose status. CEOs are just as prone to fads as the rest of us, and this is how the AI fad gathered momentum. A decade ago the warm-and-fuzzy tech fad that enamored every corporate HQ was fuzzy logic, one of the long line of precursors to the current AI mania. So labels touting "fuzzy logic" were slapped on rice cookers as everyone scrambled to cash in on the latest tech fad. And so now every package of Kroika Cookies is emblazoned with "powered by AI!" Indeed. The leaders of the herd are especially keen to study every shift in the zeitgeist and the pecking order, as the greatest sin for CEOs is to be revealed as incompetent / clueless by missing the latest boat in corporate fads. Here is one example of the catastrophic consequences not of missing the boat but of blindly climbing on board. On a flight to Shanghai in May 2000, shortly after the NASDAQ dot-com bubble had peaked, my seatmate was a senior engineer working for a Silicon Valley semiconductor equipment maker. Over the course of the long flight, he recounted the domino-like chain of disastrous results of the CEO jumping on the "gotta offshore production" fad that was sweeping through Corporate America. The net result of moving production to Southeast Asia and China was 1) the wholesale theft of intellectual property (IP) and 2) the collapse of quality, requiring technicians to be flown in to fix all the quality problems. But to not move production overseas would have been perceived as "missing the boat," so everyone rushed to join the thundering herd, whether it made any sense or not. The second dynamic in play now is this: monopolies don't care about efficiency or quality, as the user / consumer has no real alternative. The tech world is brimming with stories of corporate wealth being squandered on teams developing efficiencies that are shelved upon completion. The more money gushing into the corporate coffers, the less interest there is in efficiencies. Keeping the Good Ship Status Quo on course is good enough--until the Status Quo burns to the waterline. Then the scramble is to cover the disastrous mis-allocation of corporate capital and identify the next fad to join. The third dynamic is: this isn't about one company. It's about a toolbox that's already infected the entire tech world. It doesn't matter if DeepSeek disappears tomorrow: the toolbox of software structures they've released has already entered the bloodstream of global tech and has already transformed the DNA. There's no going back to brute-force processing as any sort of competitive advantage. Rather, it's a cost anchor that will drag any denialist laggards to the bottom. The fourth dynamic is: there's nothing investable in this disruption because everyone can now develop the same open-source tools and approaches. there is no monopolistic moat to guarantee profits, and no revenue stream to milk. Rather, like deploying billions of dollars on data farms to improve search, there is no revenue at all. Nobody's paying a single dollar for AI enhanced search. As I've noted before, when the tools and techniques are freely available to all, there's no scarcity value to any of it. And with no scarcity value--no value proposition so mighty that people will pay a premium for it--then profits are thin to zero. The "smart money" has noted the AI fad has burned to the waterline, and has been frantically assuring "dumb money" that the stock market bubble is still intact and poised to bubble higher, so there's no reason to sell, and every reason to "buy the dip" so the "smart money" can sell, sell, sell near the top and let the "dumb money" absorb the coming 80% decline as a fad that was poorly conceived from the start has burned to the waterline, and the tiniest wave will send it to the bottom. The "safe bet" was on heavily moated tech behemoths dumping billions of dollars into the "competitive advantage" of energy-ravenous processing power. That "safe bet" is now in Davy Jones' Locker. The reality that "AI has no revenues and no profits" is lingering above the burned-out hulk as a haze of doubt and confusion. What's the next fad? Stay tuned. It might just be a retro revival of the time-tested fad for cost-cutting and "return to basics," starting with mass layoffs and slashing capex budgets. Sometimes wide moats and billions of dollars to blow lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis.

The company is laying off dozens of people in the department, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). “Following a recent review, we’re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in the report. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been cut at the company since Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021, according to the report. These included 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles, per the report. Jassy said in September that Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online at the time, Jassy wrote that Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organization’s ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time. It was reported Jan. 15 that tech giants Meta and Microsoft were cutting back on their headcounts, with Meta set to cut its workforce by 5% and Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its consulting business and lay off some employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that monitors job cuts in the tech sector, 545 tech companies laid off a total of 152,664 employees in 2024. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

In a note to staffers viewed by CNBC, Drew Herdener, who oversees public relations and corporate responsibility, wrote that the company is eliminating some jobs in those groups as part of a wider review into the "current org design" of the divisions. "As we examined our current org design and decided on the shifts outlined above, we identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn't solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads," Herdener wrote. "To address this and do the right thing for the business, we're eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability. This is a difficult decision to make and one that my leadership team and I do not take lightly." Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the layoffs and said in a statement that the job cuts would "help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers." Bloomberg earlier reported the job cuts. Herdener went on to say that the company may rehire some employees for roles at lower levels, "and in others, we will redistribute the headcount to other areas within the org." Amazon will provide financial support, continued benefits and job-placement assistance to laid-off staffers, Herdener said. Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company in 2022 and 2023 as part of CEO Andy Jassy's efforts to rein in costs. It had smaller rounds of job cuts in 2024 that are stretching into this year. The company has also continued to wind down some of its more experimental or unprofitable initiatives, including a "Try Before You Buy" clothing service and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery program. Herdener said Amazon is streamlining its communications and sustainability divisions after the organization "grew quite a bit" in recent years. Herdener's role expanded in recent years and he now also oversees corporate responsibility, which includes the sustainability group. Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding staffers to its corporate workforce and in its hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. Its global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company had more than 1.5 million employees as of the end of the third quarter. Amazon is also making some changes to its "hub strategy," which dictates the offices teams primarily use, as part of the reorganization, Herdener said. The goal is to have "more team members working in the same physical location as the majority of their teammates and/or manager," he wrote. Herdener said he is leaving it up to his direct reports to decide which locations make sense for their teams. Earlier this month, Amazon began requiring corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office. In a push to get employees back to the office, some staffers were told to relocate to hubs in different states. Several Amazon employees told CNBC following the announcement of the "return to hub" policy that they had chosen to leave the company instead of relocating. As part of the five-day office mandate, Amazon also set a goal to flatten its corporate structure by having fewer managers in each organization. Amazon has made sustainability a bigger directive within the company. It set ambitious climate goals in 2019, including a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2040. It also aims to power its business operations with renewable energy sources by 2025, and has amassed a portfolio of more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.

Title: Marketers Say They Are Ready To Move Beyond Google Search
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmo/2025/01/29/marketers-say-they-are-ready-to-move-beyond-google-search/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T17:20:35Z

Search is changing and marketers say they’re ready for it. A new study from Botify found that 94% of marketing leaders say they are at least somewhat prepared to optimize brand visibility for AI search, with almost 42% saying they’re very prepared. Not only are they prepared, but they’re enthusiastic, too. Nearly two-thirds were excited by Gartner’s prediction that AI chatbots will cause a 25% drop in traditional search engine traffic by 2026, and 74% were excited by what they’ve seen so far with ChatGPT Search. While the study shows that marketers are welcoming the challenge of moving away from Google’s long dominance in basic online search, how they’re getting ready is different across the board. More than six in 10 said they’re adjusting their strategies, but what they’re adjusting for varies. The survey asked marketers what they think of when someone mentions non-Google search, and while OpenAI products got high marks—56% think of ChatGPT and 42% think of SearchGPT—many are thinking more along the lines of traditional social channels. YouTube was the most popular alternative, with just over two-thirds thinking of it, but Meta and TikTok were each considered by about 40% of respondents. (The study was conducted in December, before the TikTok ban-or-sale law was upheld or enacted.) Nearly 45% thought about e-commerce giant Amazon. While marketers have been working on their social media and e-commerce search strategies for years, there’s a steep learning curve in figuring out just what to do for generative AI marketing plans. Just over half—55%—say understanding how platforms work is a major challenge. About the same amount said they’re concerned about data privacy. And nearly half are worried about how to keep up with the pace of innovation. The good news for marketers is that there’s a lot in flux with generative AI search. Tools are being refined, algorithms are changing, systems are “learning” better answers, and different types of information are being prioritized. It’s a good time for marketers to experiment and try new things to see what works, especially since generative AI platforms are doing the same thing. And the fact that most marketers see this as an opportunity means that creative solutions are likely to come from all areas, with potential for unexpected and positive results. Technology has been changing the way things work for years. It’s had huge impacts on creators, democratizing the ability for people to create something, put it out into the world and have it make a difference. Legendary record industry executive Steve Stoute saw opportunities in technology, and harnessed its opportunity for the music industry by starting UnitedMasters in 2017. I talked to him about how UnitedMasters is augmenting the creator economy, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The CNN logo outside its Atlanta studios. Another sign of the times for traditional broadcast media: Last week, CNN cut about 6% of its workforce—about 200 employees, mainly on the broadcast side—but continued hiring for digital media jobs. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes the cuts shouldn’t have been a surprise. CNN has been losing viewership as many people change the way they look for and consume news. Benzinga reports that since the election in November, CNN has lost 47% of its primetime viewers, hitting a 30-year ratings low for the network. When the cuts were announced, CNN CEO Mark Thompson said the network will soon launch a streaming service, revamp its digital footprint and subscriber services and make changes to its lineup—and the total headcount at the news organization should be about the same when all is done. Bloom writes that Thompson has been working for about a year to figure out how to remake CNN for today’s viewer. Many other legacy networks that have seen the same types of issues—especially MSNBC and ABC News—are likely to be paying close attention. An image from László Gaál's video. A new, “speculative” commercial featuring Porsche from digital artist László Gaál is attracting a lot of attention. It tells the story of the Italian Pisano family, which has long been known in their small village for having extremely flexible necks. The reason: A neighbor of their ancestral home who loves sports cars regularly drives the latest Porsche models past the Pisanos’ balcony. The detailed story, which includes a variety of locations, a large cast and innovative camera shots, isn’t the attention-grabbing part. The entire commercial—including the vast majority of the “How I made this” behind-the-scenes interview with Gaál at the end—was AI-generated, writes Forbes contributor Roger Dooley. Gaál used Veo2 from Google DeepMind, which is still in experimental mode, to create everything except the scenes when he personally is on camera, spinning a tale of the locations, cast and crew needed for the commercial. Unlike the somewhat clunky and not-always-logical AI-generated Coca-Cola holiday commercials last year, this commercial is widely praised for its realistic feel. On a Reddit thread, Gaál said the entire commercial took about three weeks to make. The video has several disclaimers throughout that indicate it was made almost entirely by AI (and was also not actually created in conjunction with Porsche). But more obscure, low tech AI creations—known as AI slop—are increasingly proliferating on social media, often without anything to tell viewers that the images aren’t real. On Facebook, some users post over-the-top AI-generated images, sometimes daring people to believe them. They’re widely believed and accepted as real. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “loved” a viral AI-generated photo last week of a baker who created an intricate loaf of challah bread shaped like an actual-size horse, Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido writes. The photo was originally posted on a Polish satire site, and has been widely shared to show the baker’s “feat”—despite the fact that designing and baking a complex loaf of bread that size that looks so good is a nearly impossible task. And Di Placido writes Zuckerberg’s reaction could just be recognizing a well-made AI-generated image. The header photo on the centibillionaire’s own Facebook page is an AI-generated one of llamas standing on and around computer servers. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about why his business model—and the creator economy as a whole—is thriving. This conversation contains expletives, and has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. 2024 was an incredible year for UnitedMasters, especially with UnitedMasters artist FloyyMenor having the global No. 1 song on TikTok, “Gata Only.” What did you see proven with your business model last year? Stoute: When we first did this, I knew that [it would help] the mid-to-long tail artists, who probably would’ve never gotten a record deal because they couldn’t get to New York or LA, to the cities where record deals were given out, or because they took longer to develop. They would not necessarily get a deal. If we were able to give them a home, they would be able to earn a living by doing what they love. It’s being able to earn a living with doing something you love. That, I think, [is] what makes the world a better place, so that’s what I was focused on. All of a sudden, it wasn’t just for the mid-to-long tail. The big frontline artists wanted independence. They wanted to own their masses. They wanted to get the economics in their favor. And with FloyyMenor from Chile, he didn't have to go to Miami or LA or New York to get a record deal. He uploaded the song from his home and had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year, the No. 6 Spotify song of the year, a top 10 Apple Music song of the year. What that means is we’re happy. That’s another artist who got a chance to maximize their economics because of our platform. No. 2, what it shows is that the metric that the big guys use to justify success, we’re doing that too. We weren’t ever in the game that had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year. We were here to give people a platform and allow them the opportunity to do what they love and earn a living. It’s like if somebody's writing on Substack and then they’re the No. 1 published author in the New York Times. They didn’t build Substack for that. They built it for people to make a living. But if it hits that metric, then all of a sudden Penguin and all the big guys go, wait a minute. They’re playing in my game. How does the creator economy play into your business? I felt like musicians were left out of the creator economy because everyone thought the labels were handling that. The creator economy was really focused on gamers and makeup bloggers and vloggers and things like that. The music people had this thing called a record company. So that was that. The artists that did not have record deals were like: We are part of the creator economy. I think SoundCloud benefited from that. Early on, SoundCloud harbored the creator economy musicians, and then they wanted more. They didn’t want to just be on SoundCloud. They wanted distribution and opportunities. When I built UnitedMasters, I was building it not only to provide artist distribution, but we had Translation. We worked with the NBA and State Farm and AT&T and Meta, to name a few. We can not only distribute these artists, but we can do deals for them with some of these brands. The combination of being able to go to one place and get your music distributed, plus have access to brands for larger opportunities was the ecosystem I thought and I know, and is proving to be what a music company should look like going forward. From what you see, what is in store for 2025 for the creator economy as a whole? Outside of live sports, that’s where brands want to put their money. You have NFL, NBA, hockey, WNBA, and then you have the creator economy. You have podcasters and bloggers and streamers and musicians, and you’re like, how can I ring-fence that so I could measure the results within that infrastructure, and how can I protect brand safety in doing that? Brands are saying, I’m all-in for that. What the creator economy has to do is get brand ready: My shit’s together, it’s brand-friendly, it’s measurable. You can rely on us. Now you’re talking about a new medium that has money rushing towards it, that they didn’t expect to happen so fast so soon. They have to get leveled up. Major League Baseball reported it hit record revenues in 2024, with the largest one-season growth since 2015. $12.1 billion: Last year’s revenues, according to the league $1.9 billion: League and club sponsorships in 2024 ‘We’ve had a good year. Our business was strong’: MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Sportico in October, during the World Series While Bud Light’s now-infamous partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney caused fallout for the brand, not all of it was because conservative consumers were offended. The actual strategy was lacking, writes Forbes contributor Gillian Oakenfull. Here’s how to build a strategy for inclusivity campaigns so they won’t be seen as symbolic gestures, especially if they push the envelope. Storytelling is an important component of marketing, but it’s also a tool for leadership. Here are some ways to use storytelling to better connect with your team, build trust, and inspire ideas.

Feedback The job market for MBA graduates has reached a critical juncture, sparking conversations across social media and beyond. A post by CA Nitin Kaushik on X, using the handle @Finance_Bareek, captured the sentiment perfectly: “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling.” Kaushik’s post resonates with a growing number of MBA aspirants and professionals grappling with the changing realities of the job market. The issue isn’t confined to India; even graduates from elite institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are feeling the squeeze. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees: ₹25,00,000 ROI: Uncertain Research before enrolling. 🎓💡#stockmarketcrash #niftycrash #financetips #investingbehaviour The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 MBA graduates were jobless three months after graduation. This number has more than doubled since 2022 when it stood at 10%. Other top-tier schools like Stanford and Wharton have seen similar dips, with unemployment rates hovering around 20%. The issue isn’t just limited to the US. According to the International Labor Organisation’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024, 13% of the global youth labour force was unemployed in 2023—a figure representing nearly 65 million people. Why are MBAs struggling? Despite boasting median starting salaries exceeding $175,000, MBA graduates are finding it harder to land jobs due to shifting hiring practices. Consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, alongside tech giants such as Google and Amazon, have drastically reduced MBA hires amid widespread layoffs and economic slowdowns. Post-pandemic structural changes have also left companies preferring smaller, highly skilled teams. The rise of AI and automation further compounds the issue, making generalist MBA degrees less appealing compared to targeted certifications and boot camps. Kristen Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development at Harvard Business School, put it bluntly: “Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator.” Instead, companies are now focusing on technical and specialized skills. How MBA Education Needs to Evolve To address these challenges, institutions are pivoting toward innovative solutions. Harvard is testing an AI tool to match graduates with jobs and suggest courses to bridge skill gaps. Some graduates have found success by lowering their expectations and opting for less conventional roles, according to Forbes. One thing is clear—degrees alone won’t cut it anymore. The future belongs to professionals who continuously upskill to meet the ever-changing demands of the workforce. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: The Scoop: As Trump admin flexes muscle, Target retreats from DEI

Also: Proposed TikTok sale could change platform’s algorithm; RTO unfairness poses PR challenges. Also: Proposed TikTok sale could change platform’s algorithm; RTO unfairness poses PR challenges. Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808863/trumps-rto-edict-raises-concerns-over-morale-efficiency-and-burnout.html

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.
