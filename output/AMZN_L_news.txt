Please try again Silicon Valley companies, especially those that rely heavily on international supply chains, have seen their stocks drop precipitously since President Trump revealed his tariff plan on April 2. A 10% tariff on all imported goods went into effect on April 5 and higher tariffs on specific countries (like China and Mexico) are scheduled to begin on April 9. While it’s unclear whether all the tariffs are here to stay, companies are already acting as if Trump will deliver on his threats in the long term. More of Apple’s iPhones, famously constructed from parts sourced all over the world, may soon be assembled in India to sidestep Chinese tariffs that could raise the hardware cost of the iPhone 16 Pro by $300 each. Nintendo is delaying pre-orders for the new Switch 2 in the U.S. while it games out-market conditions. It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat.

It’s about to become much more expensive for Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft to build the supercomputers to power artificial intelligence, and while they have the cash reserves to stay in the game, rivals in China and elsewhere will become a graver threat. The global economy has run on international trade for half a century. So, Trump’s decision to upend the status quo is disruptive for global industries like tech. “Apple and Tesla and other leading firms are selling to people all across the world,” said economics professor Neale Mahoney, who is also director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “We’re going to really feel that in not just the stock price of these firms, but their decisions around investment and expansion, and ultimately, their decisions to pull back.” Russell Hancock, head of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies economic and social trends in the region, says he can’t see any silver lining for tech companies, whether or not they’re involved in manufacturing or consumer retail. Meta, Google and Amazon, for instance, enjoy enormous ad revenues that could suffer from a foreign retreat in spending. “Personally, I think [Trump’s new tariff regime] is crazy,” Hancock said. “What I see is instability, retaliation [from other countries], and the upsetting of international systems that have been in place for a very long time.” He also predicts more layoffs in the Bay Area if Trump doesn’t change course soon. But Hancock isn’t just talking about tariffs. The San Francisco Bay Area has historically enjoyed a proximity to top academic institutions like Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and San José State University, providing a ready talent pool and a steady stream of start-ups. However, those universities are facing uncertainties and enacting job freezes as the Trump administration tries to limit the National Institutes of Health research funding they rely on, as well as research into emerging technologies like quantum computing. The Trump administration is also taking on the H1B visa popular in Silicon Valley by shutting down the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which helps applicants who are struggling to get their cases processed. Tech companies are telling immigrant employees on visas not to leave the U.S., for fear they might not be let back in. “We’re already seeing that companies are expanding elsewhere, at a faster rate than they are here, in Silicon Valley,” Hancock said. “If you’re a major tech company, you’ve also been adding people in Boston, Miami, London and Asia. [Tariffs] will accelerate that trend.” He also anticipates that companies and individuals from abroad will not be as keen to invest in the Bay Area as they have been over the last half century. Some Valley watchers are holding out hope that the president is rattling his sabre as a bargaining tactic to wring more concessions from the nation’s trading partners. But venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and technology investor Chamath Palihapitiya, co-host of the mostly libertarian “All-In” podcast, said on the podcast he doesn’t believe Trump will back down because the president has consistently spoken in favor of tariffs as a macroeconomic tool to restore American manufacturing supremacy lost over the last 40 years. Missing from the public conversation, in news articles and social media, are the direct voices of tech company leaders. This is in large part due to fears of attracting negative attention from the Trump administration. “CEOs with large global supply chains can’t be outspoken on this topic publicly because they need to cut deals,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, wrote on social media platform X. “But this is the tone of the convos happening right now,” he added, reposting pointedly negative comments about the tariffs from tech analyst Dan Ives. “If these tariffs (in current form/rates) hold, there is no debate … it would set the US tech world back a decade in our opinion while China is the clear winner,” Ives wrote. Ives continued, “In one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside down supply chain, massive costs … and slow down US tech innovation.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our privacy policy.

Title: How Businesses Are Dealing With Impending Tariffs

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Tariffs have dominated the thoughts, discussions and decisions of business executives, investors and economists just about as soon as President Donald Trump took office. Hours after being sworn in on January 20, he announced his intention to start 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even though these tariffs were initially delayed a month, they took effect—and the world’s businesses knew Trump’s threats were solid. As much of the world prepares to begin paying new tariffs of at least 10% tomorrow, businesses have taken different steps to assess and control the impact on their businesses, revenues and sales. Klarna and StubHub were both planning to IPO, but decided to put their market debuts on hold due to ongoing volatility. Nintendo, already facing scrutiny for the higher-then-expected $449.99 price for its new Switch 2, decided to push back last Friday’s pre-order date for the game console, citing the need to better assess levies and market conditions. Volkswagen will add an “import fee” to cars sold in the U.S. starting later this month, the New York Times reports, and is holding off on imports while it figures out tariffs. Then there are companies and industries experts are confident can get through this period with few problems. Forbes’ Phoebe Liu writes Amazon is likely to do well, largely because it has the infrastructure already in place to shift pricing to consumers and sellers and deliver items quickly and efficiently. While Amazon’s prices are likely to take a hit, analysts told Liu, everyone else’s prices will experience the same, so Amazon will perform relatively well. The National Retail Federation also delivered a sanguine forecast for the industry, saying they expect no tariff-related changes to their annual forecast, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The retail group isn’t ignoring the impact of tariffs, and they acknowledge that consumer and business confidence may be dropping, but NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said it’s not time to count out the American consumer. As uncertainty persists, finance departments are looking to save their businesses money wherever possible. And even though fewer M&A transactions are going forward this year than predicted, some dealmaking is taking place. One area that’s often overlooked—and can be quite costly—is third-party service contracts. I talked to Nate Buniva, a partner at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe , about how not to lose money on contracts in a transaction. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. It’s spring break season and we’ll be taking next week off from Forbes CFO. We’ll be back on Tuesday, April 22. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Stocks rallied slightly Tuesday morning over a bit of optimism that Trump may be willing to cut tariff deals. He wrote on social media that he had a “great call” with South Korea’s Choi Sang-muk, and “China also wants to make a deal, badly.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on CNBC that he believes “we can end up with some good deals” if other companies come to the table. Regardless, Wall Street has not reacted well to the idea of tariffs. Since Trump’s announcement, the Nasdaq is down 8.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 7.8%, and the S&P 500 is down 8.3% Warnings are incoming from many economists and banks. JPMorgan Chase issued 60% odds of a recession, labeling Trump’s policies as the “largest tax increase” since 1968, which will “fall heavily on the US consumer.” Goldman Sachs increased their recession odds to 45% on Sunday, and cautioned that unless Trump capitulated, recession is their baseline economic forecast. UBS Investment Bank chief strategist Bhanu Baweja described the economic issue with tariffs as “a manmade problem, concentrated really around one man.” And if Trump were to change his mind, “suddenly the whole algebra changes.” Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov surveyed 50 top Wall Street investors, more than half of whom initially supported Trump’s policies, and found that their confidence in him is gone. Nearly three-quarters say his plan has been ineffective, and 54% of former supporters say he is failing. At the very least, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman, Trump’s tariffs are risking the U.S.’s reputation as a stable and predictable global partner for trade and investment—something that might be extremely difficult to get back in the years when Trump is out of office. Federal employees rally in support of their jobs last month outside a federal building in Chicago. Unemployment is climbing, according to figures from the Labor Department last week. In March, the U.S. added 228,000 non-farm jobs, more than economists’ estimates of 140,000. But unemployment was up to 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% forecasts. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a 60% increase in March layoffs, with more than 275,000 jobs eliminated last month. Nearly 80% of those cuts were in federal government jobs through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Last month’s numbers were the highest since Covid-19 pandemic-related cuts in spring 2020. Court orders have directed the federal government to rehire more than 26,000 of those terminated employees so far, but the government is continuing to appeal and most of the employees appear to be on paid administrative leave for the time being, CBS reports. However, Trump continuously touts his tariffs as a job creator: Companies will be drawn to start manufacturing products in the U.S. again, so they will build factories that will employ Americans. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that’s an inaccurate way to look at the situation. Manufacturing has always been alive and well in the U.S., and the industry is at record-high levels from a productivity standpoint. Many items that are not manufactured in the U.S. today are inexpensive or commodity products, which is keeping with the country’s development as technology improves. Even if lower-level manufacturing comes back to the U.S. as a result of tariffs, it takes years to plan, build and staff a factory, so changes are years away. A sign at a Capital One Café in Miami. The $35 billion merger of Capital One and Discover made it past the Justice Department’s antitrust review, bringing the deal closer to the finish line, according to multiple reports. When the deal was first announced in February 2024, many analysts questioned if it would go through. President Joe Biden’s administration halted several mergers for antitrust reasons, including JetBlue’s planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and Kroger’s planned purchase of Albertsons. The New York Times reports that in January, before Trump’s inauguration, Biden’s Justice Department had drafted an interim memo that outlined concerns that the Capital One-Discover tie-up could harm consumers. The merger is not a done deal yet. It still needs approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analysts believe the Justice Department would be the most likely to object; the Times writes the Federal Reserve hasn’t denied a bank merger application since 2003. But if this goes through, it’s the first big financial deal that will have made it through the Trump Administration’s brand of scrutiny. Nate Buniva, partner at West Monroe. Every business has third-party contracts for services and IT platforms, which can often be forgotten during an M&A transaction. Nate Buinva, a partner at management and technology consulting firm West Monroe, is an expert at paying attention to these contracts—which he said can save 40% to 60% in a transaction if managed correctly. I talked to him about how to properly handle third-party contracts on both sides of an M&A deal. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Are there any types of contracts that tend to be overlooked more than others? Buniva: It’s a lot of work to read the T’s and C’s of these large enterprise agreements and understand what it can mean from a dollars and cents perspective. Often the contract piece does get overlooked or just not talked about. It’s like: This is what we spend on our ERP, this is what we spend on our collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams, but there’s not always that double click of: In this merger, do we have the right to terminate one agreement and get [the new entity] on the other, or are we going to be held with double cost? Reading through these legal documents is not the most exciting, and M&A transactions move quickly, too. You have to do the 80/20 rule, and get up to speed quickly on what you have, and make educated decisions to move forward. Is there anything that companies planning to be involved in an M&A transaction in the near future should consider when they get into contracts? Absolutely. You want to put in clauses that contemplate where you have the ability to scale the way you can structure your pricing in a tiered fashion, whereas volume goes up, you see a preferred discount on a per-unit level. Let’s say you currently only have 100 service requests right now, and you would do a tier that would take you up into the thousands. The reason you’re tiering it so high, when you do acquire a new company, you are already set up with your existing providers at a price point that says: I want you to honor this discount because I’m bringing you this extra volume. You don’t want to be in a position of doing that acquisition and you’re paying the 100-unit rate, but your volume’s 1,000. You can put in change-of-control language that says pricing or the terms need to be reevaluated if there is a change of control and you’re being sold off or absorbed. Even if you're not contemplating a transaction in the future, you never know what’s going to happen. You may as well put it in. More and more vendors are open to that because in general, yes, they may have to provide more discounted pricing, but they want the additional volume. What advice would you give to a CFO on either side of a transaction? It takes a dedicated team. My guidance is to make sure you’ve cleared people's bandwidth internally and do a review of your third-party agreements. I would also recommend they bring in an expert externally to look at this stuff and build an inventory. Oftentimes, your procurement, IT or finance orgs don’t necessarily have the subject matter expertise. Your legal team will know what contractual rights you’ll have, but they don’t know where the market is on what you can negotiate out of or what tools you can use. Every department has their own contracts. If you don’t have it, build a centralized database. You’re going to want to look at when does the contract end? How much are you spending? What’s the service? Do you have termination rights? As you contemplate the transaction, you need to start talking with the other entity about what they have and where there’s overlap, or if you're being sold off, what gaps will you have as a new entity where you need to now go stand up your own agreements. All of that takes a lot of time and runway, so the other piece of advice is do it ASAP. Where you don’t want to be—and this is when we’ve been called in the past—is at the end hour: Oh my gosh, we’re going to be a standalone company next month. We don’t have a Microsoft agreement. We can do that, but if it had been a more thoughtful journey, then you can get better pricing, terms, service levels, all of that stuff across all of your services. Oftentimes CFOs are focused on what’s the cost synergy, the headcount reduction or the opportunity to scale this business? But third-party spend is a huge component of that. Elon Musk, who is slashing government spending through DOGE, has spoken out against tariffs. Forbes’ John Hyatt examines how much Musk’s business empire has to lose through the new taxes levied by Trump. 20%-25%: Proportion of car parts Tesla imported last year from nations excluding Canada. About 40% of battery materials come from Chinese suppliers $68 million: Value of a Starlink contract canceled by Ontario Premier Doug Ford in response to Trump’s trade war.

Here are 10 things all federal contractors should do, both those who are seeing funding canceled and those who may yet be on the chopping block. Even though many CFOs and CIOs say they work well together as a unified team, there are often serious differences when it comes to ownership and ROI for tech investments, and that can lead to botched tech rollouts. Here are some tips to improve that relationship for maximum success. Last week, a CEO used profanity on a live interview with CNBC as he reacted to his company’s stock price falling after a poor earnings report and Trump’s tariff announcement. In the days since, this CEO has said the tariffs will actually help his company. Which company does he lead? A. BlackBerry B. Restoration Hardware C. Penguin Solutions D.

Title: Shopify's Toby Lütke doubles down on his hardcore 2025 messaging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-toby-lutke-efficiency-mandatory-messaging-internal-memo-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke is going all in on hardcore tech messaging. In a memo to employees that he posted on X on Monday, Lütke wrote: "In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify." "This sounds daunting, but given the nature of the tools, this doesn't even sound terribly ambitious to me anymore," Lütke wrote, referring to artificial intelligence. The memo — titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation" — directed employees to ramp up their AI usage at the Canadian e-commerce firm. Lütke said using the technology is "now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify" and that AI usage would be gauged in performance and peer review questionnaires. He added that the expectations apply to himself and all executives as well. The CEO appears to be reversing his reputation as a founder who values work-life balance. Last month, in response to an X post that touted him as an example of balancing work and family, Lütke wrote: "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend. I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Lütke has since deleted most of his 2019 tweets, including one that said: "I've never worked through a night. The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so. I need 8ish hours of sleep a night. Same with everybody else, whether we admit it or not." In 2023, Lütke restricted Shopify employees from having side hustles, saying the company required their "unshared attention." The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Shopify CEO's remarks reflect a broader cultural crackdown on Big Tech workers, who have enjoyed a work culture known for office perks, top-line pay, and job security, sometimes without grueling hours. Across the industry, free massages and football tables have been replaced with messaging around "efficiency" and "scrappiness and frugality." At tech giants like Amazon and TikTok, pandemic-era work-from-home luxuries have been replaced by strict return-to-office mandates. At nearly every company, layoffs have taken a wrecking ball to the industry and AI adoption has cut hiring, making job security a thing of the past. "We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his RTO memo in September. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration." Workers who spoke to Business Insider said they are feeling the pressure to work longer hours, go beyond what is asked of them, be highly visible, and evaluate other options beyond full-time work.

Title: SSA reorg plan contemplates field office closures, contradicting public statements

Two people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit. Jim West / UCG / Universal Images Group / Getty Images Stay Connected Erich Wagner and Natalie Alms Updated April 7 at 8:27 p.m. ET A draft plan for service delivery at the Social Security Administration includes “field office consolidation” as a goal for next year — even as the agency maintains publicly that it isn’t closing field offices. SSA posted Monday on X that it “is NOT permanently closing field offices. Only underutilized hearing office space has been closed and without permanently closing field offices.” But a plan circulating within the agency includes a goal to “further reduce footprint” in 2026 and beyond. The scope of the envisioned "consolidations" is unclear, though the document singles out field offices as on the chopping block next year. This comes after billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency posted information about nearly 50 field offices it was planning to shutter. SSA has said that news reports about plans to close field offices are incorrect. The draft plan, originally sent March 21 and obtained by Government Executive, is required by the Trump administration by April 14 as part of its push to gut the federal workforce and reorganize agencies. Asked for comment Monday, SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann wrote, "There is no validity to this claim." At the same time the agency is contemplating plans to shutter offices, it also is moving ahead with new identity proofing requirements expected to push more people to those offices. SSA is ending phone service for many of its benefits applications, as well as those looking to make changes to their direct deposit information, leaving them with online or in-person avenues to do so. Some regional leaders that oversee field offices still haven’t gotten guidance on implementing the changes, which are scheduled to take place next week, according to one current employee. SSA is also looking to shed thousands of employees. The March 21 document says that the agency plans to cut 5,500 employees by the end of the fiscal year as part of the agency’s plan to get down to 50,000 employees, as Government Executive previously reported. Martin O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during the final year of President Biden’s term, said that several elements of the plan, including further consolidations of the agency’s phone systems under Amazon Web Services and the development of a “digital service index” that elucidates which agency services can be conducted by phone, online or in-person, were already under discussion during his tenure. But none of it can be effectively done while reducing staff at the agency, which is already at a half-century low. “Except for the butchering of an agency that has already been reduced to a 50-year low in staffing, many of these things were things we had put into motion during my team, and some of it reflects the good work of the Office of Transformation ... A lot of those things should happen, but none will make up for the gutting the staff at this already depleted agency with a chainsaw,” he said. One operations component that formerly had about 400 feds now has only half that number, one current SSA employee told Government Executive. The office, a recent creation of what used to be two components, handles both operations support as well as some technology functions. “With the Regional offices gutted… no one will be left to support field offices when they have difficulty,” said the employee. Rich Couture, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees’ SSA General Committee, said he was alarmed to see the plan mention a hiring freeze at the agency, when Trump’s hiring freeze executive order specifically exempted employees who work on the delivery of Social Security benefits. He also noted that the reassignment of employees from regional and headquarters offices to frontline work constitutes a brain drain, both from those back-of-house components and from the frontline workforce. “From the union’s perspective, it made no sense to offer buyouts and early retirement to experienced frontline staff just to turn around and fill those vacancies with people who have no frontline experience, who will need months of training and years of on-the-job experience to become proficient in these complex programs,” Couture said. “And in order to train them, you need to take staff off the frontline to do so. It was an easily avoidable problem.” Couture said he too has heard concerns from frontline workers about the potential impact of the regional office consolidations and reassignments on the support employees in field offices and hearings offices need to do their jobs. “A lot of these components have positions that don’t make sense to put in a field office or a hearing office–you wouldn’t put an HR staffer into one of these offices, because it makes sense to have these staffed regionally and centrally,” he said. “One of the big concerns I’ve heard from employees of late is: What happens if all of these HR personnel are reassigned or RIFed and there’s not enough people to do the job, and then I decide at a later date that I want to retire or need to take some action with my insurance? That hasn’t been fleshed out yet.” SSA intends to push people online, the plan notes, by expanding what the public can do online with SSA, as opposed to going to an office in person or calling. Recently, however, people looking to reach the agency online have seen system outages as a result of new anti-fraud checks at the agency. The agency has also warned staff in its Office of the Chief Information Officer — which handles the agency's tech and is being led by a DOGE associate — of coming layoffs, calling the office's work "not mission critical,” one SSA employee told Government Executive. The agency says that it wants to ramp up the use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle calls. It hopes to use technology more broadly “to serve our increasing customer base with fewer employees,” the plan notes, including by fully automating the processing of most retirement and Medicare claims. O’Malley said the combination of increased anti-fraud measures–for an agency whose error rate is already under 1%–and funneling more people into online and AI-powered service lanes will crush the public’s faith in the agency. “There are things we could do to improve the level of customer service and ease of transaction for citizens and customers, but eliminating half the staff of the IT department is not one of those things and closing field offices is not one of those things,” he said. “Shutting down portals that had worked, whether online or via phone, to drive more people into the field offices–those are the things that actually destroy and degrade customer service, that appear designed to sour the public against the agency by cramming them into field offices.” Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the plans surrounding Medicare claims.

Title: Trade deficits happen for good reasons — not only from unfair practices

On April 2, the Trump administration announced a system of tariffs on imports into the United States. The executive order imposed 10% tariffs for imports from all countries (excluding Canada and Mexico, which remain subject to tariffs imposed over the last two months) which take effect April 5, with higher tariffs for countries with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficit, to begin April 9. This means that imports from the European Union will be tariffed at 20%, while imports from China will see tariffs of 34% (see here for the full list of tariff rates.) In the short run, these tariffs will lead to increased prices, particularly for household products, cars, construction materials and some food items. As an example, the U.S. imports the bulk of its jasmine rice from Thailand which will have a reciprocal tariff of 36%. The extent to which the 36% tariff will be borne by rice farmers in Thailand, importers, grocery stores or households depends on the relative price sensitivity of each of these groups, but economic consensus is that households will bear at least part of that cost through higher prices. Items from toothbrushes to cars to washing machines will be similarly affected. Changes in the relative price of some goods and an increase in economic uncertainty around the profitability of some lines of business will lead to changes in investment decisions by companies in the United States. Retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart will see margins tightened and will have decreased incentive to open new stores or expand existing retail locations. Auto manufacturers will delay production as they seek to understand the impact on their business from the changes in tariffs. One early example is Stellantis, the manufacturer of American auto brands Chrysler and Jeep, who announced on April 3 that it will pause production on some auto lines leading to temporary layoffs for 900 hourly U.S. workers. Delays in production and investment are likely to continue as uncertainty about the way that these policies will alter the U.S. economy are digested. These reductions in investment and production delays increase the near-term likelihood of a recession. If tariffs persist, they will change the composition of the U.S. economy. Tariffs increase the prices at which domestic producers of tariffed products can sell their goods. This increases potential profits in protected industries, leading to higher prices and often lower quality for manufactured goods. It also leads to shifts in the nature of goods produced in the economy. Previously profitable sectors of the economy will see decreased demand as prices rise which will lead to layoffs and a short-term increase in unemployment. If the tariffs continue, jobs will eventually migrate to more tariff-protected segments of the economy. This will lead to overall declines in growth however, as these tariff-protected regions of the economy grow because of the increased profits associated with tariffs as opposed to increases in the demand for their products. The executive order issued this week gives justification for the imposition of tariffs as “... a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption ...” However, the tariff rate imposed on our foreign trade partners seems to be proportional to the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with that country divided by the total dollar value of goods imported from that country, with a minimum rate of 10%. As such, the policy enshrines the idea that if there is a trade deficit, it is because of unfair trade policies on the part of foreign counterparties. Yet this is largely not consistent with the nature of trade. Just as most households run a trade deficit with the grocery store (“importing” goods from the store in exchange for money), we choose to import goods from abroad because they can be produced more efficiently there and we would rather use our productive capacity to produce higher-margin goods and services. We do not produce significant amounts of jasmine rice in the U.S. because doing so would be expensive for us and we would rather use our land and labor to produce goods and services that allow us to profit from our unique productive abilities. Complicating the role of tariffs is the reality that one cannot decouple foreign demand for American-produced goods, which reduces the trade deficit, from foreign demand for American assets, which increases it. When a U.S. distributor of luxury Swiss watches pays $5 million for a shipment of timepieces, the Swiss manufacturer of those timepieces can choose what to do with that $5 million. They can use those dollars to purchase American-made goods, or they can use that money to purchase American assets like real estate, stocks, bonds or Treasury securities. If they choose to purchase assets, then there is an increase in the trade deficit, which measures differences in the value of the shipment of goods (as opposed to assets) across borders. As such, the size of the trade imbalance with a country is inextricably linked to the relative desirability of American assets. The attractiveness in recent decades of American assets, and foreigners’ willingness to purchase them, is an important driver of our trade balance. This foreign investment in the U.S. because of the desirability of American assets has allowed U.S. companies to hire additional workers, produce additional products, and offer dividends that would not otherwise have been possible. A cooling of trade between countries as a result of tariffs will reduce this source of capital. One open question is whether the tariff announcement this week represents a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy that will persist throughout President Trump’s term in office, or whether it is the opening offer in bilateral trade negotiations to be had with our trading partners over the coming weeks, as has happened with Canada and Mexico since Trump’s inauguration in January. Retaliatory tariffs from across the world is also a high likelihood. Either way, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of policy in recent months and the questions that remain about the current proposal run the real risk of decreasing short-term investment and hiring by American companies and the desirability of American assets to foreigners. These risks have increased the likelihood of both inflation and decreased growth in the near term.

Title: Why Big Tech Interviews Take So Long. Here’s How To Beat The Process

ByCheryl Robinson ByCheryl Robinson, Contributor. Long interview processes at major tech companies are leaving job seekers waiting weeks for a ... More response. If you’ve ever felt like the interview process at a major tech company drags on forever, you’re not imagining things. A new study from Career.io confirms what many job seekers have suspected: landing a role at a top tech firm often means surviving a long, winding hiring process with the worst offenders keeping you waiting for nearly a month. The study analyzed publicly available data from 14 major U.S. tech companies, ranking them based on how long it typically takes to move from interview to job offer. The results? Some of the biggest names in the business aren’t just giants in innovation—they’re giants in hiring delays, too. At Oracle, candidates often wait close to four weeks for a response—if they receive one at all. According to reviews on Glassdoor, some candidates said their interview process lasted up to two months. Apple isn’t far behind, with an average turnaround time of 22 days. Adobe and Salesforce also require candidates to buckle up for a wait exceeding three weeks. While hiring managers may aim for the perfect fit, they inadvertently drive top talent away. Studies show that 82% of candidates lose interest in a role if the interview process drags on too long. This growing phenomenon, known as interview fatigue, occurs when job seekers become mentally and emotionally exhausted from drawn-out hiring procedures, repetitive interview rounds and unclear timelines. According to insights from Titus Talent, companies risk losing strong candidates not because of poor fit but because of poor processes. Amanda Augustine, a certified career coach at Career.io, says there’s a reason hiring has become more prolonged in recent years. “The tech industry has intensified the interview process, largely due to heightened competition stemming from layoffs,” she explains. “Hiring managers in big tech now hold more leverage than ever, implementing more rigorous and lengthy interview processes to identify the ‘best fit’ among a broader pool of applicants.” That means multiple interview rounds, technical assessments, culture-fit evaluations and follow-up conversations—all before a decision is made. Not every tech company is stuck in the slow lane. According to the report, Uber has the fastest hiring process, averaging just 9.34 days from interview to offer. Amazon (10.11 days) and Netflix (14.23 days) follow close behind. There’s a reason for this efficiency: Uber and Amazon rely heavily on high-turnover frontline workers like drivers and warehouse staff, necessitating a streamlined process. But it’s not just about speed for the sake of speed. Netflix, for example, emphasizes cultural alignment during their process, with multiple interviews and a final “vibe check” to ensure a strong team fit. Augustine notes, “Both Uber and Amazon have a reputation for hiring with flexibility in their workforce. The speed of drivers’ and warehouse workers’ onboarding has resulted in an expedited interview process, highlighting the operational priorities within the tech sector.” Interview fatigue is rising as candidates endure multiple rounds and extended timelines in today’s ... More competitive job market. Lengthy interviews aren’t going away anytime soon, but job seekers can approach them more strategically. Augustine recommends three ways to manage the marathon process: Interviewing at big tech firms may require patience, resilience, and a plan B. But with the right mindset and a few smart moves, candidates can stay in control—even when the process drags on.
