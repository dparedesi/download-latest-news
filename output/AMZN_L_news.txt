Amazon, which announced plans this week to reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 jobs, says it is laying off 760 jobs in Southern California beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence. Overall, Amazon says it will cut 1,540 positions in California — including 783 in Northern California, according to Vani Appukkutty, a senior manager in the company’s human resources department. In Southern California, layoffs are coming to Irvine (333), Culver City (152), San Diego (145) and Santa Monica (130). Also see: Disneyland lays off about 100 salaried employees The layoffs begin Jan. 26 and finish by April 1, Appukkutty wrote in Oct. 28 letters filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. “Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent,” she wrote. The filings were made as part of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act — commonly referred to as WARN — which are required when an employer lays off more than 50 employees. All affected employees are notified at least 60 days before their terminations are scheduled to occur, according to Appukkutty. The layoffs include positions for business intelligence, data, software and security engineers, contract managers, creative marketers, financial analysts, game artists and designers, lawyers, product managers, tax analysts and other administrative staff, according to the EDD letters. More job cuts: Santa Monica-based RAND cuts 11% of its workforce Appukkutty did not provide reasons for the layoffs or where in the tech giant the reductions would happen. However, news reports said that Amazon.com was gutting its video-game division in Irvine, San Diego and its central publishing division. The retailer also announced Oct. 3 that it would close four of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in Southern California by mid-November as it reevaluates store performance. Beth Galetti, senior vice president in charge of Amazon’s human resources department, wrote in an Oct. 28 blog post that artificial intelligence is enabling companies to “innovate much faster than ever before.” In announcing the 14,000 corporate layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon is convinced of the “need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said that the reductions are a continuation of the work to get even “stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources” to invest in Amazon’s future. The corporate layoffs mean “reducing in some areas and hiring in others,” she added. For instance, Amazon announced in early October that it planned to fill 30,000 new seasonal roles across California, including up to 8,000 roles in Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario — as well as up to 3,000 roles for the upcoming holidays across Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim, and 1,300 roles in San Diego, Chula Vista and Carlsbad. Many of the seasonal roles have the potential to transition into year-round employment with benefits, said Amazon spokeswoman Carly Levy in an Oct. 14 statement.Related Articles 2 Amazon Fresh grocery stores are closing in Orange County

Title: Is the job market frozen or faltering?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Layoffs raise alarms while young workers eye law school They call it the Great Freeze. That’s how some analysts describe the U.S. job market recently — a “low-hire, low-fire” environment where workers who have jobs are not losing them but finding a new job is difficult. But a thaw may be coming. A “slew” of “large-scale layoffs” may be a sign that the labor market is “starting to tip over,” said Axios. Amazon announced it will slash 14,000 jobs, UPS said it was cutting 48,000 positions, and Paramount said it was laying off 1,000 workers. The unemployment rate had hovered around 4% for more than a year, but that “apparent stability” has concealed “change beneath the surface.” Now, companies appear ready to “take advantage of the potential of AI to transform work.” This could mean fewer jobs for humans. The massive layoffs suggest the job market’s “current state of suspension has changed for the worse,” said MarketWatch. While companies are still comfortably profitable, they are waiting on the “dust to settle” from tariff negotiations, the government shutdown and the corporate adoption of AI. Amazon’s layoffs could be the tipping point. “We may see others join the fray,” said John Challenger, the CEO of career-services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The job market “could get ugly,” Dan DeFrancesco said at Business Insider. “About 20 more Amazon-sized layoffs” would upend the labor market. That scenario is “not out of the realm of possibility” because “companies are known to follow the lead of their bigger peers.” Meta’s 2022 layoff of 11,000 workers led to a much larger wave of tech sector job cuts. American companies have recently been in a “holding pattern,” but if they start to let workers go without replacing them, the “somewhat resilient job market could start to show some real cracks.” “The labor market is undeniably going through a transition,” Adam Hardy said at Money. Young workers are “canaries in the coal mine” since they are often the first to feel job market instability, and “young workers and recent college grads aren’t doing so well” at the moment. AI is often blamed, but there are other factors. Right now, there are “more graduates than there are jobs that require grads.” That’s a challenge that predates the rise of AI by “several years.” The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point this week to “shore up the softening job market,” said NPR. On top of private sector layoffs, the federal government has already cut about 100,000 jobs this year. American employment “may well be shrinking already,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier in October. Bad news for the job market might be good news for graduate programs. “Applications are on the rise” at law schools and MBA programs, said Fortune, with law school applications up 3% over last year. Gen-Z job seekers are buying “more time to figure out what’s next” instead of “facing the bleak job market head-on.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Joel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

Title: Amazon says it didn't cut people because of money. But because of 'culture'
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy’s explanation for why the company is cutting 14,000 employees? Not money. Not even AI, but “culture.” The layoff announcement ﻿this week was “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now. It’s culture,” Jassy said in response to an analyst question on the company’s earnings call Thursday. Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion. Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.” Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings. “It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.” Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers.

Title: Amazon VP says his division is hiring and promoting based on employees' AI usage

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Want to get ahead in Amazon's home security unit? You'd better be using AI. In July, Business Insider viewed an email from Jamie Siminoff, Amazon's VP of product who runs the home security division. In it, Siminoff said that all promotion applications would require employees to list how they were using AI. Siminoff doubled down on that position in an interview with Business Insider last week while promoting his book "Ding Dong." "I would go even deeper than that," Siminoff said. "We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job." Siminoff said that he wants to incentivize his team to use the technology more. "The promotion process is the only real incentive that I can give to a team, because that's how they're going to get paid," he said. "If you are creating more leverage for the company than everyone else, then yeah, that should be how you get promoted." Siminoff spoke with Business Insider before Amazon cut 14,000 jobs on Tuesday. On a recent earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were "not really financially driven," nor were they "really AI-driven, not right now at least," but they were rather about "culture." Siminoff declined to provide an additional comment after the layoffs. At the time of Business Insider's July reporting on Jassy's memo, an Amazon representative said that the change to promotional applications did not apply to the whole company, only to those in the RBKS division — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk. Siminoff cofounded Ring, the video doorbell and home security company. He pitched the "Shark Tank" investors in 2013 but walked away without a deal. Five years later, the company was acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion. After leaving Amazon in 2023, Siminoff returned in his new role as VP of product in April 2025. He refocused Ring on crime-fighting and home security, and added more AI features to the product lineup. In his interview with Business Insider, Siminoff also said that he was asking about AI usage during hiring interviews: "AI in, AI out. It is like a broken record." Asked what an AI-related interview question might sound like, Siminoff said it differed between roles. For example, an engineer might be asked which tools they know how to use, he said. "I think it's the mentality of: are you leaning into AI first?" Siminoff said. "We don't want someone who's like, 'Oh, AI, I know how to use that, I'll use it if you tell me to.'" The ideal candidate already uses tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to solve daily problems, he added. "You're thinking that way natively," Siminoff said. "That's the people I want now." Jump to

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. UPDATE: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is revising the company's explanation for its mass layoffs this week, which could be frustrating for the 14,000 people who lost their jobs. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven—not right now, at least," Jassy said on a Thursday earnings call. "It’s culture." Jassy says Amazon's growth in the past few years left it with too many people, locations, and types of businesses. He reiterated the company's desire to operate like "the world's largest startup, [which] means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly." That partially conflicts with the memo Amazon published on the day it announced layoffs. Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, also mentioned being the "world's largest startup" and stressed the "importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership." However, Galetti also specifically called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote. "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." Amazon stock is surging today, up 12% after it reported stellar Q3 earnings, beating expectations, CNBC reports. Original Story 10/28:Amazon today confirmed plans to lay off 14,000 people in corporate roles amid a continued push on AI, though more cuts could be in store for 2026. The company is "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets," Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, wrote in a company-wide email that it also published online. Galetti's memo comes after Reuters reported yesterday that Amazon planned to cut "as many as 30,000 corporate jobs." She didn't address that number, but said Amazon expects to find "additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains" next year. Reuters reports the cuts will primarily affect those in HR, devices, services, and operations. Employees will hear today if they are affected. Amazon will offer "most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Those who cannot find a new role at Amazon will receive "transition support, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more," Galetti says. Some are already posting about being laid off on social media. "After years of pouring my heart into this company and its people, it’s surreal to say that this chapter is now closed," a senior recruiter with Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios wrote on LinkedIn. Usually this type of corporate cut would occur when a company is doing poorly, but Amazon had $18 billion in profit in the latest quarter, The New York Times reports. It's also increased spending on AI data centers. Amazon acknowledged this in its employee memo, citing its ambitions to move even faster in AI. "Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well," Galetti wrote. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)." Amazon plans to "operate like the world's largest startup," she added, a phrase CEO Andy Jassy first used in a September 2024 memo to employees in which he also announced a "bureaucracy mailbox," where employees could forward examples of "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out." Amazon also laid off approximately 27,000 people a few years ago. As of July, it had 1.55 million employees. Last week, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division, also citing the need to move faster, so even those who work in AI might not be safe in today's unpredictable tech climate. Last week, The New York Times reported that Amazon would ramp up the use of automation in its warehouses in the coming years, which would allow it to hire about 600,000 fewer human employees. Amazon pushed back on that characterization, however, and pointed to the 250,000 seasonal jobs it will once again add for the holiday rush.

Title: Amazon shares soar 11% on strong cloud growth, easing investor fears over AI spending

Shares in Amazon soared about 11% to reach a new record high Friday after the firm reported its strongest cloud growth since 2022 – easing investor fears that industry giants have been overspending on AI. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had soared 1.2% Friday morning as of about 10:50 a.m. ET, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Averaged jumped 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. On Thursday, investors sent shares in Meta and Microsoft sliding about 12% and 3%, respectively, after both companies announced plans to hike capital expenditures on AI. Major stock indexes are still set to the end the week higher. The Dow and Nasdaq are on track for their longest streaks of monthly gains since January 2018. Amazon on Thursday revealed it had notched its fastest cloud-computing growth since 2022 and announced plans to raise its data-center capacity. Revenue in its cloud unit jumped 20.2% in the most recent quarter – beating Wall Street estimates of 18.1%. The company is currently the leading provider of cloud infrastructure tech. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months,” CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday. It reported earnings per share of $1.95, above estimates of $1.57, and revenue of $180.17 billion, beating expectations of $177.8 billion. For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects to bring in sales of $206 billion to $213 billion, above what analysts were expecting. It also expects operating income of between $21 billion and $26 billion, compared to estimates of $23.8 billion. Like other tech giants this week, Amazon hiked its planned capital expenditures for this year. It now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025 – up from $118 billion. The company plans to spend even more next year. Just this week, the firm launched Project Rainier, an $11 billion data center in rural Indiana. But Amazon has been focused on cutting costs in other areas, launching a round of 14,000 job cuts this week. In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office workforce – over the coming weeks. During an earnings call Thursday, Jassy said the layoffs were not “financially driven,” but rather a “culture” move as the firm aims to cut down on bureaucracy. Apple on Thursday also reported upbeat quarterly earnings and a strong forecast for December. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

While the shares initially jumped Friday morning, they later fell about 0.3% since its sales and revenue in China — one of the company’s largest markets — missed expectations. However, it reported earnings per share of $1.85, above estimates of $1.77, and revenue of $102.47 billion, beating expectations of $102.24 billion. The company expects revenue to soar 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter – well above Wall Street estimates of 6%, said Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh. A “double-digit” increase in iPhone sales from the previous year is expected to lead the revenue beat, he added. That’s thanks to an “off the chart” global response to Apple’s new iPhone 17 lineup, CEO Tim Cook said, adding that store traffic is up significantly on a yearly basis. In the most recent quarter, Apple reported $27.46 billion in net income, up from $14.29 billion in the same period last year. A one-time tax charge pushed last year’s figure lower. For fiscal year 2025, Apple reported $416 billion in total revenue – up 6% from the previous year. Sales in the most recent quarter jumped 8% from the same time last year. Total iPhone revenue jumped 6% to $49.03 billion. The new iPhone 17 models went on sale on Sept. 19, so only about a week of these sales were included in the quarterly earnings report. Analysts had expected $50.19 billion in iPhone sales. Cook said the miss was because several models were affected by supply constraints. The company’s iPad business came in flat, with $6.95 billion in sales. Services – which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions, App Store charges and warranties for hardware – rose 15% to $24.97 billion in sales. Its “Other Products” category, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Vision Pro, dipped slightly to $9.04 billion in sales. Its Mac business also jumped 13% to $8.72 billion in sales. Cook said the company had not hiked prices due to tariffs. Instead, Apple is “just absorbing the tariffs in gross margin.” A gross margin of 47.2% beat estimates of 46.4%. Advertisement

Title: AI will accelerate the end of brick and mortar’s reign: Amazon CEO

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The domination of e-commerce is inevitable and will only come faster thanks to the emerging technology, even if physical stores represent opportunity for now, Andy Jassy told analysts Thursday. Amazon sees “a significant opportunity” for growth in its existing physical stores, which are centered on grocery — at least for now. The e-commerce giant announced plans to expand same-day deliveries of fresh groceries, now in 1,000 U.S. cities, to 2,300 by the end of the year. Even that could be seen as an extension of e-commerce as much of physical retail. In any case, despite the current dominance of brick and mortar, e-commerce will ultimately take over, and AI is making that happen even faster than before, Andy Jassy told analysts on a Thursday earnings call. “I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores,” he said. “That equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that.” Physical retail remains a small, if growing, portion of Amazon’s retail operation. In Q3 online store sales rose 10% year over year to $67.4 billion, while physical stores sales rose 7% to $5.6 billion, according to financial filings Thursday. Overall product sales rose 9.6% to $74.1 billion. There’s a price to all of that e-commerce, as worldwide shipping costs rose 8% to $25.4 billion. Several analysts noted that Amazon is taking share in retail. But other aspects of the retail business are growing faster than either the online or offline channel. Seller services sales grew 12% to $42.5 billion; advertising grew 24% to $17.7 billion; and subscription services grew 11% to $12.6 billion. Whatever the impact of AI on the retail landscape, there’s no doubt it’s fueling Amazon’s tech operation, and Amazon’s tech operation is fueling profits. Most analyst reports released Thursday and Friday focused on the company’s AWS unit, where Q3 net sales rose 20% year on year to over $33 billion. Even with estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs, AWS segment operating income rose over 9% to $11.4 billion. Overall operating income, including two special charges — $2.5 billion from a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs — was essentially flat from last year at $17.4 billion. “Clearly AWS continues to drive the bus here, with acceleration in growth and better-than-expected operating margin in the segment,” William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden said in a Friday client note. The 14,000 layoffs confirmed by Amazon earlier in the week are also tied to AI, as the company said it anticipates a need for fewer people as generative AI continues to advance.

Title: Slog AM: Seattle's Soggy Halloween, Prince Andrew Is a Prince No More, Trump Demands That GOP Kill Filibuster

Happy Halloween, you little ghouls: I have compiled an especially spooky, scary morning news for you. Except, not really. These are just the regular headlines. Because every day is hell. The Scariest Thing This Halloween: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the recent 14,000-person tech layoffs (2,303 of which hit Seattle Amazonians). He said the reason wasn't financial nor was it about AI. Instead, it was culture. He said the company grew fast, hired faster, and now had too many "layers." This is not the way to operate, apparently. With so many people the company can't "be flat and... move fast." The culture Jassy speaks of is this: Amazon is not in the business of people, but of course, in the business of profit. Too many people bogs down the profit. This year, Amazon reported $180.2 billion and Amazon Web Services reported $33 billion in sales. It is never enough. After the layoffs, Amazon's stock ticked up 14%. Watch Out, This Could Be You: Man Wouldn't Have Worn Costume To Work If He'd Known He Was Getting Laid Off [image or embed] Another Halloween Fright: Traffic will be bad for those of you stuck in your little cars. Take a bus or a train to your Halloween party. The I-5 Ship Canal Bridge construction will continue this weekend in the southbound lanes. Rain won't stop that mess. Rain could stop the planned construction on I-405. If it doesn't, then prepare for multiple northbound lane closures between Northeast 124th Street and Northeast 160th Street. Annnnnd all westbound lanes on I-90 from Mercer Island to Seattle are closing Friday night through early Saturday morning. The real horror: Halloween is the day the most child pedestrian deaths happen in the US. Don't drive your stupid car tonight in the stupid rain and hit any stupid kids. I'm warning you! Happy Halloween!!! Reminder that Halloween is the most dangerous day of the year for pedestrians, so: 1. Don’t drive2. If you must drive, slow down!3. Longer term, advocate for more walkability where you live[image or embed] Something Wicked This Way Comes: Trick or Treaters beware. An atmospheric river-like weather system will unleash a soggy hell on this evening's festivities and the weekend that follows. It'll be gushers only in your candy pail. Cause of the rain. Darkness Falls: The clocks roll back starting Sunday morning at 2 a.m. Winter is readying its cold, spindly fingers around our necks. After this weekend, sunset will fall at a dastardly 4:49 p.m. In Skeleton News: Flava Flav has been anointed the official hype man for the US bobsled and skeleton teams in the 2026 Winter Olympics. In case you, like me, forgot there are Olympics next year, there are and they will be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Stripping Prince Andrew: No! No! Not like that. Well, a little like that? Britain's King Charles has started the process of severing his brother's ties with the monarchy. The now-almost-ex prince has been mired in controversy over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal of being friends with a serial sex pest creep reached new heights recently after Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir alleged Andrew assaulted her when she was a teen. Andrew denied these allegations. Not enough! No princely titles and no more lodging at royal estates for you, buddy. Trump Calls for the End of the Filibuster: President Donald Trump would like the shutdown to end. Not through compromise, of course. On Truth Social, Trump screamed, "INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER." Overcoming a filibuster in the full Senate requires 60 votes. The Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. To abolish the filibuster as a whole would change how the Senate does debate. Democrats continue to block the measure that would fund the government because they're fighting for the reinstatement of healthcare subsidies so Americans don't suffer even more exorbitant insurance costs. Trump called getting rid of the filibuster the Senate GOP's "TRUMP CARD." The GOP fears eliminating the filibuster could hurt them if the Democrats ever regain control of Congress. Whatever happens, it'll be too late to save SNAP benefits before they run dry on Nov. 1. The government shutdown has lasted 31 days. It will at least last a few more. Senators left D.C. without making any deals. Millions of people will have to deal with their SNAP benefits lapsing tomorrow. However, there is a shred of hope. A federal judge from Massachusetts will decide Friday whether the Trump administration must continue to fund food stamps during the shutdown. Justice? Some Senators couldn't get home last night after their long day of not re-opening the government. Why? Shutdown-induced delays at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Melissa Kills 49: Hurricane Melissa killed 30 people in Haiti, and 20 people are still missing. In Jamaica, Melissa's death toll reached 19. The now-Category 2 storm steered mostly clear of Bermuda, which experienced her wrath as a strong tropical storm. Illinois Advocates Sue Feds: Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center have sued Immigrations and Custom Enforcement for its treatment of detainees. According to the suit, ICE officials have blocked detainees from contacting lawyers, deprived them of food and medical treatment, and forced them to sign papers relinquishing their rights.

We Have the Louvre Heist at Home: Thieves nabbed more than 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California's off-site storage facility. They stole metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets, scrimshaw walrus tusks, and 20th century sports memorabilia. We are in a heist heyday! A Long Read: Rich liberal family hires part-time live-in nanny for their child at their upstate New York home. The nanny gets kind of weird, then refuses to leave. I hate when this happens! A Kentucky woman opened a package expecting the medicine she had ordered. Instead, she found "arms and fingers." The county coroner said there had been a mishap with "an airline company, a freight company, and a courier." The coroner picked up the arms and fingers from the woman and intended to return them to the courier so the arms and fingers can go to their intended recipient. It is unclear who ordered the arms and fingers and for what purpose. Likely, not for medicine. Viva la France: A 77-year-old French cyclist fell 130 feet into a ravine and survived for three days thanks to the bottles of red wine he was toting in his grocery bags. A Song for Your Halloween: It is really the only song to listen to today. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger. She likes covering anything she finds fun, weird, or interesting. You can find a lot of that in her column, Play Date. She hates dentists and loves costume parties.

Title: The Weekly Closeout: Lululemon links up with the NFL, Parade shuts down

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The activewear brand is launching an apparel collection surrounding the league’s teams, while the intimates brand abruptly ceased operations after six years. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From retail’s onslaught of layoffs to how much Walmart captured from SNAP grocery spending last year, here’s our closeout for the week. Lululemon throws a Hail Mary As it navigates a rare tough patch, Lululemon is hoping a partnership with the NFL can inject some momentum into the business. The athleisure giant on Monday announced it would release an “elevated apparel collection” surrounding the NFL’s 32 teams. The product line, released Tuesday, pulls from Lululemon’s Steady State, Define, Scuba and Align styles and crosses both men’s and women’s. The assortment features both apparel and accessories. Products will be available at the NFL Shop website, Fanatics and team retail locations, including stadium stores. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, said the retailer was “thrilled” to be a part of the weekly NFL ritual. “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel, it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family,” Burgoyne said. Analysts aren’t as rosy on the partnership. Jefferies analysts this week called the decision “another questionable move that doesn't make sense” and said it hinted at “deeper strategic confusion.” The move mirrors others aimed at attracting young shoppers, Jefferies wrote, but that risks alienating its core female shopper. “It remains unclear how selling NFL apparel fits into [Lululemon’s] long-term vision,” Jefferies analysts said. “Is this a one-off licensing play, or a signal of a permanent shift toward mass-market, logo-driven product? There is little evidence that these moves will drive durable, profitable growth.” Gen Z-focused intimates brand Parade shuts down DTC intimates brand Parade has shut down after six years, the company announced in an email to customers over the weekend. “Parade was created with the intention to welcome you all to express yourself in full-spectrum color with confidence, and we hope we were able to create that space for you,” the email read. The brand was founded by Cami Téllez and launched in 2019. In 2023, Parade was acquired by Ariela & Associates International. Over the years, the brand expanded beyond its intimates roots, launching into swimwear and activewear. In its message this week, Parade directed customers to Ariela’s other brands, including Curvy Couture and Smart&Sexy. Bacon the holidays better It might be Halloween, but companies already have their sites set on other celebrations. Dunkin' will start selling its holiday season lineup on Wednesday. This year features a Cookie Butter Cloud Latte and a Berry Sangria Refresher, along with returning favorites Peppermint Mocha and Toasted White Chocolate Signature Lattes. Food offerings include a new Raspberry Striped Croissant and two bacon jam options — the Ultimate Bacon Jam Breakfast Sandwich and Bacon Jam Grilled Cheese. The company is also offering limited-edition packaging designs. “After seeing fans make their own Cookie Butter hacks, we knew it was time to make it official with the Cookie Butter Cloud Latte,” Anthony Epter, vice president of menu innovation at Dunkin’, said in a statement. “And because we know how busy the season can be, we created our Bacon Jam lineup to give guests something satisfying and easy to enjoy on the go.” 26% That’s the percentage Walmart captured in SNAP grocery spend over the past year, according to a Numerator report. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food benefits to low-income families to support their grocery budgets, will not be issued to tens of millions of Americans on Saturday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. SNAP shoppers spend an average of $2,653 annually at Walmart, per the report. A whirlwind of layoffs The past week or so has brought a downpour of layoffs. Amazon is reducing its corporate workforce by around 14,000 with some outlets reporting more layoffs to come, while Puma will eliminate around 900 corporate jobs (adding to the 500 roles it cut earlier this year). Children’s clothing store Carter’s will lay off 300, Target cut 1,800 jobs and UPS has eliminated about 34,000 positions so far this year.

Title: How some of the world's biggest tech companies stacked up during earnings season

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Happy Halloween! Keep an eye out for AI-inspired costumes tonight. (Just good luck trying to automate trick-or-treating!) In case you missed it, I had a fantastic discussion with Eugene Kim and Aki Ito yesterday about the Amazon layoffs and its wider impact across corporate America. Luckily, you can watch a replay of the whole discussion here. In today's big story, tech earnings have finally wrapped. Here's what you need to know. What's on deck: Markets: The former McKinsey executive who is Zohran Mamdani's bridge to NYC's C-suite. Tech: Who got rich from Navan's IPO? Business: The era of the never-ending layoff might be here. But first, give me the CliffNotes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. If you blinked, you might have missed it. Earnings season hit Big Tech, and there's a lot to unpack. (And a lot of AI spending going on.) Five of the world's most important companies provided updates on their businesses over the course of two days. To quickly catch you up on how things shook out, here's a rundown on the main takeaways from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. But first, a quick plug for my colleague Alistair Barr's newsletter. Tech Memo is a must-subscribe if you even have a slight interest in the industry, so do yourself a favor and click here. Ok, let's dive in. Alphabet: Hot on ChatGPT's heels. Look out, OpenAI. Here comes Gemini. Google's chatbot now has 650 million monthly active users. That's about a 44% jump from just a few months ago. Sure, it still trails the behemoth that is ChatGPT, which has a staggering 800 million weekly active users. But the growth shows Gemini is building momentum, and especially with the youths. Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app, told BI's Hugh Langley there has been a big demographic shift to younger users. That's thanks to its viral image editor Nano Banana. Microsoft: Spend, spend, spend. Spending big on AI infrastructure was already a massive theme in tech heading into earnings, and Microsoft certainly didn't stray from the path. An internal memo from CFO Amy Hood seen by BI's Ashley Stewart highlighted the company's record $34.9 billion infrastructure spending to meet AI demand this quarter. Investors aren't necessarily buying it, as concerns are growing about whether all this money will lead to some ROI. Meta: Oh, you think that's a lot of tech spending? Hold my beer. Meta has never shied away from its intent to spend big on AI. That proved true this week when it bumped its estimate for infrastructure spend this year to between $70 billion and $72 billion. The number raised plenty of questions for Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps his answers didn't land quite the right way. Meta's stock tumbled more than 11% on Thursday. Meta's commitment to AI is clear, but loyalty to a trend is a fickle thing at the tech giant. Remember the good old metaverse? It got zero mentions from Meta executives on Wednesday's call. Apple: Big trouble in China. The iPhone maker delivered an earnings beat, with revenue growing 8% year over year. However, things weren't so bright in China, an important market for Apple. Revenue was actually down compared to a year ago, and it's not like 2024 was a banner year for Apple in the country either. Amazon: Layoffs? What layoffs? Only a few days removed from cutting 14,000 corporate employees, Amazon reported some big wins in earnings. There was huge growth, particularly when it came to its somewhat beleaguered cloud unit. As for those layoffs, CEO Andy Jassy offered some clarity about the motivation. According to Jassy, it wasn't about AI or even cost savings. It was because they didn't fit the culture, he said. 1. Meet Zohran Mamdani's CEO whisperer. Former McKinsey executive and Ayn Rand fan Yasser Salem has become the democratic socialist candidate's bridge to New York's C-suite. Salem hopes to turn skeptics into partners and told BI that he has met with over 70 CEOs to discuss their concerns. 2. Hedge funds are on track for a banner year. Despite an array of macroeconomic headwinds, the industry is set to have its best annual showing since the pandemic, according to fund administrator Citco. Multistrategy funds are leading the way, with an average return of 19.3%. 3. JPMorgan wants everyone in its 300,000 workforce to become AI pros. America's biggest bank is rolling out a firmwide AI training push, but it'll affect different workers in different ways, chief analytics officer Derek Waldron said in an interview with McKinsey. The multi-pronged strategy is helping people get comfortable, he said. 1. Navan finally makes its (public) debut. The travel and expense management company has become the largest to test the IPO waters during a government shutdown. BI calculated the numbers — and these are the big VC winners. 2. Use AI, but don't depend on it. Many bosses are encouraging workers to lean in on AI, but some are also worried workers could forget how to do their jobs without it. 3. AI is starting to take a bite out of Wikipedia's traffic. Wiki reported its traffic is down 8% in the last few months when compared to the same time last year, and AI summaries and chatbots that aggregate its data are largely to blame. BI's Katie Notopoulos explores whether Wikipedia is in trouble or not. 1. The world's most important economic relationship just got a reset. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping emerged from their first IRL meeting in six years with warmth and progress. Beneath the diplomatic niceties, three major business takeaways stood out. 2. The rise of the rolling layoff. Companies like Amazon and Paramount Skydance have conducted multiple rounds of layoffs recently, leaving some employees relieved that they held onto their jobs but fearing they might be next. That can be pretty bad for morale and productivity. Here's why companies do it anyway. 3. Slop bowl stocks slump. Chipotle's stock fell 18% missing consensus Q3 revenue estimates. The fast-food chain revealed a significant decline in customer traffic among Gen Z and millennials, which prompted a reduced outlook. Competitors Sweetgreen and Cava also saw their stocks fall.

Title: Another tech giant’s gaming ambitions bite the dust | Opinion

The gutting of Amazon Games is tragic, but arguably a long time coming; like many tech giants, the company critically underestimated the complexity of succeeding in this market The gutting of Amazon's gaming division as part of a sweeping round of job cuts across the company is another blow to the already grim state of the games industry's employment market and career stability. It's not clear how many of the 14,000 jobs the giant company is cutting will be in its gaming subsidiaries, but it's flagged "significant role reductions" and a major turn away from developing big-budget titles. As awful as the impact of any major layoffs may be, this one has been a long time coming. By that I mean no disrespect to the no doubt hard-working and talented people whose lives are being dealt hammer blows by these strategic decisions made far above their pay grades; Amazon’s studios' games featured a lot of genuinely great work, perhaps most notably on New World, an MMORPG title that’s now among those now slated for shutdown. Strategically, however, Amazon's entire flirtation with the notion of being a games company has been a decades-long comedy of errors. The world's largest and most powerful retailer and Cloud services operator has at every turn failed to leverage its market advantages or produce a coherent strategy that lasted for more than about five minutes. It's a testament to the incredible strength and growth of Amazon overall – driven first by its online retail business and more recently by Amazon Web Services – that the directionless bungling of its games-related efforts has survived so many restructures, U-turns, product cancellations, and leadership changes. However much was being spent on games, it could be waved away as a rounding error during the boom years – but the music was bound to stop sooner or later. With Amazon now battening down the hatches across the board, gaming's blessed existence as a muddled, loss-making hobby for the company has seemingly come to an end. What's extraordinary in all this is just how little Amazon has to show for all the time and effort it has expended on gaming. The company is of course one of the biggest gaming retailers in the world simply by virtue of being Amazon, but has failed to leverage that into any meaningful position in digital gaming. So poor has the company's performance on that front been that when a LinkedIn post from former Prime Gaming VP Ethan Evans surfaced in February, reflecting on the company's failure to disrupt Steam's dominance of the PC digital distribution market. The most common reaction was genuine surprise at the discovery that Amazon had actually been trying to compete with Steam in the first place. Everything Amazon did in this space was just so fragmented and temporary. Prime Gaming actually included a bunch of free games for Prime subscribers, but it's not clear how many subscribers even knew that – and the games you redeemed there were generally provided through third-party stores like GoG or Epic Games Store, not added to any kind of Amazon Games library. That service fluctuated between trying to be an actual games subscription service and instead being an offering of free currency packs for popular F2P games; now it's been folded into the Luna game streaming service, though the average Amazon customer would be hard pressed to notice that either service exists, let alone that they’ve merged. The contrast with how Amazon has approached Prime Video – a service that it seemingly genuinely believes in, with support right up to the top of the company, even when it's flinging ill-advised billions at Lord of the Rings shows nobody asked for – is instructive. When you search for a movie on Amazon, Prime Video results are front and centre; if you want to buy an actual DVD or Blu-Ray, you'll have to click your way through several screens letting you know that it’s available to watch for free, to rent, or to buy on the streaming service. Search for a game on Amazon, though, and you often wouldn’t get anything of the sort; at times it was quite possible to buy a game that was already available to you for free on Prime Gaming or Luna without ever once seeing information to that effect. For all the strategic errors that were undoubtedly made on the development and publishing side of Amazon Gaming, I don't think the company can really be faulted for failing to become the major publisher they wished to be. That's an exceptionally difficult thing to do and is well outside Amazon's core competencies (to wit, running a cloud platform, and dabbling in a little light retail on the side). The fact that some games – like New World – actually did turn out well and create a passionate, if not huge, fanbase is not a bad showing on that front, albeit apparently not a commercially viable business unit either. The total failure to leverage the company's scale and its dominance of cloud and consumer-facing retail into any kind of foothold in digital distribution or online gaming services, however, is almost impressive; especially when you consider that the company apparently thought it was mounting serious competition to Steam for all this time. As much as there were individual managers and executives responsible for the decision making at Amazon, and some of them made really bad choices along the way, I think it's more instructive to think about what happened here in terms of structural failure. After all, Amazon isn't alone in this failure. It's only a few years since we saw Google abruptly (if entirely predictably) throw its hands in the air and give up on its own once-grand gaming ambitions, with the Stadia streaming service being ditched and full refunds being issued for hardware and games for the platform. That's two of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" who have essentially burned their hands on the gaming stove in the past five years alone. Scale, finances, and tech dominance simply aren't enough to make it in what is, essentially, a creative industry that sometimes cosplays as a tech sector on weekends. Google wasn't willing to make the long-term commitment required to build a business in this sector, while Amazon seemingly lacked the coherent vision and high-level support required to leverage its actual competitive advantages on behalf of its gaming ambitions. At their core, though, I'd argue that both failures boil down to the same root cause. The cultures of both companies were simply ill-suited to the kind of management style that's needed to nursemaid complex, long-term, expensive creative projects to a successful fruition. The kind of intensive internal competition that has been a catalyst for success for many tech companies is disastrous for creative industries, where constructive collaboration always yields far better results in the long-term than Darwinian competition. With tens upon tens of billions of dollars currently floating around the games industry for gigantic acquisitions and mergers, the collapse of Amazon's gaming ambitions may be a very timely reminder that there are some things money can't buy – especially in the absence of a coherent strategy to spend it.

Title: North Road Restructures International As President Jan Frouman Exits Amid Layoffs In London

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Change is once again afoot at Peter Chernin’s North Road Company with international President Jan Frouman exiting after three years as part of a restructure in London. Frouman, who left last month, is one of a number who has exited North Road’s London base, we understand. Several more junior staff were laid off. Frouman will not be replaced like-for-like and his place leading North Road’s international scripted efforts will be taken by L.A.-based North Road President Scott Manson along with the North Road scripted teams and Chernin Entertainment. The UK hub of North Road label Kinetic Content, which opened earlier this year in London under Too Hot to Handle co-creator Laura Gibson, is staying put and continues to build, insiders said. Related Stories Executives Chernin Entertainment Elevates David Ready To President Of Film As Jenno Topping Inks New Deal With Company News Caroline Hollick Exits North Road After A Year Frouman, a former Red Arrow Studios boss and head of Will Smith’s Westbrook International, was hired by Chernin in 2022 as Chernin formed North Road and paid $200M for Red Arrow Studios’ U.S. assets including Love is Blind producer Kinetic. Frouman’s LinkedIn indicates that he left North Road last month and has since become a strategic advisor to Israeli studio Sipur, a long-term partner of North Road’s. North Road declined comment. Watch on Deadline Frouman was President of international at North Road since its inception and ran the operation from the UK capital. During his tenure, North Road worked on splashy international co-pros including Israeli shows Bad Boy and Heart of a Killer (both with Sipur), along with Brazil’s Suture. It also bought Turkish indie Karga Seven and Mexico’s Perro Azul, while overseeing the opening of Kinetic’s UK hub. North Road was consistently rumored to be in the running for bigger international M&A plays such as All3Media but these did not come to pass and at times things have felt slow-going internationally, while high-profile executives such as Kristin Jones and Caroline Hollick exited during Frouman’s tenure. A number of his support staff have left in the past few weeks, we are told. In the U.S., North Road is behind the likes of Ford v Ferrari, Love is Blind and The Last Dance. Upcoming projects include The Body and Man on Fire for Netflix. The news comes as yet another tortuorous round of layoffs hits the U.S., most recently at Paramount-Skydance, Amazon and Fifth Season, with redundancies expected to hit Paramount internationally imminently.

Title: International Insider: Doctor… Who?; Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest; Steve Coogan Settlement
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/10/doctor-who-disney-deal-international-insider-1236602867/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T13:00:00Z

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the clocks have gone back, but we move forwards. Max Goldbart here taking you through the week’s headlines. Sign up here. Doctor… Who? No Disney regeneration: One of this decade’s splashiest industry deals came to an abrupt end this week, as Disney confirmed what we’d all been waiting for and killed its Doctor Who co-production pact with the BBC after just two seasons, having spent circa-£150M ($200M) on the sci-fi series thus far. Deadline had teased this happening as long ago as last summer, and the reality, per our deep dive this week, was that Disney appeared to have regretted signing on the dotted line not long after it did so in 2022. At that time, the streamers were splashing the cash as they looked to beef up their platforms to take on the might of Netflix, but the open check book era ended as quickly as it began, as Bob Iger re-took the Disney reins and started scaling back. The show never quite rated for Disney+, neither did it garner awards buzz, and the period has also collided with something of a “woke” backlash as MAGA politics seeped into commissioning at the very top, which may have had an impact on a series that unashamedly places diversity front and center. All in all, Doctor Who is a quintessentially British show that was maybe not quite primed for a mainstream American Disney audience. For now, the BBC needs to carve a new path for The Doctor, one that will see its budget slashed by at least half unless it can find a new American partner, amid question marks over how long showrunner Russell T Davies will remain in the saddle (he is penning an Xmas special for 2026 but no news yet on further seasons). Keep an eye on this one – it’s been quite the ride in the TARDIS. Related Stories Executives YouTube TV Calls Disney "Unnecessarily Aggressive" In Carriage Talks, With "Antiquated View" Of Pay-TV Economics Executives YouTube TV Is Out To "Eliminate Competition", Disney Execs Tell Employees In Carriage Fight Update Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest Watch on Deadline IDFA sparks debate: The International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) stoked debate this week over its decision to exclude Israeli state-backed organizations and films from every aspect of its 2025 edition amid growing international condemnation of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The event – which is the biggest documentary festival in Europe, if not the world – is the first major film festival to make such a move. It marks a blow for Israel’s mainly left-leaning documentary community, which has found itself increasingly isolated on the world stage following the launch of a boycott pledge in September, which has since been signed by close to 2,000 high-profile figures from the film world. IDFA’s new Artistic Director, Isabel Arrate Fernandez, told Deadline that the decision to bar Israel state funded orgs and films was not tied to that pledge, but rather in keeping with the festival’s new ‘Principles and Guidelines’. The decision has been greeted with dismay by many Israeli documentary professionals who point to their tradition of documenting and critiquing Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians, as well as the efforts of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to shut them down. “We will continue to make films, even if we have to film them on our cell phones and screen them in our living rooms,” Michal Weits, the Artistic Director of IDFA-barred festival DocAviv, told Deadline. Steve Coogan’s Settlement “Defamation David and Goliath”: In the world of entertainment, truth and fiction often blur. When this results in a courtroom battle, the public (and press) tends to pay attention. Following on from the high-profile Baby Reindeer suit (still to be resolved), headlines came Monday when Steve Coogan’s Baby Cow and Pathé paid “substantial damages” to a university professor who accused them of defaming his character in a pic about the search for King Richard III’s remains. A title card has also been added to The Lost King’s credits noting the portrayal of Richard Taylor is fictional. Taylor said representation of him and his behavior towards Philippa Langley (played by Sally Hawkins) in the movie was damaging. Coogan and co had to pay out, but the film’s creator and star was adamant that he didn’t really do anything wrong, as he pointed out in a Guardian op ed that the film has barely been altered and that potential star witness Langley was too ill to attend court. These fallouts are always interesting to follow as they raise questions around poetic licence, fictional representation and that good old fashioned “based on a true story” disclaimer that we audiences are oh so familiar with. Taylor’s action and Coogan’s response could set a precedent for many a movie to come. Japanese Animation Goes Big “New Cool Japan Strategy”: Good news for Japanese animation this week as our Asia expert Liz Shackleton brought news of record revenue. Last year, Japan’s animation industry grew by 14.8% to hit a whopping ¥3.8TR ($25BN), a mighty figure for an industry that has long punched well above its weight with fans from all over the world. Encouragingly, the report from the Association of Japanese Animations found that much of the rise came from overseas markets, which accounted for 56% of the total. Overseas revenue for Japanese animation first overtook local in the early pandemic era, colliding with global streaming platforms starting to accelerate distribution of Japanese anime overseas. Japan’s government is positioning anime and related media as a core industry under its ‘New Cool Japan Strategy’, setting a rather ambitious target of reaching ¥20TR ($130B) by 2033. Paramount Layoffs Never painless: We all know that M&A is never painless. This week, pain hit the newly-minted Paramount-Skydance, as around 1,000 employees were let go – mainly in Hollywood – a move that will likely impact international over the coming weeks. Few departments were spared, with staffers let go across news, movies, TV and back office. As Insider goes to press, the international fallout is beginning to be felt. Along with 100 layoffs in the U.S., CBS News is closing its bureau in Johannesburg, and its Race & Culture Unit – established in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd – is being eliminated. Meanwhile, we revealed last night that Lisa Kramer, the LA-based President, International TV Licensing at Paramount Global Content Distribution, will exit. The popular distribution executive was a mainstay at international markets and will be sorely missed. Long-serving SVP, Comms, Jennifer Weingroff, and Tony Augi, finance head for the distribution business, have also been let go. Paramount-Skydance wasn’t the only one making deep cuts. Amazon MGM Studios and Fifth Season have also initiated redundancy programs, as has North Road in London, with international president Jan Frouman exiting. With the spotlight on a Warner Bros. Discovery sale and Netflix throwing its exploratory hat in the ring, there could be more pain to come as media giants continue to synergise. The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: Quentin Tarantino has landed his biggest role in nearly 30 years in feature Only What We Carry opposite Simon Pegg, Sofia Boutella and Charlotte Gainsbourg. 🌶️ And another One: Rita Ora and Ella Purnell are leading the voice cast of Harald Zwart’s animated viking girls adventure ViQueens. 🤖 New column klaxon: Jake is penning Rendering, reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz alongside our regular TechLine newsletter.

Title: Amazon’s latest layoffs are not about AI replacing jobs
URL: https://www.verdict.co.uk/amazon-job-lay-offs/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:36:54Z
Full Content:
On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced it would lay off around 14,000 of its corporate workforce, potentially increasing to 10% of the total global corporate workforce or more than 30,000 employees in 2026. In the announcement, senior vice president of the company’s HR team, Beth Galetti, emphasised the role of AI in changing company operations, stating, “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Some have taken this to mean that Amazon is replacing corporate workers with AI tools. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more However, the truth is not so straightforward. AI cannot directly replace Amazon’s corporate employees because it is not advanced enough yet to replace entire job roles. However, skyrocketing demand for AI solutions, combined with other factors like the tech hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed to Amazon’s decision to focus on maintaining financial health while increasing its AI spending. Accelerated demand for digital solutions, ecommerce, video streaming, and other online services during the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a hiring spree across the tech industry. At the time, Big Tech saw the increased use of digital services by businesses and consumers as the new normal. This led Amazon to invest heavily in its technology business, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), and grow its workforce significantly. In 2021, Amazon added more than 300,000 full- and part-time workers, taking its total headcount to 1.6 million people. Based on the October 28 announcement, it is estimated that around 80% of the roles cut are in Amazon’s entertainment arm and in operations (HR, recruitment, advertising, marketing, and ecommerce functions) across other Amazon businesses. While these roles are heavily at risk of being automated by AI agents, there is no clear evidence that Amazon is replacing these roles with AI. In reality, Amazon is doubling down on its AI investments as a key corporate priority and needs to cut costs to maintain profitability. Beth Galetti’s statement highlighted the company’s desire to be “organised more leanly.” It should come as no surprise that Amazon is betting heavily on AI. According to Goldman Sachs, AI will drive a 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030. As the world’s largest public cloud provider, AWS is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for data center usage. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. AWS is Amazon’s most profitable business unit, making up 58% or around $40bn of Amazon’s total operating income in 2024 despite contributing just 17% of net sales. Despite this, its profit does not cover anywhere near the amount of investment Amazon requires to fulfill AI data center demand. The company intends to spend as much as $118bn in capital expenditure in 2025 alone. To keep up in the race for AI dominance, Amazon needs to increase investments in building data centers, develop graphics processing units (GPUs) with improved computing power, and buy GPUs when it cannot manufacture them fast enough. To do this, the company must keep borrowing capital, which requires strong financial health and a substantial cash flow. Amazon’s executives and investors see corporate restructuring and the resulting layoffs as necessary to keep the company’s financial health in check. So, is AI the reason for Amazon’s latest layoffs? The answer is yes, but not in the way many have assumed. It’s true that, in June 2025, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told employees that increased use of generative and agentic AI would lead to job cuts. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in a memo to staff. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today”. While AI can already automate some corporate tasks, it is not yet replacing human staff. However, the demand for AI solutions and cloud services to support AI development is directly responsible for the latest round of layoffs.

Amazon recently revealed 14,000 jobs set to go When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has revealed more details on the company's plans to lay off 14,000 workers, saying the cuts were influenced by a desire to stay relevant and agile in an ever-changing market. Speaking on Amazon’s latest quarterly earnings call to analysts, Jassy said the cuts looked to act on a belief the company had become too large and bulky following over-hiring in recent years. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven - not right now, at least,” he said. “Really, it’s culture.” Jassy went on to outline Amazon's approach to what he called, “the technology transformation happening right now,” noting that extra management layers in the company were delaying decision-making and holding back progress. “When that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions - the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line,” Jassy said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup." Amazon noted in its financial results it would take a $1.8 billion severance-related charge in the quarter related to the layoffs - however the company reported quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and $21 billion in profit. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Jassy's comments echo those made by Beth Galetti, Amazon's Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, who noted in the original note to employees that the cuts would make Amazon "even stronger", meaning it could shift resources, "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," Galetti added. Amazon has around 1.55 million employees across the entire company, but the cuts will affect its 350,000 corporate workers. Jassy had warned earlier in 2025 the rise in AI technology in major corporations such as Amazon would likely lead to job cuts, saying in a memo to staff that the company, "will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs."

It’s no secret that Amazon Games had been working on some version of a Lord of the Rings MMO, although the game had already been cancelled once due to contract disputes, and the second version, which was being worked on in conjunction with Embracer, hasn’t been seen or heard from in a while. The recent news of Amazon’s mass layoffs shift towards casual games, and specifically away from MMOs and AAA games, raised questions about the future of the Lord of the Rings MMO, however Amazon had—and still hasn’t—made an official proclamation regarding the game’s demise.

Title: Corporate America's new layoff strategy: smaller cuts, more often

Every time Tim publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The good news: You didn't get laid off. The bad? You might be cut next month. Some large employers are now embracing recurring job cuts rather than axing a bunch of workers all at once. That can help companies avoid cutting too deeply and minimize disruption. Yet drawn-out cuts can prolong workers' unease, pulverize morale, and make it harder for leaders to rally teams to move in a new direction. Companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have recently made cuts in stages. Amazon, which this week said it was laying off 14,000 employees, expects that in 2026 it will uncover "additional places we can remove layers," and "realize efficiency gains." Paramount, following its August merger with David Ellison's production company, Skydance, said this week it would cut about 1,000 employees. That's only about half of the expected reductions, a source familiar with the company's plans previously told Business Insider. Translation: More cuts are likely. Amazon declined to comment, and Paramount Skydance didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. "We're seeing a lot more of this drip-drip, which does cause uncertainty," Carly Holm, founder and CEO of the consulting firm Humani HR, told Business Insider. "It's not ideal." Layoffs have, in some cases, become a form of corporate preening — a way to demonstrate that those in charge are avoiding bloated org charts or feeble business lines, especially after turbo-charged hiring during the pandemic in industries like tech. Companies have also simply grown accustomed to routinely shedding workers, said Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "They may not have quite the same sense of, 'Gosh, this is bad, so let's just do it once and do it big,'" he told Business Insider. And with the job market cooling, Bidwell said, bosses don't have to worry as much that workers who remain will feel free to walk away. Many CEOs' thinking about layoffs has shifted over the decades, he said. Prior to around 1980, Bidwell said, employers tended to furlough workers, such as those in factories, when demand slipped, with the intention of hiring them back once things picked up. Layoffs, particularly among white-collar employees, were seen as a last resort, Bidwell said. "The big change today is, 'If we think it might raise profits, we're going to do it,'" he said. Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, said that researchers have found that layoffs can decrease creativity among workers who remain, and increase their stress and rates of burnout. That's why, he told Business Insider in an email, it would be "much better" to make one-time cuts rather than spreading them out. Another reason employers might prefer one big swing: People start leaving after layoffs. Research has shown that the share of workers who quit tends to increase by about 50% in the year following a layoff — and often the best performers are among them because they have options. While it can be disruptive to workers, it's easy to see why CEOs might not want to swing the axe all at once. If they overshoot, they risk having to hire again, and few things signal instability like a whiplash hiring spree. Getting the cuts over with might help morale and trust bounce back sooner, yet the approach also brings risks, said Sarah Rodehorst, cofounder and CEO of Onwards HR, which helps large companies stay compliant with regulations when laying off employees. In a moment when everything from AI to tariffs to government spending cuts is making decision-making difficult, there's a danger in cutting too quickly. What a business needs today could look very different six months from now, Rodehorst said. Plus, slashing too many people at once can make it harder to reassign work and rewire the organization's operations. "The business may need people for a period of time as part of that restructure," she said. "So, it's hard to let everyone go all at once." The risk, of course, is that the people left behind spend more time wondering if they're next rather than focusing on their jobs. Much as CEOs overseeing the cuts might wish it, the period after layoffs isn't exactly "innovation and growing-the-business time," said Scott Kirsner, CEO of InnoLead, a research firm focused on corporate innovation. Instead, he said, teams tend to be busy figuring out who's managing whom and what the company even looks like now. Bidwell, from Wharton, said that big cuts often create "huge turmoil" and that trying to avoid layoffs for several years can require leaders to make big predictions about what a business will need in the future. Even so, he said, the idea that businesses can simply cut and rehire as needed overlooks the hidden drags — things like damaged morale, lost institutional knowledge, and the time it takes new workers to get up to speed. "There are serious adjustment costs every time you bring new people in," Bidwell said. Besides, he said, while it's easy to tally up the salaries of laid-off workers, "it's a lot harder to assess the challenges that you're going to face in continuing to motivate your people and getting the work done."

Title: Amazon's Big Holiday Plan? Replacing 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, a New Report Says

Your guide to Amazon's automated future: What the 75% goal really means for workers. Learn more about Amazon's new goal to automate three-quarters of its warehouse tasks. Let's be real: Robots doing the grunt work at Amazon warehouses is nothing new; they've been sorting and moving packages for over a decade. But that was just the beginning. Amazon is now reportedly planning to make its human workforce a whole lot less necessary. According to The New York Times, the company is looking to replace replacing more than half a million jobs its human employees hold with a new, expanded robot army. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

Title: System changes are being made in how organisations hire, train, and incentivise employees: Microsoft’s Jay Parikh on AI’s impact on tech industry

As generative AI tools become one of the most significant changes in software creation since the rise of the personal computer, their impact can be felt in how both large and small tech organisations operate. The latest tech executive to echo this trend is Microsoft’s Jay Parikh, who has once again indicated that the artificial intelligence boom is not only changing the size and shape of the workforce at organisations but also how products are being developed. “There are some system changes here in terms of companies going through organisational change whether it be how they have organised things, how they incentivise, hire, and train employees, how they think about product development, or how they may think about should they be growing, staying flat, or shrink,” Parikh said in a closed-door briefing with select journalists at the GitHub Universe event in San Francisco this week. Parikh avoided using the term “layoffs”, but said companies are still “learning” and “figuring things out” as artificial intelligence, which Silicon Valley sees as the next major technological revolution, is dramatically changing organisations. Parikh, a former top engineering executive at Meta, was hired by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last year. Earlier this year, he was announced as Microsoft’s Executive Vice-President of CoreAI, a new engineering team responsible for AI initiatives across the company. He also oversees GitHub, which now operates as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI group. At major organisations worldwide, especially in the tech sector, several companies are reducing their workforces due to the adoption of AI. These job cuts are affecting white-collar workers in HR, marketing, sales, and engineering divisions — roles that were once considered high-paying. A recent Stanford study suggests that the impact of AI may hit harder on younger workers, especially in coding and customer support roles. This week, Amazon announced it had begun a reorganisation that will result in the elimination of 14,000 roles worldwide, citing AI as a key factor. Amazon joins other major companies in attributing recent job cuts to the use of AI. Walmart has also recently indicated that it intends to maintain its headcount at current levels over the next several years, primarily due to the impact of AI. Salesforce recently reduced its workforce by 4,000, citing “the benefits and efficiencies” brought by AI. One might question whether AI is bringing significant benefits, leading to layoffs becoming necessary. That remains unclear, but more large companies are now using, investing in, and measuring the business impact of generative AI, which suggests that the size and structure of their workforces are about to change, if they haven’t already. Ever since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT a few years ago, the AI chatbot has introduced consumers to a new way of interacting with technology by simply providing a prompt and receiving information about almost anything. It has since made its way into enterprises, with companies deploying customised AI agents to automate functions in customer support, marketing, coding, and across many domains. It’s not hard to see why Microsoft is turning to GitHub, which now boasts 180 million developers, to increase the adoption of AI agents across enterprises. In fact, Microsoft wants GitHub to become the central platform for AI coding agents. Its new Agent HQ interface allows external coding assistants, including OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code, to plug into the GitHub ecosystem. Microsoft and the entire tech industry are promoting AI agents as the most critical AI tools for businesses. These agents can automate complex routines, solve multistep problems, and handle large volumes of work in structured tasks such as computer programming, and document processing. As more organisations deploy armies of AI agents at scale, these agents work on their behalf, much like interns. However, the concern is that as demand for AI agents grows, these systems can now make sales calls and write software code — tasks once reserved for humans. The question is, if AI systems start writing code and building software, who will fill those roles when entry-level engineers are cut off and no longer get the opportunity? “I believe that the notion and definition of developers is going to change radically. I think we are going to see a lot more people able to build within any team, whether it’s a team of four or a team of 40,000; it doesn’t matter. I think the focus will be on how we use these superpowers – the capabilities of these agents and tools, and how quickly we can create things to reduce toil. This will allow us to spend more time on the creative and ideation side, and to be able to burn down backlogs much quicker,” Parikh said, responding to how the role of developers will evolve.

Title: Amazon ends active development on New World while promising servers stay live till 2026

Amazon Games has confirmed it will stop active development on its MMO New World, following the recent company-wide layoffs. The studio said Season 10: Nighthaven will serve as the final content drop, and that servers will remain online through 2026 while the team focuses on stabilization and basic support, stating in the official statement that “It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision.” The move follows a major restructuring across Amazon that has hit its games division hard. Reporting and company notices show substantial cuts affecting multiple Amazon Games teams, and the broader corporate shift appears to prioritize smaller, cloud-focused, and AI-driven projects over costly first-party MMO roadmaps. For players, the news stops short of an immediate closure: PvE, PvP, and in-game services will continue to operate, and the storefront will remain available, with Amazon providing a minimum notice period should a shutdown be considered beyond 2026. For the community, the announcement confirms what many dataminers and active players feared after earlier layoffs. New World enjoyed a resurgence earlier this year after substantial reworks and a cross-platform push, but sustaining the schedule and scope of MMO content is expensive. With active player numbers well below the title’s earlier peaks, Amazon judged further investment in fresh seasons and expansions to be unsustainable. Amazon’s approach is to treat the upcoming seasonal update as the last significant chapter, while shifting remaining staff to maintenance, bug fixes, and player support. The studio explicitly noted it will keep servers running for an extended wind-down period, allowing guilds and long-term players time to finish objectives and archive progress. The company also made recent content, such as Rise of the Angry Earth, free to players as part of the transition. Streamers and community organizers have already begun planning legacy runs and archival events, and questions about refunds, in-game economies, and long-term item availability are trending topics in community threads. The New World outcome highlights how corporate layoffs ripple into player communities and long-term product plans, and it underscores the high cost of sustaining large-scale online worlds. Players should expect official patch and compensation details to appear on New World’s channels in the coming weeks. For now, Season 10 is the swan song for active development, and players have through 2026 to finish their goals or prepare for whatever comes next in Amazon’s games strategy.

Title: Corporate America says AI isn't about cost-cutting, but jobs will go anyway, a Goldman Sachs banker survey finds

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Corporate America has touted artificial intelligence as the start of a new era of productivity, but Goldman Sachs' latest report suggests job cuts are already on the horizon. Goldman's analysis is based on a survey of 105 Goldman bankers, who service clients across various industries. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at how major US companies are actually utilizing AI and what that means for their workforces. The survey found that companies are primarily turning to AI to boost productivity and revenue — not to slash costs — with nearly half of banking clients using the technology to drive growth. This compares with just one in five deploying it primarily to cut expenses. Meanwhile, only about one in 10 firms has reduced head count so far due to AI, though nearly a third of bankers covering technology, media, and telecom clients report early signs of job pressure. Still, the bankers expect AI to start trimming payrolls soon. They forecast a 4% reduction in head count over the next year, followed by a deeper 11% cut within three years. "The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and head count reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected," wrote Goldman's analysts, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, in a Thursday note. About 55% of Goldman's bankers expect clients to rely on hiring freezes or natural attrition as AI reshapes roles, while 26% anticipate layoffs or broader restructuring. Goldman's bankers also see the most significant potential for AI-driven reductions in head count in customer support, where 80% of respondents expect cuts as automation takes hold. Other positions at risk include those in administrative support, operations at 49%, and IT and engineering. Goldman's report lands amid a wave of recent layoffs that underscore how quickly workforce reductions are spreading beyond traditional cost-cutting drives. Earlier this week, tech giant Amazon cut 14,000 jobs with CEO Andy Jassy saying the cuts were driven by cultural fit — not cost savings or AI. Still, the timing highlights how technology is reshaping hiring across sectors. "The relatively high current and expected adoption rates for US corporates and meaningful expected head count reductions support our long-standing view that AI is set to have a transformative impact on the labor market and economy," they wrote. Goldman's forecast for job losses reflects the rapid adoption of AI by companies. Goldman's bankers report that 37% of clients are already using AI for regular production — significantly above the Census Bureau's recent survey, which showed a 9.9% adoption rate. They expect the share of overall adoption to rise to 50% next year and 74% within three years, suggesting a rapid acceleration as AI tools become more embedded in day-to-day operations. Yet many companies remain cautious. About 61% of Goldman's bankers said clients view AI as "too early a technology" to deploy widely, and 47% said firms lack the in-house expertise to build the right tools. Jump to

Title: Not AI Or Costs, Amazon CEO Cited This Reason Behind Mass Layoffs
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/not-ai-or-costs-amazon-ceo-cited-this-reason-behind-mass-layoffs
Time Published: 2025-10-31T05:33:27Z

Amazon’s decision to slash 14,000 jobs this week was not about cutting costs or chasing artificial intelligence (AI) trends. Instead, it was a move to realign the company’s culture, according to CEO Andy Jassy. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Oct. 30, Jassy commented on the layoffs for the first time. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said, according to a Business Insider report. “It really— it's culture.” Jassy’s remarks reportedly reflect his ongoing effort to reshape Amazon’s internal culture this year, a push focused on raising performance standards, enforcing discipline and cutting through bureaucracy. The job cuts announced on Oct. 28 represent Amazon’s largest round of layoffs since the company shed 27,000 roles in late 2022. During Thursday’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon’s rapid expansion in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers” within the organisation, which in turn slowed down decision-making. He said that with the ongoing AI transformation reshaping industries, agility is more important than ever. “Sometimes, without realising it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy said, according to Business Insider, adding, “And it can lead to slowing you down.” Jassy’s comments highlight a trend spreading across Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft have also been flattening their organisational structures, reducing management layers to accelerate operations and eliminate corporate excess. In the latest round of job cuts on Oct. 28, Amazon reportedly informed some affected employees of their termination through text messages. Many workers received two early-morning texts that day, notifying them their roles had been eliminated. The first message advised staff to check their personal or work email accounts before leaving for the office, while a follow-up text instructed anyone who had not yet received an email about their employment status to contact the helpdesk for assistance. The purpose of these text alerts, sent shortly after the emails, was reportedly to prevent affected employees from facing the awkward situation of arriving at work only to find their building access had been revoked.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defends 14,000 job cuts, says ‘not about costs or AI’ — so what's behind it?

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after CEO Andy Jassy had warned that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could reduce the company’s workforce. In a surprising twist during Amazon's quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not about cost-cutting or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said the affected employees did not align with Amazon's culture. This marked the first time he addressed the layoffs since their announcement. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” Andy Jassy's remarks align with Amazon's broader mission to reshape its culture this year, as chronicled by Business Insider. He has been working to raise the e-commerce giant's performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy across the company. During the earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon's rapid growth in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers,” which has ultimately slowed down the decision-making process. He stressed the need for the company to “operate leaner and move faster,” especially amid the transformative impact of AI across different industries. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.” While Jassy focused on cultural and structural factors behind the layoffs, the initial announcement — made by Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, through a blog post on Tuesday — cited a different reason. Galetti explained that the rapid evolution of the world due to AI was the reason behind reducing employee headcount, despite the company's strong performance. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” Galetti wrote in the blog post. The most recent layoffs at Amazon marked the company's biggest job cut since it let go of 27,000 employees in late 2022, Business Insider reported. The move also points to a wider trend in Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft are embracing what's being called the “Great Flattening” - trimming layers of managers to move faster and reduce corporate bloat. Amazon also disclosed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs, the news report said.

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: AI didn’t break agencies – the talent drain did

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A senior marketer at a major WPP Media client told me recently they’re thinking about shopping around for a new agency. That, in itself, isn’t surprising, especially after WPP’s new CEO Cindy Rose, publicly admitted the company had “lost its way”. What stood out was why they’re considering the move. It’s not about chasing AI breakthroughs or assembling yet another full-stack planning and buying setup. It’s something more fundamental — and harder to fix: the people. “They’re ultimately what matter to me as a client,” they continued. “If we put the account up for a review, that’s going to be part of our decision. We’re not big enough to get the best payment terms so we have to focus on where we get the best service.” Because while AI and data dominate the holding company narrative, the harder truth is it’s still about the people, specifically the ones talking to clients, translating their needs and hopes into something a machine can use. Without them, there’s no story worth telling and no work worth executing. That’s true for small clients as much as it is for the biggest ones. And it’s the quiet advantage of the best holdcos. Not the grand vision but the execution. It’s why WPP fought so hard to keep Laurent Ezekiel from leaving for Publicis – and taking Coca-Cola’s North American media business with him. It’s also why Jacki Kelley, IPG’s chief client and business officer, has become such a stabilizing force as she guides clients through the uncertainty surrounding Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of the group. “The client owners at the holdcos are very powerful at the moment,” said Ruben Schreurs, CEO of media management firm Ebiquity. “They run these big pitches, and they are the ones who coordinate and bring together all these different capabilities across the agency group to benefit the client.” The real power inside holdcos now belongs to the people who run the clients, not the ones running the agencies. Think of them as chief client or business officers. Their work isn’t flashy but its crucial. Take something as basic as managing a client roster. Stack too many high-maintenance accounts that demand constant re-planning, and even the strongest teams start to crack. Balance one or two of those with steadier clients, and things stay sustainable. It’s agency management 101 but it’s harder to pull off when the pressure to chase growth collides with the reality of leaner headcounts. Ultimately, that’s what CMOs buy. Not tools or tech stacks but people who can make the complicated feel simple and the promises real. I was reminded of that in a recent conversation with a consultant who advises two WPP clients. I asked whether either of them was concerned by the holdco’s struggles, and they laughed before saying no. For them, what matters most isn’t the corporate shakeups. It’s the service they get from their account director – the person who knows their business, answers the phone and makes things happen. That person, the consultant said, is far more valuable to them than any data platform or AI capability. Not least because the technology can flatter to deceive. Agencies have laid off hundreds of people in the name of AI, yet the promise of truly autonomous agents still hasn’t materialized. Most of what’s being sold as automation still needs human oversight. And even then, it hasn’t shown it can come close to the kind of ingenuity that made advertising a cultural force in the first place. None of this dismisses the importance of technology. It just means the human layer – the senior talent that keeps clients connected to a complicated, centralized structure – has never mattered more. These are the people who know how to make a holding company work for a client, not against them. When that experience walks out the door, things start to fray: briefs go missing, timelines slip and what was meant to feel seamless turns into red tape. The irony, of course, is that these executives are now in short supply just as their value is becoming obvious. Some have left on their own terms, others were pushed out. Many were the ones who didn’t fit in a model that prized consolidation over chemistry and scale over service. Now, as holdcos try to rewire themselves for the AI era, they’re learning the same old lesson: the people were the strategy all along. The machines are improving but the judgment around them is eroding. That’s what stood out in the World Federation of Advertisers’ latest report: more marketers are reaching a level of maturity where they value agency execs who can move across a holdco’s resources, unshackled by P&L silos or internal questions. When they ask a question, they don’t want spin or salesmanship, they want a clear, honest answer. “These people are unicorns,” said one executive. “They can read the numbers, understand the brief and challenge the model. But they’re the first ones deemed too expensive.” Which is to say: for all the talk about AI transforming agencies, it’s also hollowing them out, leaving fewer people capable of critical judgement inside increasingly automated structures. Agencies save money on executional labor but rarely reinvest it in the translators — the people who can make the technology useful. Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer of MediaSense, summed it up in a message he sent me: “AI is of course transforming the future of work for Agencies but agentic without agency (small a!) is a potential recipe for disaster. There are essentially two transformations underway within agencies. First delivering the promise of AI through more effective, more strategic and thoughtful work (at scale). Second, doing this ‘through the line’ and breaking down the silos that are holding clients back from truly customer centric marketing. This was an important theme in our Future of Media Organisation study which revealed how intentionally brands and their media organizations are pivoting from being individual contributors to connectors of the customer journey. For agencies this demands a reset in their talent profile and the curriculum needed to be valuable to today’s marketer.” The ad industry’s plan to define what counts as AI With AI on the rise, industry bodies such as the IAB, MRC and WFA are all taking their own approaches in an attempt to bring some order to the chaos. At the same time, some marketers are already starting to steer their clients away from AI-made “slop” In graphic detail: how AI search is changing brand visibility Digiday has charted the state of AI search for marketers and how brands are (and aren’t) responding. Ad tech’s economy depends on float and it’s getting pricier to keep it moving Typically in ad tech, money moves slower than the ads it sells. But it turns out as time goes on, those late payments are being delayed more and more, and agencies of all sizes aren’t immune to the impacts it has. Meta shares fall on higher expense guidance despite record revenue Meta recorded $51.2 billion in revenue during its Q3 2025 earnings call, equating to a 26% year-over-year growth, but after warning analysts and investors that the amount the company spends on AI is likely to rise “significantly”, Meta’s stock dropped more than 7%, according to WSJ. OpenAI has an AGI problem – and Microsoft just made it worse OpenAI has a new for-profit structure, but its latest deal with Microsoft seems to come with some strings attached, according to The Verge. Nvidia becomes world’s first $5tn company Nvidia has become the world’s first $5 trillion company, according to Financial Times. The company’s stock increased as a result of strong sales of its AI systems, as well as the prospect of access to China, an idea that is expected to be floated by President Donald Trump during his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. More than 1,500 chief executives have left their posts so far this year through August, up 4% from last year. It’s no secret the company wants advertisers to see its demand-side platform as the backbone for buying across the open web. The holdco hopes its new product can open up SaaS revenue.

Title: Sega Forever creator confirms departure from Sega after seven years

Former Senior Global Community Manager for Sega of America, Danny Russell, who spearheaded the Sega Forever initiative, confirmed that he’s left the company after more than seven years via a LinkedIn post. In the post, he announced, “After some time away from socials for personal reasons, I’m ready to share that last year I moved on from Sega, closing an incredible chapter of my career.” Russell mentioned his proudest achievements in the post, including launching and running Sega Forever from scratch. The initiative was launched in 2017 by Sega as a move to re-release retro classics on iOS and Android. The Sega Forever project evolved beyond a retro-emulation service and gradually shifted into a game preservation effort, featuring retrospectives and unearthing and preserving rare assets in a digital archive. Sega Forever’s social media handle on X became the voice for retro enthusiasts worldwide, posting almost daily until it finally went silent by the end of August 2023, with the final post celebrating the recovery and restoration of the SEGAWORLD London Sonic statue at Gamescom. Many speculate that the abrupt silence was due to layoffs at Sega. In September 2023, Russell deleted a post that suggested some internal struggles. In the post, Russell stated: What should you do when you’ve been bullied all year and no one is helping, five months after raising a grievance. I have been off ill in recent weeks, adapting to medication due to the stress of this past year, and this bully has used this time to take even more away from me. Sega briefly teased a revival of the Sega Forever project back in January 2025 with a rebranded X account, but it has not led to anything new since. By June 2025, Sega delisted many of its classic titles from Android and iOS storefronts. However, players who downloaded the now-removed titles can still play them offline. Russell concluded the post, stating: I am deeply grateful to fans, collaborators, content creators, and partners I worked with along the way. Your creativity and passion made every project special. I am especially excited to have seen Shinobi return and remain hopeful that other legacy IPs that I supported behind the scenes (Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Virtua Fighter) get the spotlight they deserve. I wish my friends at Sega all the best for the future. Buy Sega Genesis Classics on Amazon Danny Russell – LinkedIn, Mirror post on X

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Earnings week for the Mag 7 brought mixed results and sharp stock moves. Apple rose more than 3 percent after reporting $102.47 billion revenue and $1.85 EPS, driven by iPhone and Services. Alphabet logged its first $100 billion quarter, up 16 percent year over year, on strong search and cloud performance. Microsoft posted $77.7 billion revenue and $3.72 EPS but fell on concerns about AI infrastructure spending. Meta set a record $51.24 billion revenue, then dropped 10 percent after a $15.9 billion tax charge and rising Reality Labs capex. Oracle stayed elevated as cloud sales climbed 28 percent in September. Amazon jumped over 13% after the market closed thanks to the AWS cloud unit posting its largest revenue growth rate since 2022. Nvidia reached a $5 trillion valuation on relentless AI chip demand, announced seven U.S. supercomputers, invested $1 billion in Nokia, and confirmed plans for up to $100 billion in OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang forecast $500 billion in AI chip sales as investors treated Nvidia as the core of global AI infrastructure. Shares rose 5.6% to $212.19 after reports that President Trump will discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chips with China’s Xi Jinping. CEO Jensen Huang projected $500 billion in AI chip sales and announced seven new U.S. supercomputers. Nvidia also invested $1 billion in Nokia to develop AI-native 5G and 6G networks. Its stock is up 50% this year. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, cementing its dominance as AI infrastructure demand outpaces supply. Sesame, the smart-glasses startup led by former Oculus co-founders Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell, raised $250 million in Series B funding. Sequoia Capital and Spark Capital led the round bringing total funding to about $300 million. The company is developing lightweight AI-powered glasses equipped with voice assistants named Miles and Maya to create an “ambient interface” that understands context and environment. Sesame’s blend of spatial computing and conversational AI positions it as a competitor to Apple, Meta, and Google-backed Magic Leap in the race to define the next generation of AI wearables. For Iribe, who previously founded Scaleform (acquired by Autodesk) and co-founded Oculus (acquired by Facebook for $2 billion), Sesame marks his fourth major venture. White-collar layoffs are accelerating as AI adoption reshapes office work. Last week we reported Amazon is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. This is the tip of the AI iceberg looming before the labor market. UPS has trimmed 14,000 managers over two years, and Target plans 1,800 more cuts. JPMorgan, Walmart, Accenture and others have revealed plans to slow hiring. All cited AI. PwC, the accounting and consulting giant, cut staff globally, partly because of AI. Nestlé cut jobs, blaming automation.GM to Booz Allen are reducing staff, citing efficiency and automation. Nearly two million Americans have been unemployed for six months or longer, while demand for trade, healthcare, and construction workers rises. Recruiters report middle-aged professionals struggling to keep up with new technologies and entry-level hiring tightening. Economists warn that AI-driven restructuring is eroding white-collar stability even as overall productivity improves.The irony is that the companies downsizing will yield huge dividends from Wall Street, which as far as I can tell, has never met a reorg it does not like (remember Meta’s “year of efficiency”?) OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced plans to create an autonomous “AI researcher” by 2028, with an intern-level assistant expected by 2026. The company is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing large-scale investment while its nonprofit foundation retains 26% ownership. Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki said models could surpass human intelligence within a decade through greater “test time compute” and algorithmic advances. OpenAI plans to dedicate entire data centers to major research problems, investing $1.4 trillion to build 30 gigawatts of infrastructure. The foundation will allocate $25 billion for disease research and oversee safety and governance. Magic Leap and Google have partnered to build reference hardware for the Android XR ecosystem. At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, they revealed a prototype that merges Magic Leap’s waveguide optics with Google’s Raxium microLED engine, a key technology for lightweight AR glasses. The three-year deal positions Magic Leap as an optics and display supplier rather than a consumer brand, with Google focusing on the software layer. The prototype underscores Google’s return to spatial computing and its strategy to seed Android-based AR hardware through partners instead of producing its own glasses. VRChat has launched on Android and iOS, opening the social VR platform to millions of mobile users. The iOS app supports devices running iOS 17 or newer, while Android requires version 10 and at least 6 GB RAM. Phones with less memory can use a limited “Companion” mode. The mobile rollout ends the platform’s beta phase and extends its reach beyond PC and VR headsets, potentially driving major user growth. VRChat recently hit 54,000 concurrent users on PC, its highest count in years, and expects a significant surge as mobile players join its creator-driven virtual worlds. Meta Horizon is approaching mobile XR the same way. Rec Room tried this, but all it did was add users and UGC spam, not revenue, and was partially responsible for layoffs there. This column has a companion, The AI/XR Podcast, hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, and Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and futurist for Paramount and Fox, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

Title: Amazon CEO Now Says AI Is Not Responsible for Recent Layoffs

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes Amazon just posted its third-quarter earnings and it turns out it was a phenomenal quarter for the e-commerce giant, despite recent layoffs. The company giant raked in $180.2 billion in sales in the three months ending Sept. 30, up 13% from the same period last year. Its cloud business, AWS, reported its largest year-over-year growth since 2022, climbing 20% to $33 billion. The company’s stock even popped 13% in after-hours trading following the report. So why, with the company performing so well, did Amazon just slash 14,000 corporate jobs and hinted that more cuts could be on the way? Fortunately for us, CEO Andy Jassy was asked to comment on the layoffs during the company’s earnings call Thursday evening. However, he was quick to downplay any connection to AI. âWhat I would tell you is, you know, the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now at least,â Jassy told investors. âIt’s culture.â He went on to try to make the case that the companyâs rapid growth over the last several years added more people, layers, and complexity to its operations. This quick growth, in turn, slowed decision-making and weakened ownership for workers at the frontlines. Jassy said Amazon is now committed to operating like the world’s largest startup in order to move more quickly during what he called the major “technology transformation happening right now.â The memo sent to laid-off employees earlier this week hit a lot of the same points Jassy made. But it also directly named the big tech shift, AI, that he had been hinting at, even as he claimed it wasnât driving this round of layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,â wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, in the memo. Still, these job cuts also come as Amazon, and the rest of Silicon Valley, is seemingly betting it all on AI. Jassy said on Thursday that the companyâs AI and cloud infrastructure added more than 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months and is expected to add another gigawatt this fourth quarter. And future cuts may not be limited to corporate workers. The New York Times reported last week that Amazonâs automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. Overall, Amazonâs robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the companyâs operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.

Title: Amazon's CEO says its 14,000 job cuts weren't driven by costs or AI: 'It's about culture'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs this week — not to cut costs or chase AI, but because they didn't fit the culture. That's according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who shared his thoughts about the layoffs for the first time during the company's quarterly earnings call on Thursday. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said, referring to the job cuts announced on Tuesday. "It really — it's culture." Jassy's remark aligns with his broader mission to reshape Amazon's culture this year, which Business Insider chronicled. He is trying to raise performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts on Tuesday in a blog post, explaining that despite the company's strong performance, it is reducing jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote. Tuesday's layoffs marked Amazon's biggest job cut since it shed 27,000 positions in late 2022. On Thursday's call, Jassy said Amazon's rapid growth in recent years created "a lot more layers" that have slowed decision-making. He emphasized that, with the ongoing AI transformation, there has never been a more critical time for the company to operate leaner and move faster. "Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work," Jassy added. "And it can lead to slowing you down." Amazon isn't the only Big Tech giant embracing the "Great Flattening." Google and Microsoft have been trimming layers of managers too, aiming to move faster and shed corporate bloat. Amazon also revealed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs. Have a tip?

Title: Amazon CEO Says 14,000-Person Layoffs Weren’t Due to AI or Finances: ‘It’s About Culture’

“It’s important to be lean,” Andy Jassy says as he touts the tech behemoth as “the world’s largest startup” Amazon’s 14,000-person layoffs earlier this week weren’t necessarily driven by financial or AI factors, CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. Instead, the primary motivation behind cutting the workforce was “culture,” he explained. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now. It’s culture,” he told analysts on the call, explaining that as Amazon grew dramatically over the last few years, the company added more “layers” that became cumbersome to its decision-making process. “When that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down,” he said. Jassy continued: “As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and that means removing layers, it means increasing the amount of ownership that people have and it means inventing and moving quickly. I don’t know if there’s ever been a time in the history of Amazon, or maybe business in general, with the technology transformation happening right now where it’s important to be lean, important to be flat, it’s important to move fast, and that’s what we’re going to do.” When Amazon cut 14,000 people on Tuesday, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, cited the need to be nimble in the AI era in a note to staff. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” The layoffs may not be over yet, although Jassy did not indicate more to come on Thursday’s earnings call. The company has plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots in the coming years, believing it can leverage new technology to avoid filling hundreds of thousands of roles, according to the New York Times.
