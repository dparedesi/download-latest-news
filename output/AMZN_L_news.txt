Amazon on Tuesday appeared to have prematurely alerted Amazon Web Services cloud-computing employees to layoffs planned for Wednesday morning by sending a commiseration email and team-wide meeting invitation hours early. Reuters reported on Friday that Amazon intended to lay off thousands of ‍corporate employees ⁠starting this week. But the company has not yet informed impacted employees, nor has it confirmed the layoff plan. The email sent on Tuesday signed by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrongly said that impacted employees in the U.S., Canada ​and Costa Rica had already been informed they lost ‌their jobs. In Slack messages viewed by Reuters, AWS employees who received the email said the Wednesday meeting was almost immediately canceled. Amazon ​referred in the email to the layoffs as “Project Dawn.” “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, reviewed by Reuters. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jobs in the company’s units covering AWS, retail, Prime Video and human resources were slated to ‌be affected, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, though the full scope of this week’s cuts was unclear. Amazon laid off about 14,000 people ‌in October as part of a broader plan to reduce corporate staff by around 30,000, people familiar with the matter said at the ‌time. On Tuesday, Amazon cut jobs in its Fresh grocery and Go market divisions as it plans to close existing brick-and-mortar stores and convert some ‌of them to Whole ‍Foods stores. ⁠It did not ​disclose the number of affected employees. The size of the cuts to be announced on Wednesday remained unclear. The full 30,000 ⁠jobs flagged in October would represent a small portion of ⁠Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of the firm’s corporate workforce. Amazon, in an October blog post, tied those job cuts to the increased use of artificial intelligence. That post ‌from the head of human resources, Beth Galetti, indicated more job cuts were likely in the future. The errant email Tuesday referred to ‌a blog post by Galetti, which has not yet appeared on Amazon’s website. Sunil Grover, famous for his Aamir Khan impression on The Great Indian Kapil Show, finds solace in performing and taking on different identities. This is a common experience for many as it allows for a break from self-evaluation. However, it's crucial to distinguish between healthy exploration and unhealthy attachment to roles.

Title: Amazon accidentally sends email confirming layoffs

US technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error. The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to "strengthen the company." The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to "remove bureaucracy" at the firm. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make "broad reductions every few months", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 corporate job cuts in October. "While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now," she said. Amazon employs around 1.5 million people globally, with around 350,000 in corporate roles. Amazon has not said where the latest job losses will fall or which countries will be affected. On Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers. The title of the invitation was "Send project Dawn email," an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job redundancies. While the email made clear that the cuts were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the email said. "Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The lay-offs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former worker who asked not be identified. The broad understanding among staff had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, the former employee added, who left Amazon as part of a redundancy round in October. The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major set of lay-offs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May. While affected workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company. Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of cuts. Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm. In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time. Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the chief executive said he was thankful for the "challenges at opportunities at work" as "the world is changing at a very rapid rate." Jassy called this era at Amazon "a time to rethink everything we've ever done." Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.

Amazon Layoffs: Tech giant Amazon on Tuesday mistakenly sent a notice to some employees, confirming a wave of upcoming layoffs at the company. Employees in the company's cloud division received an internal email acknowledging “organizational changes” at Amazon, according to a report by CNBC. The notice appeared to have been sent prematurely to Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees, a day before the next round of Amazon layoffs, part of the e-commerce giant's plan to cut 30,000 jobs, was scheduled to begin on Wednesday morning, as per Reuters. “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of applied AI solutions at AWS, wrote in the email, seen by CNBC. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success," it added. The email also mentions a post from Amazon’s HR boss Beth Galetti, saying that the company had already notified “impacted colleagues in our organization,” in the US, Canada and Costa Rica that they had lost their jobs. According to Reuters, AWS employees who received the email said in their Slack messages that the meeting called for Wednesday was almost immediately cancelled. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” the email further read, as per Reuters. Reuters earlier reported that Amazon intended to lay off thousands of corporate employees starting this week. However, the Andy Jassy-led company has not yet informed impacted workers, nor has it confirmed the news. Jobs in the company's units covering AWS, retail, Prime Video and human resources were slated to be affected, Reuters reported, quoting people familiar with the matter. The full scope of Amazon's layoffs this week remained unclear.

Title: Some Amazon employees get 'Project Dawn' calendar invitation discussing upcoming job cuts

Time Published: 2026-01-28T01:10:26Z

Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days. The invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned "Project Dawn," an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider. The invitation had the subject line "Send Project Dawn email" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant. The invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider. "This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers," the accompanying message read. "The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed." "Changes like this are hard on everyone," Aubrey's message continued. "These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success." Amazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. After the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated. "Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?" one employee wrote. Others saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent. "Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it," one person wrote. "Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today." It remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut. "People are speculating you're safe if invited," one employee said. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at ekim@businessinsider.com or Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at 650-942-3061.

Pinterest plans to lay off under 15% of its workforce, as part of broader restructuring that arrives as the image-sharing platform pivots more of its money to artificial intelligence. In a Tuesday securities filing, San Francisco-based Pinterest said it was making these cuts to support “transformation initiatives” — which include reallocating the company’s resources to AI-focused roles and prioritizing AI-powered products. It said it was also working to reshape its “sales and go-to-market approach.” Beyond the coming layoffs, Pinterest said it will reduce office space. The company expects to complete its restructuring plan by the end of September, incurring pretax charges of $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest’s job cuts are expected to impact hundreds of workers. As of the end of last year, Pinterest had a total headcount of about 5,200 employees, the company confirmed to The Associated Press. Amazon said it’s closing all of its Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh locations, as the online behemoth focuses on its grocery delivery, Whole Foods Market and a new “supersized” store concept. The Seattle-based online retailer said Tuesday in a blog post that it plans to convert some of those soon-to-be shuttered locations into Whole Foods Market stores. The company operates 57 Amazon Fresh stores and 15 Amazon Go stores. The last day of operation for Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go stores is Feb. 1.

Title: 12 Signposts That Indicate That A Monumental Economic Meltdown Is Now Upon Us

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? We live at a time when the pace of change is so rapid that it can be overwhelming at times. More change occurs in a single month than happened during most entire years when I was growing up. When I pull up the news each day, there is always a fresh serving of chaos awaiting me. Unfortunately, chaos is not good for the economy. The U.S. dollar is in the process of dying, debt levels are exploding all around us, more mass layoffs have been announced within the past 24 hours, and the cost of living crisis is absolutely crushing most Americans. Those that can look at the information that I am about to share with you and say “everything is fine” are simply not being rational. The following are 12 signposts that indicate that a monumental economic meltdown is now upon us… #1 Consumer confidence just fell to the lowest level that we have seen in 12 years… America’s economic mood deteriorated in January to its lowest level in more than a decade as consumers fretted about geopolitical tensions, affordability and President Donald Trump’s unrelenting trade war. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index for January, released Tuesday, declined 9.7 points to a reading of 84.5, the lowest since 2014, surpassing the lows of last year when Trump unveiled stiff tariffs and the depths of the pandemic recession in 2020. January’s reading came in much lower than the 91.1 reading economists projected in a poll by data firm FactSet. #2 One recent survey discovered that 56 percent of U.S. workers are experiencing serious financial strain… Social media is rife with tearful videos of how hard it has become to make ends meet. Some 14% of workers can’t or struggle to pay their bills each month, PwC found. Another 42% pay their bills with little or nothing left over for savings. PwC says that’s more than half of the workforce experiencing financial strain in 2025. “I have to work 40 hours a week just so I can have a place to live,” one woman said in one Instagram post. “Forty hours a week makes me $2000 a month and my rent is $1,660. So I work 40 hours a week so I can have a two-bedroom apartment and an extra $300 a month. Like, that doesn’t even cover my phone, internet, food.” #3 According to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity, the percentage of the U.S. workforce that is “functionally unemployed” has risen to a whopping 25.2 percent… Employment researchers are warning that the share of Americans who are only loosely attached to the labor force is on the rise, and that the true rate of unemployment may be far higher than official figures suggest. According to a new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), 25.2 percent of the U.S. workforce could now be classified as “functionally unemployed”—meaning jobless, seeking but unable to secure full-time employment or earning “poverty-level wages.” #4 It is being reported that 1,500 HR employees that work for Amazon are facing the axe… Amazon is expected to cut more jobs within its human resources team by a significant margin. According to Fortune, the e-commerce giant is preparing to lay off approximately 15% of its HR department — equivalent to around 1,500 of the 10,000 HR employees. It is currently unknown when the layoffs will take place, and how many jobs in the Puget Sound region are at risk. #5 At one time, Pinterest was flying high. But now harder times are here and it intends to fire close to 15 percent of its entire workforce… Pinterest said Tuesday it plans to lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as the company embraces artificial intelligence. In a securities filing, Pinterest said it expects the cuts will be complete by the end of its third quarter in late September. Shares of Pinterest slid more than 9%. #6 Nike just announced that it will be eliminating 775 jobs… Nike is planning to cut nearly 800 jobs amid an automation push at the footwear and apparel giant’s distribution centers. The company is cutting 775 jobs that will primarily impact jobs at the retailer’s distribution centers in Tennessee and Mississippi as the company looks to automate more of its supply chain. The news was first reported by CNBC, citing people familiar with the matter. #7 Not to be outdone by any of the companies mentioned above, UPS plans to throw up to 30,000 employees into the streets this year… United Parcel Service plans to cut up to 30,000 workers this year as it moves to cut costs, the delivery giant’s chief financial officer said Tuesday. “In terms of semi-variable costs, we expect to reduce operational positions by up to 30,000,” UPS CFO Brian Dykes said during a company earnings call. “This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers.” #8 The Washington Post is preparing for “big layoffs”, and that could include the entire sports department… The Washington Post has been around for nearly 150 years and had a sports section for almost as long. But after years and years of declining revenue, it appears that big layoffs are coming – and the sports section could be gutted hardest of all. According to Dylan Byers of Puck, “massive layoffs” are set to hit The Washington Post in the days to come with the foreign desk being hit hard. However, Byers noted that the sports desk is rumored to be getting “shuttered entirely.” #9 The largest mall in San Francisco has been permanently closed even sooner than expected… San Francisco’s beleaguered Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping mall closed its doors earlier than expected. The city’s largest mall, which saw a string of retailers leave in recent months, closed on Saturday, two days ahead of schedule, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. A sign reading “closed until further notice” was posted at the front entrance of the once-bustling shopping center, the outlet reported. #10 Pending home sales in the United States just fell “to the lowest level for any December on record”… Pending home sales, which track the number of contracts signed in December, plunged by 9.3% seasonally adjusted from November, to the lowest level for any December on record in the data by the National Association of Realtors, which goes back to 2010. Compared to December 2010, during the Housing Bust, pending sales were down by 21.5%. The market is now well into its fourth year of the collapse in transactions, and there has simply been no improvement. #11 The U.S. dollar just declined for a fourth consecutive day, and it is now at the lowest level that we have seen in four months… The U.S. ⁠dollar fell for a fourth straight day on Tuesday, slipping to a four-month low, as traders kept watch for possible coordinated currency intervention by U.S. and Japanese authorities and a ‍Federal Reserve interest rate decision. #12 If someone tries to convince you that the U.S. dollar is not dying, just show them this chart… When the value of the U.S. dollar declines, the purchasing power of our money goes down. Meanwhile, the price of silver is currently sitting at 110 dollars an ounce. Many of us have been warning that all of this was coming, and now it is happening right in front of our eyes. Our leaders have been making very bad decisions for decades, and now we are paying the price. But if you think that things are bad now, just hold on tight, because things are going to get even more chaotic in the months ahead.

Title: Modern Gamers Won’t Experience One of Gaming’s Worst Trends, But They Face Something Worse

Time Published: 2026-01-27T20:30:00Z

By Tom Wilson As gaming has evolved, many of the frustrating woes that plagued players have largely disappeared. From frustrating tank controls to restrictive gameplay mechanics, there are a lot of minor and major issues that those gaming today may never even experience. With so many of them in our proverbial rearview mirrors, one would be forgiven for thinking that there’s little wrong with the state of video games today. Of course, that’s a ridiculous notion, owing to the many, many, many problems with the industry, layoffs, monetization methods, and more. Fortunately, despite all of that, we’ve managed to quash one of gaming’s worst trends, the scarcity of media. The era of being unable to find your favorite game in your local store, or, indeed, having missed out on it the first time around and needing to fork over hundreds of dollars as the price of old media continues to rise, is over. Yet, despite that, there’s still one problem gamers face today that is arguably worse. Players may no longer need to worry about getting their hands on a physical or digital copy of a game, but they do need to worry about said games going completely extinct and becoming unplayable. When I was a child, I remember walking into my local secondhand game store looking for Final Fantasy X. Alas, all I could see was Final Fantasy X-2. I assumed it must have been a deluxe edition of the game (the 2 in the name should perhaps have been a clue it was a sequel), so I picked it up and muddled my way through a somewhat confusing experience. The likes of Steam or even mainstream online buying weren’t quite as popular as they are now, and the preservation of media through digital content or mass production wasn’t in full swing. If you wanted to buy a game, you had to go out and find it, and if it wasn’t there, you just couldn’t get it. Nowadays, gaming is such a widespread hobby that video games are produced on a far greater scale physically and are available on more digital platforms than ever before. Much has been said about Xbox’s move to ditch console exclusivity, but even that notion shows just how far we’ve come in making the hobby more accessible to a wider pool of people. You don’t need to settle for whatever your local store has on offer (although I still recommend supporting them whenever possible), as Steam holds over 100,000 games, and thousands of others are available on other digital storefronts. If you want to buy a game nowadays, you just go online and find it, whether it’s on Amazon or otherwise. This is all fairly common knowledge at this point, but something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. The preservation of art and media is so incredibly important, and that’s easier than ever thanks to this shift in production and distribution. The death of scarcity, while perhaps leading to choice paralysis, does mean that games like Final Fantasy X are a mere click away now. However, a new problem has taken its place, one that is actually far worse, despite the significant strides taken to stop things like it from happening in the first place. The live service genre has its fair share of issues that have been well documented online. However, by far the biggest issue with live service games is their longevity, or rather, their lack of it. Live service games are designed to be inherently disposable, the lifespan of the servers hosting them tied to the amount of money coming in and consequently the player base supporting them. Essentially, once that player count drops or the publisher decides it isn’t worth supporting the game anymore, the live service game is removed from existence. It isn’t just taken offline and left for players to enjoy as a single-player experience. This is the case occasionally, such as with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League (which is quickly reaching its impending doom), but more often, live service games are just rendered unplayable once their servers are taken offline. Entire games that had millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars poured into them, teams of dedicated artists crafting them, and loyal fans who enjoy playing them are removed from existence. No other artform, beyond publicity stunts or socio-political statements, has had entire works deleted simply because they’re no longer supported. Of course, there have been films lost to time due to the corrosion of the literal material they’re shot upon, or because they didn’t get enough widespread distribution at the time (much like video games 20 years ago). However, beyond that, if a film comes out in cinemas, or a work of art is displayed in a museum, or a book is published, you can find it, physically or otherwise, one way or another. Even some of the greatest forgotten video games are still accessible thanks to physical copies doing the rounds on secondhand sites like eBay. Live service games are an anomaly in the world of art, and a huge problem for modern gamers who invest time and money into them. In 2025, after six years on the market, EA killed Anthem, the divisive game from the critically acclaimed and beloved studio, BioWare. Honestly, it was devastating, not just because an entire experience was rendered extinct at the press of a button, but because, among all the flaws, there was still a lot of fun to be had with Anthem. It also means that those new to gaming, or those just discovering BioWare’s works, will never get to experience it, warts and all. That’s a huge blow to game preservation, as are the deaths of many other games like it. The loss of live service titles has sparked numerous petitions, including one that came about as a result of Ubisoft shutting down The Crew without implementing some form of offline mode. However, while, in some cases, developers have chosen to add a single-player experience to ensure their games are still playable long after the servers have blinked out of existence, many continue to just pull their games without a thought to preserving their legacy. One can hope that, like video game scarcity, it will be a problem that is eventually solved. The integration of offline modes or a move away from this type of experience altogether would be hugely beneficial, but perhaps unreasonable. Whereas video game scarcity was solved merely by the increase in popularity of the medium and technological innovation, the death of live service games must be fixed at a publisher and developer level. Servers cannot be left online indefinitely, so offline modes must be prioritized, and they don’t come free. I sincerely hope that future gamers won’t have this issue and will write articles about how we all suffered through it. What do you think?

Title: UPS will cut 30K more jobs after massive 2025 layoffs as it ends Amazon partnership

United Parcel Service announced Tuesday about 30,000 job cuts this year as the company winds down its partnership with Amazon as part of an intense cost-cutting agenda — and after cutting tens of thousands of jobs just last year. The Atlanta-based delivery giant plans to slash total operational hours by approximately 25 million by reducing its dependence on Amazon, CFO Brian Dykes said during a call with analysts Tuesday. “In terms of variable costs, we expect to reduce operational positions by up to 30,000,” Dykes said. “This will be accomplished through attrition, and we expect to offer a second voluntary separation program for full-time drivers.” UPS also said it has identified 24 buildings for closure in the first half of 2026, adding that further closures could come later this year. The company closed 93 buildings last year. The company also plans to “further deploy automation” across its network, Dykes said. UPS slashed a whopping 48,000 jobs last year, including 34,000 operational roles and 14,000 in management. Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise after the company initially estimated a combined 20,000 layoffs over the course of 2025. It’s part of a multiyear turnaround plan under CEO Carol Tomé, who took the helm in 2020, making her the first woman and company outsider to lead UPS. She has faced mounting pressure from investors and employees frustrated by the company’s underperformance and lagging stock price compared to rivals like FedEx and Amazon’s logistics arm. “2025 was a year of considerable progress for UPS as we took action to strengthen our revenue quality and build a more agile network,” Tomé said in a Tuesday statement. “Looking ahead, upon completion of the Amazon glide-down, 2026 will be an inflection point in the execution of our strategy to deliver growth and sustained margin expansion.” Amazon was previously the delivery firm’s largest customer, but the two companies are working to end their joint operations. UPS said it expects $3 billion in total savings from unwinding its business with Amazon. Shares in UPS jumped 3% Tuesday after the company announced the job cuts and released fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations – including adjusted profit of $2.6 billion and $24.5 billion in consolidated revenues.

Title: Washington Post staffers feeling 'betrayed' as turmoil, looming layoffs rock billionaire Jeff Bezos’ newsroom

Former Washington Post face checker Glenn Kessler spoke with Fox News Digital about the paper's "absentee owner" Jeff Bezos and the challenges the news outlet faces. The Washington Post has had a tumultuous few days with only more rockiness on the road ahead as the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper faces an ongoing crisis. Panic at the paper bled onto social media Monday, with staffers sounding the alarm by using the hashtag "#SaveThePost," as reports of major pending layoffs spread in the newsroom. Post leaders have been working for roughly two years to be in a position to break even financially after reported $100 million losses in 2024, and an upcoming headcount reduction is expected to help accomplish that goal. "It’s a tense period," Glenn Kessler, the Post's former fact-checker, told Fox News Digital. "Many have dedicated their professional careers to the Post and are worried an important American institution is being dismantled." WASHINGTON POST STAFFERS PLEAD WITH BILLIONAIRE OWNER JEFF BEZOS TO SAVE THE PAPER AMID MAJOR LOOMING LAYOFFS Billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. (Karwai Tang/WireImage; Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images) The Post's foreign correspondents penned a letter to the paper's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, urging him to preserve their beat as it has emerged as a high target in looming budget cuts. "We are The Washington Post’s international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper’s global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts," they wrote to Bezos. Bezos, who irked Post staffers by ignoring a petition for him to visit the newsroom when he was in town for President Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration, has not offered any recent public comment regarding the paper’s issues. On Monday, as current and former Post journalists begged Bezos to save the paper, he attended the Dior fashion show at the Musée Rodin in Paris, France. His silence has been so frustrating that employees have considered reaching out to celebrities like Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep with the hopes a Hollywood heavyweight could get his attention, according to Status. The two actors starred in "The Post," a 2017 movie about the publication of the Pentagon Papers. The sports section faced a roller coaster of its own after it was initially reported that the Post was forgoing sending any of its journalists to cover the Winter Olympics next month in Italy, a decision that was reversed on Monday following intense blowback. Like the foreign affairs beat, the sports section may also be gutted. "The Washington Post, the paper I grew up reading, is potentially considering shuttering its sports desk entirely amidst layoffs, isn’t sending baseball reporters to spring training, and in general is just going down the tubes," ESPN’s Clinton Yates, who spent nine years at the Post, said Monday on his radio show. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez at the Dior fashion show as part of Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2026 held at the Musée Rodin on Jan. 26, 2025 in Paris, France. (Swan Gallet/WWD via Getty Images) "Shutting down the sports section at the Washington Post is akin to removing a monument as far as I’m concerned," he continued. "And I think a lot of people would agree with me." New York Times reporter Peter Baker believes international and sports coverage are "two of the strongest parts" of the Post. "They have amazing must-read writers. If they are gutted by Bezos's publisher, it would be one of the most self-destructive acts in American journalism in years. Praying it's not true," Baker wrote on X. But prayers might not be enough, as the Post's former media reporter, Paul Farhi, told Fox News Digital that he heard rumors from his former colleagues that "up to 300 people" could be laid off by the next round of cuts. "I was just texting with a friend. She said it was genuinely heartbreaking," Kessler said. "Then I got [a] text from another former colleague, a star reporter. She said it was incredible that she could be laid off." NY POST, WSJ, NY TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST ALIGN AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN OVER ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS Glenn Kessler worked at The Washington Post from 1998 until 2025. (Washington Post) Kessler left the Post last summer after 27 years at the paper, taking a voluntary buyout. His former boss, Washington Post CEO and publisher Will Lewis, called for staffers who don't "feel aligned" with the new direction of the paper to consider taking the buyout. "There were many who wanted to stick with the Post and chose to stay. So they feel especially betrayed — though of course no one knows what’s really happening. Except it sounds bad," Kessler told Fox News Digital. The Post has been plagued by low morale and financial struggles for years, and there has already been a significant exodus of staffers, many of whom have taken positions at rival publications like The New York Times and The Atlantic. Bezos took heat from employees in 2024 when he abruptly axed the paper's planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for the White House, after the editorial board had previously declared Trump the worst president in modern history. The surprising decision shortly before the election sparked massive subscriber losses and a slew of staff resignations. Bezos later fueled more outrage when he announced he was overhauling its editorial pages to promote "free markets and personal liberties."

(Ernesto Ruscio/GC Images) The Amazon founder is fueling outrage once again, with headlines such as "Jeff Bezos Is Putting The Washington Post Into Hospice" popping up across the internet. Bezos is the fourth-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $250 billion, according to Forbes. Many in the media industry have long wondered why he wouldn’t reach into his pockets in order to save rank-and-file Post employees. "Jeff Bezos’ destruction of a great newspaper will be part of his legacy. #SaveThePost," famed baseball reporter Ken Rosenthal posted Monday on X. "You know what, let’s spend a little less on the boat foam wedding party and keep some f---ing reporters in Tehran," Jon Stewart quipped Monday night on "The Daily Show," referring to Bezos’ extravagant 2025 wedding that cost a reported $50 million. Others have thought it presumptuous that Bezos should continue to shell out money for a company that's losing money. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Δ The layoffs will affect about 700 workers, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Pinterest said in the filing that the move is part of a restructuring plan that supports its transformation initiatives. The plan involves moving resources to AI-focused roles and teams and “prioritizing AI-powered products and capabilities.” “Although the company is reducing its overall staffing levels with these actions in the near term, the company plans to reinvest in key development areas and strategic opportunities,” the filing said. Pinterest expects to complete the plan, which also involves scaling back its office space, by the end of the third quarter, per the filing. The company has been increasing its focus on AI for some time. On an earnings call in November, management said the platform has shifted from a digital mood board into what CEO Bill Ready called an “AI-powered visual-first shopping assistant.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue The company said at the time that AI now underpins almost every part of its platform, from search and discovery to shopping recommendations, along with the then-new conversational Pinterest Assistant. Pinterest Assistant is designed to help users find products and ideas that match their tastes, expanding the platform’s long-standing focus on inspiration into one centered on action. The assistant is aimed at making Pinterest “a more actionable destination,” combining search, personalization and shopping within one experience. At the same time, Pinterest also introduced AI-powered upgrades to its boards that produce tailored recommendations based on each user’s activity and saved Pins. Pinterest’s job cuts are the third in a series of layoffs at high-profile tech companies so far this year. Last week saw reports that Amazon was preparing to cut 14,000 corporate workers, part of its effort to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs. The latest round of cuts was reportedly concentrated on four areas, including Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and People Experience and Technology, the company’s human resources division. Earlier this month, it was reported that Meta plans to eliminate 10% of the jobs in its Reality Labs unit as it focuses less on virtual reality products and more on AI wearables.

Title: Pinterest will lay off 15% of its workforce as the platform pivots resources to AI

NEW YORK (AP) — Pinterest plans to lay off under 15% of its workforce, as part of broader restructuring that arrives as the image-sharing platform pivots more of its money to artificial intelligence. In a Tuesday securities filing, San Francisco-based Pinterest said it was making these cuts to support “transformation initiatives” — which include reallocating the company’s resources to AI-focused roles and prioritizing AI-powered products. It said it was also working to reshape its “sales and go-to-market approach.” Beyond the coming layoffs, Pinterest said it will reduce office space. The company expects to complete its restructuring plan by the end of September, incurring pretax charges of $35 million to $45 million. Pinterest’s job cuts are expected to impact hundreds of workers. As of the end of last year, Pinterest had a total headcount of about 5,200 employees, the company confirmed to The Associated Press. Like other tech and social media companies, Pinterest has accelerated its integration of AI recently, particularly in consumer-facing offerings. In October, the company introduced AI-powered updates to users’ in-platform “boards” and unveiled Pinterest Assistant, which is also powered by AI and gives users shopping recommendations. Pinterest isn’t the first company to turn to job cuts while pivoting spending to AI. Last fall, Amazon, for example, said it would cut about 14,000 corporate jobs (close to 4% of its workforce) as it ramped up AI investments while trimming costs elsewhere. Shares of Pinterest fell more than 9% as of midday trading Tuesday.

Title: Jeff Bezos Slammed For Partying in Paris With Wife Lauren Sànchez — as His Washington Post Newspaper Burns Ahead of Planned Firings

Sign up for your daily dose of dope. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sànchez partied in Paris while The Washington Post braced for more layoffs. Contact us by Email Jan. 27 2026, Published 11:25 a.m. ET Tech billionaire Jeff Bezos has been slammed for partying with his wife Lauren Sànchez in Paris for Haute Couture Week while staffers at his publication, The Washington Post, panic ahead of planned layoffs, RadarOnline.com can reveal. Staffers have reportedly begged Bezos, 62, to intervene and have taken to social media to share their stories in hopes their boss has a change of heart. Bezos and his wife attended couture fashion shows in Paris while staffers feared their jobs would be cut. While Bezos and Sànchez brushed shoulders with celebrities at couture fashion shows like Schiaparelli and Dior and posed for photos on the red carpet, staffers back home at the Washington Post were racked with anxiety wondering whether or not their jobs were on the chopping block. The publication is set to face another round of layoffs, which are believed to be rolled out in February after leadership delayed downsizing plans. Some reports estimated upwards of 300 employees could be impacted, with newsroom positions, including sports, metro and foreign affairs, taking the brunt of the force. "I've never experienced such a feeling of dread," one Post insider reportedly told an outlet. Bezos purchased The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013. Fear and uncertainty have gripped the paper as staff have been left in the dark about when the layoffs will happen and how many jobs will be axed. Managing editor Kimi Yoshino sent a memo to the sports division informing staff a correspondent would not be sent to cover the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan, Italy, which is set to kick off in less than two weeks. "We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you," the memo read, according to the Guardian. Adding to bewilderment over the decision was the fact that the Post was said to have already spent around $80,000 in preparation for covering the Winter Olympics. "It's all very confusing, and no one knows anything," said another staffer, who was not authorized to comment. "The anxiety is so sad." Hundreds of staffers, mostly from the newsroom, are expected to lose their jobs. Meanwhile, Foreign Post staff penned Bezos a letter urging him to rethink downsizing and to consider the powerful role his publication plays worldwide. "We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance – not the shared success that remains attainable," a portion of the letter signed by 60 staffers read. Among the 60 staffers who signed off on the letter were the Post's top international journalists. The group noted they were open to "finding ways to reduce our costs even further" and work with leadership "while retaining as many jobs as we can." "We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and they lose relevance," the letter added.

On social media, staff launched the hashtag "#SaveThePost" in hopes their personal stories could sway the Amazon founder from going through with the layoffs. "Hi @JeffBezos. We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team 'bada-- beacons of hope.' We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost," wrote Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O'Grady on X. "As international correspondents and reporters for the @washingtonpost, we risk our safety to investigate authoritarian governments, report from gang-controlled towns and document evidence of stolen elections. This on-the-ground reporting is more critical than ever," added Mexico City bureau chief Samantha Schmidt. "I've driven into hurricanes, trekked through jungles and camped on an ice sheet in sub-zero temperatures to bring you news about climate change," pleaded another journalist.

Title: WaPo’s Woes; TTD’s C-Suite Turnover
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/tuesday-27012026/
Time Published: 2026-01-27T05:01:53Z

Who Needs Sports? The Washington Post is bracing for massive layoffs that have employees questioning owner Jeff Bezos’s commitment to the newspaper’s long-term health, Status reports. WaPo reportedly plans to slash 100 of its 800 newsroom positions next month, with the cuts likely to primarily impact the sports, metro and foreign news teams. In total, 300 positions may be eliminated across the company. Why the layoffs? WaPo’s advertising and subscription businesses have been struggling for years. WaPo infamously lost a quarter million digital subscribers, or 10% of its subscriber base, after Bezos spiked the paper’s planned endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election. As of June, its paid print circulation was just 97,000. On top of that, Johanna Mayer-Jones, WaPo’s ad chief, was reportedly eyeing an exit back in October – although she’s still currently with the company. The decision to focus newsroom layoffs on the sports desk bodes ill for WaPo’s turnaround prospects. Its major news rivals, including The New York Times, have doubled down on sports as a way to attract advertisers that are hesitant about appearing beside hard news coverage. Oh, and the layoffs are expected to hit just as the Winter Olympics are set to begin in February. Stock In Trade The Trade Desk is dealing with all sorts of in-the-weeds programmatic drama. There’s its fierce rivalry with Amazon putting pressure on margins, not to mention in-fighting with Prebid over transaction IDs. But there’s another issue: TTD’s leadership churn. Programmatic vets surely took note of Jud Spencer’s departure in December and CRO Jed Dederick’s exit not long before that. Meanwhile, the COO role was unfilled for years before Vivek Kundra came aboard last year. And there hasn’t been a CTO since Dave Pickles left in 2023. Now, Alex Kayyal, who joined as CFO only six months ago, is stepping down, Adweek reports. TTD also had another CFO transition 18 months prior. The Trade Desk’s CFO turnover may not ring all that loudly in the programmatic space, but Wall Street investors consider it an important signal. And, indeed, TTD’s shares dropped by more than 6% after the announcement. In a research note, Wells Fargo wrote that the news about Kayyal only adds to TTD’s “continued fundamental and narrative volatility.” Losing the narrative, as they say, barely registers in third-party programmatic. Favorable headlines about Amazon DSP can stack to the sky without much affecting TTD’s actual performance. But when the Wall Street narrative breaks, it goes straight to the market cap. The Ads Add Up Few places are pricier to run ads than the Las Vegas Sphere or during an NFL game – unless, apparently, you’re buying a placement in ChatGPT. That’s right. Scarcely a week after OpenAI announced its plan to launch ads in the coming weeks, ChatGPT has reportedly set a baseline CPM of approximately $60, according to The Information. That price rivals some of the most coveted inventory out there. Sixty bucks would be at the high end for a YouTube campaign, while CPMs on Meta, by comparison, are often in the $10 to $20 range. And OpenAI doesn’t even have an attribution or a pixel network to track and credit conversions. On the other hand, recall that Netflix launched with a $60 CPM baseline, which has long since rationalized to $30 or less. Being among the earliest advertisers in ChatGPT will no doubt carry some bragging rights, sure. Just imagine all the screenshots and organic sharing those ads will generate. Still, The Information writes, with OpenAI’s ads business in its infancy, “many advertisers will likely hold off on devoting significant parts of their budgets to ChatGPT ads until they see whether those ads are driving sales.” Not everyone is willing to shell out for a shiny object. But Wait! There’s More! Inside the debate over agentic advertising and standards. [Digiday] How MrBeast Burger, the YouTuber’s eponymous food and delivery brand, went so very wrong.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: The Trade Desk’s CFO search indicates a tough road ahead for independents

Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → After a rocky 2025, ad tech entities, particularly “independents,” are taking measures to steady the ship in the coming 12 months, with the exit of The Trade Desk’s CFO (its second in six months) the most high-profile example. Earlier this week, The Trade Desk announced the exit of Alex Kayyal, the demand-side platform’s finance chief who has been in role since August 2025 and served on its board from the February prior to that, topping off what’s been a tumultuous 12 months. The Trade Desk’s chief accounting officer Tahnil Davis will serve as interim CFO, while the search for a more permament replacement is conducted. The termination of such a senior executive after a short time in office raises questions – NewStreet Research’s Dan Salmon has a concise analysis – with The Trade Desk’s share price plunging 5% in the early hours after the January 2026 announcement. The departure also echoes similar moves from other DSPs, including layoffs at challengers in the sector such as Yahoo in earlier months, with sources telling Digiday the moves were signs of a financially challenging 2025 for the sector. A November survey from Digiday Research noted the marked rise of Amazon’s DSP, with the results showing that decline of The Trade Desk – dropping from 55% in Q1 2024, to 29% Q3, 2025 – contrasting with the rise of the e-commerce giant’s fortunes – shooting up from 29% to 50% during the same period. Of course, the rise of Amazon contrasting with the rocky fortunes of independent DSPs helps resurface “the Open Internet vs. Wall Gardens” debate, although, a report released this month point to a wind in the sail of the latter. According to a report from Winterberry Group, which characterizes the following 12 months as one of “continuous evolution” as opposed to runaway growth or sudden contraction, with advertising spend projected to grow to $664 billion in 2026, up 9.4% year over year when political advertising is included. However, in a market that is stabilizing after several years of volatility, while also undergoing structural change driven by AI, marketers are being asked to “do more with the same,” per Winterberry’s researchers. All of this means performance advertising will likely be marketers’ cause célèbre in the months ahead as their peers in the finance department ask for immediate results for their marketing investment, making the jobs of sales staff at platform-providers – read Amazon, Google and Meta, etc. – equipped black boxes primed to take further advantage. “According to a reputable leaker on TeamBlind; the layoffs are pushed right one day- i.e. 28 JAN 2026 [sic] is purportedly the new day. Everything else should be consistent/correct.” — As Amazon is expected to follow up on its series of 2025 layoffs, reputedly preparing to cut 30,000 jobs, ahead of its Feb. 5 earnings call, one anonymous source forecasts the precise date the axe will fall. Bold Call: OpenAI’s ads pivot may come too little, too late OpenAI is set to wade into the advertising business this year, but its move to finally monetize ChatGPT with ad dollars may have come a touch too late. The top AI platforms for publishers, ranked Two years after OpenAI signed its first content licensing deal with Axel Springer, the field of AI platforms doing business with publishers has expanded exponentially. Especially just in the past year. OpenAI CFO defends ads in ChatGPT as ‘strong business model’ OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar defended the company’s addition of ads to its popular chatbot ChatGPT as a way to democratize access to artificial intelligence, while speaking at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. YouTube is reaching a ‘tipping point’ in convincing advertisers it really is TV A research study released this month by Pixability found that in a survey of 288 media agency professionals, finding 62% of US agencies and 85% of UK agencies plan to include YouTube in their CTV ad buys this year.

Title: Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos | Analysis
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T21:48:32Z
Full Content:
Rumors of cuts to the international, metro and sports desks are leaving journalists “twisting in the wind” and prompting unusually public appeals to ownership As the Washington Post newsroom braces for layoffs, journalists took their case public on Monday, turning to social media to urge mega-billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to support the paper’s robust and storied foreign coverage. “Hi @JeffBezos,” Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O’Grady wrote on X. “We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team ‘badass beacons of hope.’ We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost.” Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati, who covers Iran for the paper, also tweeted directly to Bezos, saying she wants “nothing more than to keep doing this important work,” while White House bureau chief Matt Viser wrote that “it’s impossible to overstate how much we rely upon” the international desk and “how diminished we’d be without them.” The public appeals on Monday speak to fears inside the paper that significant cuts are on the horizon — particularly in international coverage — and reflect growing doubts about whether Bezos, the Amazon founder reportedly worth around $250 billion, remains fully invested in supporting the paper. The Post, which reportedly lost around $100 million in 2024, went through a painful round of buyouts last year, and staffers worry that further cuts at the start of 2026 could deepen the turmoil at a time when rigorous coverage of global conflict and crisis feels more essential than ever. [Layoffs will] reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” In conversations with TheWrap, staffers expressed frustration with Bezos’ seeming distance from the paper, as well as with CEO and publisher Will Lewis, whose widely touted “third newsroom” initiative never gained traction amid broader upheaval during his two-year tenure. They also fault management for the loss of hundreds of thousands of subscribers after the paper spiked a 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. “If their answer to those losses is to take it out on staff now, what are we doing?” asked a staffer. “The lack of communication has left folks twisting in the wind,” another staffer told TheWrap, adding that “many people aren’t sure if they’ll have jobs next week.” The Post’s precarious state contrasts sharply from a decade ago, when it was among the standout publications during Donald Trump’s first term, with the paper, under then-executive editor Marty Baron, landing major scoops and adopting the motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Even as the Post continues to deliver dogged coverage of Trump’s second administration, Bezos’ cozier relationship with the president and his remaking of the opinion section around “personal liberties and free markets” have raised concerns about whether he remains as committed to holding the administration accountable. It wasn’t lost on staffers that Bezos didn’t publicly comment on the FBI’s search of a Post reporter’s home earlier this month, even as he found time to tweet about Polymarket. At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios reportedly paid $40 million for the licensing rights to a new Melania Trump documentary — which was screened Saturday night at the White House — while Amazon is among the corporate donors to Trump’s ballroom project. Foreign correspondents pleaded with Bezos over the weekend, urging him in a letter to “preserve our newspaper’s global coverage.” They reminded Bezos how he told staff, upon buying the paper in 2013, that being “profitable and shrinking” is “a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.” A third staffer told TheWrap, “If Bezos cares a little bit about this newspaper, and wants this paper to get back to the golden days under the leadership of Marty Baron, then he needs to make changes at the top.” Foreign reporting has long been one of the Post’s hallmarks, stretching back to Pulitzer Prize-winning work by the likes of David Remnick and the late Anthony Shadid, and extending to more recent coverage of ISIS, the Israel-Hamas war, Ukraine, Iran and Venezuela. That legacy is now colliding with deep uncertainty inside the newsroom, where rumors swirl that not only foreign coverage, but sports and metro desk teams are on the chopping block. Potential layoffs on the international desk are particularly unnerving, not only because of the Post’s legacy, but because some foreign journalists rely on the paper for U.S. visas — or to continue reporting from the countries they cover. Proud to be colleagues with fearless @washingtonpost international reporters. @JeffBezos, their work is absolutely core to the newspaper and vitally important to my own job covering the White House and foreign policy. #SaveThePost https://t.co/Q7im59ol9o Foreign correspondents have been told not to travel to crisis zones after Feb. 1, which fueled speculation that management wants U.S.-based staff at home ahead of potential layoffs next month. On Friday, the Post also abruptly canceled plans to send a contingent to cover the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games, which kick off on Feb. 6. Though the specter of layoffs has loomed for some time, “cutting Olympics coverage at the last minute did shock a lot of staff,” the second staffer told TheWrap. “It all feels more serious and urgent now.” TheWrap learned Monday that the Post now plans to send four journalists to the games, as opposed to the more than a dozen originally expected. A Post spokesperson confirmed the Olympics plan. “Perhaps the cuts aren’t as bad as rumored,” added the second staffer. “But if they are, it’ll reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” Turning out the lights on ambitious, hard-hitting international coverage would give a stark new meaning to the Post’s long-standing warning that “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Corbin Bolies contributed reporting for this story.

Title: Washington Post Correspondents Start “Save The Post” Social Media Campaign Amid Fears Of Massive Layoffs

By Ted Johnson Political Editor Staffers at the Washington Post have started to post messages on social media to “Save The Post,” amid fears that the Jeff Bezos-owned publication is on the cusp of implementing massive layoffs. A number of foreign correspondents posted messages Monday as speculation swirled that the international coverage will bear a substantial amount of cuts. A sample: Correspondent Yeganeh Torbati wrote on X, “@jeffbezos I cover Iran for @washingtonpost. Since June, I’ve reported on US/Israeli strikes, a dire water crisis, state coercion of the private sector, and now, horrific govt violence against protesters. I want nothing more than to keep doing this important work.” Correspondent Loveday Morris, who covers the Middle East, wrote, “Today a source warned me that my reporting lines could have me killed. Just an average day as a foreign correspondent. I can’t count the number of times I’ve come under fire or had windows rattle from blasts. Our international staff risk so much to bring home news.” Related Stories News Bari Weiss Unveils Her Strategy For CBS News, Tells Staffers Of Need To Shift To "Streaming Mentality" & To Highlight "Political Friction" Of National Debate News Joe Biden Decries Alex Pretti, Renee Good Shooting Deaths By Federal Agents: "We Are Not A Nation That Guns Down Our Citizens In The Street" The New York Times reported that foreign correspondents sent a letter to Bezos, urging him to retain the coverage. Watch on Deadline The Post has not commented on pending layoffs. “We know what happens when newspapers slash their international sections: they lose reach and lose relevance,” the correspondents wrote. “… The newsroom depends on our authority, cultivated through face-to-face source meetings around the world — work that simply cannot be replicated from Washington.” There also has been concern about the sports staff at the Post after a memo, obtained by Semafor, went out from Managing Editor Kimi Yoshino informing them that a contingent would not be sent to cover the Winter Olympics next month. A Post spokesperson confirmed a Times report that, in a reversal, a smaller contingent would be sent. The Post has already gone through multiple rounds of job cuts and buyouts in recent years, a contrast from years of growth after Bezos bought the publication in 2013. The Post suffered from a loss of subscribers following Bezos’ decision to nix an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. He later shifted the strategy of the opinion pages, leading to an exodus of editors and columnists. The Amazon founder said that the opinion content would focus on the “defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.” “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote.

Amazon layoffs: Amazon is executing a historic pivot this January 2026. To fuel a $35 billion quarterly AI surge, the tech giant is cutting 14,000 corporate roles. CEO Andy Jassy frames this as a "bureaucracy tax" removal. While Capex jumped 55%, AWS growth has re-accelerated to 20%. Investors are watching closely as Amazon trades management layers for custom AI silicon. This strategy prioritizes long-term efficiency over immediate retail margins.

Title: Amazon layoffs to begin tomorrow? Key sectors that could be impacted

E-commerce giant Amazon is planning a second round of layoffs this week, with a broader aim of trimming its corporate workforce by about 30,000, Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. In the second round, the total job cuts are expected to be roughly the same as last year and could start as early as Tuesday, 27 January, the people told the news portal. In October last year, the company cut around 14,000 white-collar jobs, nearly half of the 30,000. Employees in Amazon Web Services, retail, Prime Video, and the People Experience and Technology HR units are expected to be affected, the report said. However, the full extent of the impact remains unclear, while Amazon's plans could still change. The Seattle-based retailer giant cited the first round of job cuts in October on the rise of artificial intelligence software, saying in an internal letter that “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Later, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings call that the reduction was “not really financially driven and it’s not even really AI-driven.” Rather, he said, “it’s culture," meaning the company has too much bureaucracy. “You end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. Jassy had previously stated in 2025 that he anticipated Amazon’s corporate workforce would decrease over time due to efficiencies gained from the use of AI. Major companies are increasingly using AI to write code for their software and adopting AI agents that automate routine tasks, as they look to save costs and cut reliance on people, the report said. Amazon touted its latest AI models during its annual AWS cloud computing conference in December. The entire 30,000 jobs would constitute a small part of Amazon’s 1.58 million employees, accounting for nearly 10% of the company's corporate staff. Most of Amazon’s workforce is employed in fulfilment centres and warehouses. It would be the biggest layoff in Amazon’s 30-year history. The company cut around 27,000 jobs in 2022. In October last year, affected workers were told they would remain on the payroll for 90 days, during which time they could apply for internal jobs or seek other employment. That period expires on Monday. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint. Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates.

Title: Job Slaughter Accelerates: January 2026 Corporate Layoffs Signal Economic Implosion

The American economic mirage is shattering. As the nation enters 2026, a chilling corporate offensive is accelerating, transforming the post-holiday landscape into a bloodbath for the working class. This is not a routine economic adjustment; it is the sound of systemic collapse, a coordinated corporate retreat from the very human capital upon which national prosperity was built. The statistics are damning. Over 100 U.S. companies have already filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) acts this January aloneÂ [1]. This widespread announcement of planned job cuts reveals a strategic, panicked withdrawal from workforce commitments. From the heartland's food producers to the coastal tech titans, thousands of livelihoods are being extinguished with the cold efficiency of a balance sheet calculation, signaling a deliberate and catastrophic economic implosion engineered from the top. A Sudden, Chilling Acceleration January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence. The era of trusting centralized power is over; the era of decentralized self-reliance has begun.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. January 2026 has witnessed an unprecedented, sharp escalation in mass layoffs, far exceeding any typical seasonal downturn. This wave represents a decisive shift from isolated corporate restructurings to a broad-based purge. The sheer scale and synchrony indicate a systemic failure, not individual corporate misfortune. As noted by economic observers, when layoffs accelerate across sectors, it reveals deeper structural rotÂ [2]. This coordinated action suggests a shared corporate directive: shed human labor at all costs to appease shareholders and chase the phantom of digital efficiency, regardless of the human devastation left behind. The Anatomy of a Collapse: This Week's Casualties The human cost of this corporate calculus is no longer abstract. It is felt in shuttered plants and shattered communities. Tyson Foods, a pillar of the agricultural industry, has closed a major pork processing plant in Nebraska, instantly eliminating 3,200 jobs as part of a broader purge affecting 4,900 workers. Such moves devastate local economies that were built around these employers. Beneath the headlines of corporate giants, a quieter slaughter continues. The elimination of 500 jobs at Bajaj Mobility and 100 at Thomas Storey Fabrications may not make national news, but they represent the same brutal logic playing out across the industrial landscape. Corporate spokespeople frame these decisions as necessary 'efficiencies' or 'restructuring.' In reality, they represent a fundamental betrayal of worker loyalty and a conscious decision to abandon economic stability for short-term financial metrics. This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control.

This mirrors the historical precedent set in the 1980s, where mass layoffs became an accepted tool for corporate leaders to guard against short-term disruption, with devastating long-term consequences for worker security and trustÂ [3]. The Broader Slaughter: Tech, Auto, and Retail Lead the Retreat The collapse is not isolated to manufacturing; it is a contagion sweeping every consumer-facing sector. The technology industry, once a beacon of innovation, is now leading the charge in abandoning its workforce. Amazon is reportedly planning another 30,000 job cuts, while Meta continues its purge with 1,500 layoffs in its Reality Labs divisionÂ [4]. This reveals an industry that has pivoted from human-driven innovation to a single-minded obsession with AI and shareholder returns. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control. The path forward requires a fundamental rejection of this corrupt, centralized model. The solution lies in decentralization, local self-reliance, and a return to honest money systems. As financial uncertainty grows, assets with intrinsic value and no counter-party risk become essential. Historically, gold and silver have served as a hedge against systemic failure and currency devaluationÂ [12]. In a digital world pushing for total control, physical precious metals represent a form of analog, private wealth preservation that cannot be censored or erased by a keystroke. To survive the coming upheaval, individuals must empower themselves with knowledge from uncensored sources, build community resilience, and sever dependence on the very corporations and institutions that are now discarding them. Platforms likeÂ Brighteon.AIÂ offer AI-powered research free from corporate narrative control, while resources for natural health and preparedness provide the tools for true independence.

Mike Adams interview with Andy Schectman. Mike Adams. May 13 2025. The automotive sector exposes another broken promise. General Motors' elimination of 1,140 jobs at its flagship electric vehicle plant in Michigan lays bare the fragility of government-backed 'green transition' industries. When subsidies and political winds shift, the jobs vanish, leaving workers stranded. The list of companies filing WARN notices reads like a who's who of American consumerism: Nike, FedEx, Nordstrom, Warner MusicÂ [5]. This sweep across retail, logistics, and entertainment proves the economic disease is universal. The logistics sector has been particularly hard hit, with UPS and FedEx combined accounting for over 58,000 layoffs recentlyÂ [6]. The foundation of the consumer economy is being dismantled. The Real Drivers: Shareholder Greed, AI Obsession, and Policy Failure Corporate apologists and captured economists cite 'macroeconomic uncertainty' as the cause. This is a deliberate obfuscation. The primary driver is a pathological corporate obsession with short-term shareholder value and stock buybacks, prioritized entirely over long-term investment in human capital and community stability. Simultaneously, the frantic rush to adopt Artificial Intelligence is not primarily about efficiency; it is a strategic depopulation-of-labor strategy. As one AI expert starkly observed in an interview, humanity faces a critical choice as AI drives the 'mass replacement of cognitive jobs,' rendering computer-based desk jobs obsoleteÂ [7]. This is not innovation for human betterment; it is automation for human replacement, a goal actively pursued by globalist corporations viewing workers as liabilities. This implosion was engineered by years of disastrous government policy. Rogue energy policies crushed domestic competitiveness, making energy-intensive operations untenableÂ [8]. At the same time, aggressive monetary policies and trade wars have created unbearable pressure. The escalating U.S.-China trade war, characterized by extreme tariffs, has triggered severe economic pressure and factory closures not only abroad but also strains the domestic supply chain, forcing panicked corporate retreatsÂ [9][10]. The corporate elite are adept at navigatingâand exploitingâsuch political turmoil for their own ends, often at the expense of the workforceÂ [11]. Conclusion: Beyond the Headlines Lies a Deliberate Human Catastrophe The January 2026 layoff wave is not a natural economic cycle. It is a controlled demolition of the American workforce and middle-class stability. These corporations, often protected by symbiotic and corrupt government agencies, are executing a coldly rational plan that sacrifices human dignity at the altar of digital efficiency and centralized control.

Title: Jeff Bezos attends Trump movie night as WaPo reporters beg for their jobs: report
URL: https://www.rawstory.com/jeff-bezos-2675023599/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T22:38:19Z
Full Content:
Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, attended the premiere of "Melania," a $40 million documentary about the first lady, with President Donald Trump on Saturday night as his reporters begged him not to make steep cuts to the legendary newsroom, according to a new report. David Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent, reported on Sunday that WaPo's international correspondents sent Bezos a letter pleading with him to maintain the paper's international coverage. The letter was sent as speculation was building that large-scale layoffs were imminent at the paper. "We urge you to consider how these proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable," the letter reads in part. The letter was sent the day after Bezos attended the White House movie night. According to Folkenflik, Melania Trump was paid the "lion's share" of the $40 million licensing fee for Amazon Prime, which is owned by Bezos, to produce the documentary. Trump has become increasingly hostile to the press during his second term. He has called publications that report on his health "illegal" and said they should be shut down.

TNT Sports Box Office has exclusive broadcast rights to UFC 324 in the UK, with the PPV rate set at £19.99.

Title: I was laid off from CrowdStrike and used AI to send 800 applications in a month to land my ideal role

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike. I went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon. That's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff. I was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a "great résumé."

Little did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit. In the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it. At first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked. Instead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called "The Reboot Era," where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences. Even with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, "Should I update my résumé for this role?" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls. LinkedIn "Easy Apply" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked. At first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house. A week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me. Over the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters. With AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast. In total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer. That's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase. AI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person. I think the job market is going in the wrong direction. First, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand. If the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions. None of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back. Jump to
