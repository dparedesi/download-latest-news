Title: 'Entitled,' 'complacent,' and 'sloppy': Inside the workplace tension at the world's largest HR organization

On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. The brief performance, which took place in a conference room with about 75 employees, came after remarks honoring the 24th anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. SHRM has been embroiled in controversy in recent years. Some of these challenges have gripped workplaces across the country, including regular layoffs and restructurings and debates over DEI. Other elements, however, set SHRM apart. They include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a "conservative" dress code that referenced "enclothed cognition" and bans sequins; an employment discrimination lawsuit set to go to trial in December; and a company-wide meeting in which CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr. said some staffers were "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Revenue grew from $131 million in 2017 to $233 million last year, according to public tax filings. It has 413 employees today, up from 387 in December 2017. This article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former SHRM employees and nearly a dozen current and former members, as well as legal and tax filings and government records. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. SHRM was founded in 1948 and today describes itself as "the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces." Former staffers characterized it as a punitive workplace. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. A memo sent to SHRM's brand and marketing staff in January laid out a dress code that included a lengthy introduction about "enclothed cognition," a term that refers to the notion that the clothing workers wear impacts their performance. The code required staff to dress in "conservative" business attire and prohibited items such as sneakers, denim, skorts, sequins, hats, and clothing that doesn't cover the area between the shoulders and knees. Burke said "SHRM offers employees the flexibility to arrive between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." and noted that the workplace is remote Mondays and Fridays. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "Literally, I've not told anyone, because I've been trying to figure out where I was going to land, and I've landed on a decision," Taylor said. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. There will be a total reorg … And this is not a decision that I've made again with anyone, no one." His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. SHRM cut staff earlier this month. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." In his statement, Taylor said November's "organizational redesign is about shifting for the future, not reacting to the past," adding that the cuts were not due to financial strain and that the organization has an "enviable balance sheet." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. In some cases, full teams were let go. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." "That's on us — and we've corrected it. We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. Repeated layoffs can be a sign of poor leadership, said Herd, the former head of HR for North America at McKinsey. SHRM is "literally describing themselves as experts in all things work and selling best practices in talent planning. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. It rings hollow to put the blame ostensibly on the people you chose to hire." "Whether they like it or not, they are held to a higher standard because they've put themselves out there as the preeminent expert on work." "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Daniel Burchfield, who joined SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation in 2024, said performance issues were cited in his February termination. But he said he hadn't been reprimanded or put on a performance improvement plan. "Nothing negative was indicated to me," he said. Two weeks before his termination, Burchfield said he told his manager he was worried about layoffs. He said the manager replied that SHRM likes to maintain an atmosphere of fear to drive performance. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." SHRM itself has said as much. "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. "They do the opposite of what they preach." Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. Last year, a judge called the case "messy" and said the evidence showed that the same HR person tasked with investigating Mohamed's complaints was also ghostwriting emails for Mohamed's boss and drafting Mohamed's termination paperwork around the same time. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. We know the facts, and we trust the process." Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. Workplace-discrimination lawsuits rarely get this far, he said. Further, SHRM didn't bring an independent investigator to oversee its internal probe into the matter, the court found. This is "far from best practices," Fray-Witzer said. In response to questions from Mohamed's lawyers, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, SHRM made DEI a focus of its educational materials. In 2021, a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by SHRM concluded that company leaders should make DEI a strategic priority. It said that DEI is not only "the right thing to do," but research shows DEI leaders outperform their competitors financially. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. SHRM spent $1 million to $2 million annually on lobbying in recent years, US Senate filings show. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the American Heart Association was "a valued member" and said SHRM looks "forward to continuing to explore ways of working with them in the future." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. Starbuck has repeatedly called DEI "poison." At the event, he said he believes "equity" is a "Marxist concept." "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "They claim this is a free exchange of ideas and they're just trying to bring different opinions," she said. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Not all SHRM members opposed Starbuck's participation. Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. He said he believed HR leaders need to understand the full corporate landscape, even when it might be uncomfortable. In a statement to Business Insider, Starbuck said he spent two hours taking photos with conference attendees after he finished speaking. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. Membership revenue increased in 2024, from $69 million to $75.6 million, according to its tax filings. Figures for 2025 aren't yet available. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor's total compensation has also grown. He received $4 million last year, more than five times what he made in 2018 and a 48% increase from what he was paid in 2022. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. The fund said Smith had been insubordinate. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. The student wrote that his acceptance was rescinded because of his hairstyle and called the policy "discriminatory, sexist, and contrary to TMCF's mission of supporting" students from historically Black colleges and universities. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times. Kinsey said the group's treatment of its workers shows "hypocrisy," while Schmidt compared his work at SHRM to "the marketing department for the Death Star." "I highly encourage you to never give a dollar to this organization," Schmidt said in one video. It was filmed in SHRM's offices. Have a tip? Know more? Reach Sarah E.

Title: I was laid off by Meta and became a boomerang employee 3 years later. Here's why I decided to return.

Every time Agnes publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Devang Sharma, a 27-year-old senior software engineer at Meta, based in Menlo Park, CA. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The first time I joined Meta was in 2022. I uprooted my life in London and moved to Toronto to work there. I stayed for around four and a half months before being laid off. Meta is an amazing organization, one I saw myself retiring at, but there was nothing I could do to keep my job. Three years later, a recruiter from Meta reached out to me, and I had the chance to rejoin the company in a much more senior role. I had offers from other AI companies, but returning to Meta felt like a homecoming. With the direction of the industry, there's always a chance of layoffs; however, I saw coming back as a trade-off. I was working at a startup as an engineer before I applied for the Meta software engineering position in Toronto. When I was impacted by company layoffs, it was really challenging to deal with, especially as an immigrant. It was the middle of winter, and I had just left everything I knew behind in London. But I was still grateful for the first experience I had working at such a large scale. I was not dependent on Meta for my immigration status because I got my permanent residency, so I was free to switch jobs. Within a month, I secured several offers and landed a new role. There are LinkedIn groups, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and email newsletters for former Meta employees. I was always in touch with the former and current employees I worked with, as well as those I had not worked with directly. The conversations were mostly regarding what's happening across the industry and also within Meta. With the recent movements and investments in AI, a lot has changed over the past two and a half to three years. Meta has an internal system that tracks and enables them to reach out to current and former employees. A Meta recruiter emailed me about a specific role and team, and when I got more details about the position, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for. The interviews were similar to my first time interviewing with them in terms of coding standards and system design, but more complex in terms of tangible design problems. I was in the interview process with other organizations and considering their offers. This made me sort of unsure whether to proceed with Meta. Before rejoining Meta, I was working at Amazon. Although I had the opportunity to work with some great AI models, I was not directly contributing to the foundational models or writing the models myself. My role was primarily focused on implementing and fine-tuning. When I discovered that I could contribute to the domain of artificial intelligence firsthand by building and writing models, not just on the implementation side, which perfectly aligned with what I was looking for, I was thrilled. I'm in my 20s and I don't have a family. I'm pretty flexible in terms of my responsibilities. I couldn't sit back and be fearful about what would happen if there were more layoffs. There will probably be some, but I can't control it. I would've regretted not taking a chance to work on something amazing, simply because I chose a safe route. I had such a mixture of emotions going into my new hire orientation, this time at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park. It brought back all the memories of my first time joining the company back in Toronto. I knew that employees who worked at headquarters got to meet people like Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Meta, and other C-suite executives. Back in 2022, at the Toronto office, we were just watching them on video. In 2025, I was sitting in the front row while Chris Cox gave an amazing speech. Things have changed since I last worked here. Priorities differ, and the company is leaner, so things move more quickly. The company's evolution in terms of shipping features is happening at a very fast pace; it's no longer a traditional software engineering role. It's more about how integrated we are with AI. Whenever you're returning to a previous organization that you have worked with, it feels like a homecoming because there's naturally some attachment there. My piece of advice would be to try to come in with the mindset of a newbie. I'm using my previous experience to help me, but I'm also thinking of this new experience as if I were joining Meta for the first time. This approach has helped me overcome my prejudices. It's given me a chance to be a curious learner, and that's one of the most important things that you can do as a professional. Do you have a story to share about being a boomerang employee?

Title: Amazon Layoffs: Four In 10 Employees Were Engineers In Latest 14,000 Job Cuts, WARN Data Shows

Amazon Inc has done the largest workforce reduction in its history, which hit the engineering roles the most. Four in 10 employees were engineers in the latest 14,000 job cuts, WARN data showed. The company announced the layoffs on October, 2025. The move impacted all segments of its business, from cloud services, to retail, advertising, and groceries. Amazon Inc submitted the records of job reduction for New York, California, New Jersey, Washington, and show how sharply engineering was affected. Around 40% were in engineering positions of the 4,700 layoffs recorded in the state, according to data Amazon provided through Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings. WARN data showed that the cuts affected engineers at various levels but disproportionately hit software development engineering staff or the mid-level software developers. The layoffs affected more than 500 product managers and programme managers across states that field notice. They account for 10% of the total job cuts. Another section which bore the hardest hit was the gamining segment. California's WARM data showed that significant reduction in its San Diego and Irvine Studios as well as central publishing. There is no data for other states, which indicates that the figure is only a part of wider cuts. The workforce reduction happened as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy continued to overhaul for the company's internal culture. Amazon said that the artificial intelligence was not the main reason behind the layoffs. The company has reduced the workforce to reduce layers, speeding up decisions. Another wave of job cut is due on January, 2026.

Title: Amazon Ring Workers Ordered to Relocate Amid ‘AI-Powered’ Push

(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring division has ordered hundreds of customer service workers to relocate to central hubs in the US and UK amid a companywide push to streamline and automate operations. The affected personnel, who have been working remotely, will have to report to offices in Hawthorne, California; North Reading, Massachusetts; Tempe, Arizona; or London, according to a memo sent earlier this month and reviewed by Bloomberg. Hundreds of workers will have to relocate to keep their jobs, according to two people familiar with the matter. In the memo, Amazon’s video doorbell unit said it was looking to transform the customer service department into a “proactive, AI-powered support ecosystem.” A subset of workers who deal directly with customers, along with their supervisors, can still work remotely, the memo said. The department also supports Amazon’s Blink camera and home security brand. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the relocation requirement and declined to comment further. In June, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI tools capable of performing human tasks would likely shrink the company’s workforce. Four months later, Amazon announced it was eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. The latest job cuts roiled a workforce already grappling with several previous rounds of layoffs and an order to return to the office five days a week. Some employees see the relocation and return-to-office policies as efforts to force people to quit without Amazon having to pay severance. The company denies that and estimated in October that severance costs had reached $2 billion this year as of Sept. 30. Ring’s relocation mandate will likely prompt a large number of customer-service staff to leave, according to one affected employee, who requested anonymity to avoid possible retaliation. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company as CEO earlier this year and has made clear that AI will play an important role in its future. --With assistance from Matt Day.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Legal Notices, EEO Report, Ad Choices, Public Inspection File Contact, KWTV Public Inspection File, KSBI Public Inspection File, Closed Captioning Assistance, FCC Applications, VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month. The shutdown has left holes in more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. © 2025 Griffin Media.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Tech giant’s mega job-cut drive eliminated this one specific role the most, data shows

Amazon had in October announced that it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees. The Amazon layoffs, its largest in three years, have affected every part of the company's businesses — rom cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. However, one job category saw the most impact — engineers. According to a report by CNBC citing documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington, about 40% of the nearly 4,700 job cuts in these places were engineering roles. Amazon, which joined several other big tech companies in announcing major layoffs, reported the data in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies. The filings, which represent a segment of the data, show that the Amazon layoffs in October impacted a mix of software engineer levels. However, SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were affected disproportionately. This comes despite human resources chief Beth Galetti said in her memo announcing the Amazon layoffs mentioned that the company now specifically needs engineers as it moves on to manage work with fewer people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she added. According to the report by CNBC quoting WARN data, over 500 product managers and program managers were laid off after the October announcement, representing more than 10% of the total job cuts. Senior manager and principal level roles were also eliminated as part of the layoffs at Amazon. Amazon had in October announced that it will cut 14,000 job roles across divisions. The corporate workforce of Amazon comprises about 350,000 personnel, meaning the 14,000 cuts announced in October represent about 4% of that headcount. “The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, had said in a blog post. CEO Andy Jassy had repeatedly said he was determined to cut management layers and ease bureaucracy that began afflicting Amazon after a pandemic-era hiring binge.

Title: GOP should focus on young voters’ problems – or lose big time

By Andy Schlafly November 20, 2025 Hard times have hit young Americans, who are a pivotal voting bloc. Jobs are scarce, housing is unaffordable, student debt is suffocating, and foreign labor has taken away opportunities from American workers. A downturn in the hiring of college graduates leaves the class of 2026 victims facing the weakest job market in five years. A National Association of Colleges and Employers survey found that 51% of employers rate the job market for college grads as “poor” or merely “fair,” and only 2% said it is “excellent.” This does not bode well on Election Day for the GOP. The landslide victory by socialist Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City was propelled by young voters, despite warnings that electing him would be a big mistake. Polling indicates that 75% of young voters in New York City cast their ballots for Mamdani, and there was a surge in youth turnout. The blowout victories by Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia were also propelled by sharp increases in turnout by young voters.

The redistricting ballot initiative in California to send more Democrats to Congress was enacted with 80% support by young voters, and a large turnout by them. While some of this is due to a superior get-out-the-vote operation by leftist groups, young people are struggling financially today. Young adults should not face astronomical costs for health insurance, as they are mostly healthy and typically need coverage against only catastrophic losses. They should be able to purchase low-cost health insurance that is not dependent on their employer, so that they do not lose it when they are laid off or switch jobs. Young adults are vastly overpaying for health insurance, as they are required to fund costly care they typically never need. The current system of tying tax breaks to employer-based health insurance no longer works, as the record 14.8% of American-born, working-age men who lack a job has increased from 4.2% in 1960. Young men today are additionally burdened by gambling debts, due to the explosion in sports gambling that is heavily promoted with advertising. One out of every four of these men is unable to pay a bill because of his gambling losses. Only 44% of young voters aged 18-29 have any investments in the stock market, so news of Wall Street records does not help with that demographic. Most of those voters are in debt. In an interview with Tucker Carlson weeks before he was assassinated, Charlie Kirk explained how debt has radicalized the young generation. Kirk explained that in the 1970s and 1980s, the price of a home was about three times the average income. Today, the price of a home is as high as seven times the average income. The average age of a first-time homeowner has increased by 10 years, from 30 to 40, and people are marrying later, perhaps likewise due to economic difficulties. “Gen Z owes the most money in any generation in history,” warned Charlie Kirk in the interview. He added that young adults are not living beyond their means, but “most are actually doing this to meet their means.” Verizon just announced its biggest layoff ever, cutting loose a breathtaking 15,000 jobs. Layoffs by large, typically profitable corporations just reached their highest level for an October in 22 years. Ending the racket of allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners to continue to take jobs away from American college graduates would help. For fiscal year 2025, the four highest exploiters of H-1B visas for foreigners are Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft and Google. Private equity is a culprit in increasing costs and eliminating jobs, and Republicans are allowing Democrats like Mamdani to take the lead in scrutinizing predatory practices. Mamdani picked as co-chair of his transition team Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair who investigated private equity tactics. Toys “R” Us was a well-liked retailer employing 31,000 people, until private equity acquired it in a leveraged buyout. Private equity typically loads its target with debt, and a company acquired in this way is 10 times more likely to go bankrupt as Toys “R” Us then did. Other companies that spiraled downward into bankruptcy after being acquired by private equity include Red Lobster restaurants, Payless shoes, Party City, Sears, Envision Healthcare and the multi-state hospital system Steward Health Care. Each time this happens, jobs and healthy competition are lost, and prices increase. An estimated 40% of emergency rooms in our country are controlled by private equity firms, and deaths increased as a result. Billed charges for visiting an emergency room are far higher, even after adjusting for inflation, than a generation ago. Republicans should address the economic hardship of young voters as a high priority to have any chance of electoral success.

Title: Verizon Begins Laying Off Thousands of Workers

Reading time 2 minutes Telecom giant Verizon has begun laying off some 13,000 employees as part of a new reorganization initiative. Approximately a week ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering job cuts. Now, the layoffs have begun, according to an email viewed by Gizmodo. “Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,” wrote Verizon’s new-ish CEO, Dan Schulma, in an email sent Thursday and shared with Gizmodo (the Journal originally reported on the email). “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” the top executive added. Yes, to “delight” customers, the company must apparently very much not delight its workforce. Schulman, who took over the top spot in October, said in the email that the layoffs would reduce Verizon’s “outsourced and outside labor expenses.” To help the workers who are losing their jobs, Verizon has established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund, Schulman said. This fund will “focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps,” he shared. The CEO added that technological change was sweeping through the economy. “Changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries,” he wrote. “Change is necessary, but it can be difficult—especially when it affects valued teammates. It’s important that we direct our energy and resources to set Verizon on a path to success. The actions we’re taking are designed to make us faster and more focused, positioning our company to deliver for our customers while continuing to capture new growth opportunities.” When it comes to job security, this has been a tough year for tech workers. Amazon recently announced 14,000 layoffs, Accenture and Synopsis have announced thousands of layoffs, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle have made similarly dour announcements, and Intel has promised to reduce its workforce by a whopping 25,000. There are many other tech companies that have made similar moves over the last twelve months. Yes, lots and lots of people are getting fired right now, and, according to reports, it’s increasingly difficult for entry-level workers to find positions. Some people blame AI (which is promising to help America’s C-suite gut certain segments of their corporate workforce) while others merely blame our shitty economy, which seems to be suffering under the yoke of the Trump administration’s dopy fiscal policies. There’s no reason why both can’t be to blame. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Silicon Valley is in its downsizing era, and it’s not so much fun.

Title: Google offers voluntary buyouts to UK employees

Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is offering voluntary buyouts for employees in its UK offices, Business Insider has learned. An email went out to UK staff this week offering them a voluntary exit package, according to two people familiar with the matter and confirmed by a Google spokesperson. It's unclear which UK organizations the offers went to, or how many buyouts were offered. Google did not respond when asked for comment about this. "Earlier this year, some of our US teams introduced a voluntary exit programme with severance for U.S.-based Googlers, and we are now also offering the programme in the UK to support our important work ahead," the Google spokesperson said. "We are committed to investment in the UK and continue to hire for critical roles and important projects aligned with our company priorities to ensure we can deliver on the opportunity that AI offers the UK economy," they added. The voluntary buyouts are the latest example of Big Tech firms finding ways to reduce head count this year to become more efficient, flatten management structures, and lean into AI. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, while Microsoft has also offered some employees money to leave. The exact package being offered by Google in the UK would depend on how long the employee had worked at the company, staff were told. Google employs more than 7,000 people in the UK, according to its own figures. Google has offered voluntary buyouts across various parts of its US business this year, including its Android and Core engineering orgs. Much of the framing of these has been about how Google is reorienting its company around AI, and that it wants employees who aren't excited about that goal to feel like they can leave. In October, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan offered employees a voluntary exit package as part of a reorganization around AI priorities, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. "It's an incredibly exciting time at YouTube and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead. But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan wrote. Have something to share?

Title: U.S. stocks rise on a wave of fresh optimism led by Nvidia and Walmart

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time What began as a banner day for stocks turned into a major rout, as investors signaled ongoing skepticism about the longevity of the artificial intelligence boom and trimmed hopes of support from the Federal Reserve. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, and the broad S&P 500 index dropped by more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 top-tier stocks, declined by nearly 390 points. It had been up 700 points earlier in the day. Cryptocurrencies also shed billions in value: Bitcoin had fallen below $87,000 as of late Thursday afternoon, weeks after having set highs above $120,000. The stunning turnaround added further unease to an already shaky economy that has forced households to trim budgets amid stubborn inflation and signs of a wavering job market. With an ever-increasing part of the economy's principal driver — consumer spending — now reliant on affluent households, an extended market pullback could inflict wider damage. "You don’t have to have the biggest bubble in history for an expensive stock market" and end up seeing declines, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak asset management group. Traders’ hopes were boosted early Thursday by a better-than-expected jobs report that appeared to show the economy remained resilient. Even before the day began, stocks looked poised to rise after Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Yet by midday, markets had turned red. The solid September jobs report diminished the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month to lower the cost of borrowing money to spur economic activity. When investors don't have to pay as much in interest, they often put those savings into stocks. “The broad rebound in payrolls suggests diminished risks of a higher unemployment rate,” analysts with Morgan Stanley said in a note published shortly before noon. “We no longer expect a Fed cut in December.” Losses were further compounded by ongoing concerns about AI — specifically, how much more profitable the companies buying chips like Nvidia's will be. The fears were articulated Wednesday evening on X by Michael Burry, made famous by the movie "The Big Short." "Just because something is used does not mean it is profitable," he wrote. Finally, the ongoing sell-off of bitcoin indicated to some traders that a key source of support for stocks — retail or day traders — were beginning to waver on their trademark "buy the dip" mentality. "I wouldn’t say we’ve flipped from bull to bear," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group. "I would say we’ve flipped from bull to balanced market in the short term. A lot depends on whether sentiment continues to weaken." Stocks had already been showing signs of flagging in recent weeks. With Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest point since September. The long-delayed September jobs report, which showed that the United States added a sturdy 119,000 jobs, appeared to show some glimmers of hope for the economy. Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% in August to 4.4%, about 450,000 workers entered the labor force. Economists view that as evidence that job opportunities are still plentiful, despite a wave of corporate layoffs. Just before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report, Verizon told employees it planned to lay off 13,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce. The company joined a suite of other blue-chip employers that say they plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, including Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS. The details of the jobs report, which captured conditions before the government shutdown, as well more recent jobs data, suggested a more mixed picture for the U.S. economy. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. Wage growth slowed, and job totals for July and August were revised downward. The employment gains in September were concentrated in the health care, hospitality and social assistance sectors. Another snapshot of the economy came courtesy of Walmart, which on Thursday reported strong sales and raised its outlook for the year. That strength points to cracks in the economy, though. Executives said the chain is luring more high-income shoppers who are looking for bargains, and noted that lower-income families are feeling more pressure. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on an earnings call Thursday morning. Walmart's stock closed 6.5% higher. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

UPDATE: Verizon is set to lay off over 13,000 workers in the coming weeks as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring initiative. "Today, we will begin reducing our workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce our outsourced and other outside labor expenses," newly appointed CEO Dan Schulman writes in a memo to employees that it also published online. "Every part of the company will experience some level of change." Verizon had just over 100,000 employees as of Sept. 30, meaning the layoff will reduce the headcount by 13%. Schulman says that the company's current costs and structure limit its ability to invest in its "customer value proposition." He also argues that complexity and friction within the organization were slowing it down and frustrating customers. In the last quarter alone, the company lost 7,000 postpaid customers, while rivals T-Mobile and AT&T made significant gains. Verizon says it set up a $20 million fund focused on "skill development, digital training, and job placement" for the people it's laying off. It touted the fact that it's "the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI," which is...an interesting way to spin things. Those impacted in the US will be notified today, while those in other regions will be notified in the coming weeks, The Wall Street Journal reports. Original Story (11/14): Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. UPDATE: Verizon is set to lay off over 13,000 workers in the coming weeks as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring initiative. "Today, we will begin reducing our workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce our outsourced and other outside labor expenses," newly appointed CEO Dan Schulman writes in a memo to employees that it also published online. "Every part of the company will experience some level of change." Verizon had just over 100,000 employees as of Sept. 30, meaning the layoff will reduce the headcount by 13%. Schulman says that the company's current costs and structure limit its ability to invest in its "customer value proposition." He also argues that complexity and friction within the organization were slowing it down and frustrating customers. In the last quarter alone, the company lost 7,000 postpaid customers, while rivals T-Mobile and AT&T made significant gains. Verizon says it set up a $20 million fund focused on "skill development, digital training, and job placement" for the people it's laying off. It touted the fact that it's "the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI," which is...an interesting way to spin things. Those impacted in the US will be notified today, while those in other regions will be notified in the coming weeks, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Title: US filings for jobless benefits remained in historically healthy range during government shutdown

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer New U.S. jobless claim applications fell last week, remaining within the healthy range of recent years, according to the government’s first weekly layoffs data since before the government shut down on Oct. 1. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 fell by 8,000 from the previous week to 220,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Data for the weeks covering the government shutdown also remained in the same range of recent years, falling between 200,000 and 250,000. Also Thursday, the Labor Department said in a separate report that U.S. employers added a surprisingly solid 119,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest since October 2021, however that’s partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market. The increase in September payrolls was more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. But Labor Department revisions shaved 33,000 jobs off July and August payrolls. The monthly jobs report — considered the most important market-moving data on the U.S. employment situation — had been delayed for seven weeks by the federal government shutdown. During the 43-day shutdown, investors, businesses, policymakers and the Federal Reserve were without much of the figures they use to diagnose the health of the American job market because federal workers had been furloughed and couldn’t collect the data. Thursday’s labor market reports come at a time of considerable uncertainty about the economy. The job market has been strained by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump’s erratic tariff policies, though economic growth at midyear was resilient. Fed policymakers are divided over whether to cut interest rates for the third time this year when they meet in December for the final time this year. Some major companies have announced job cuts this year, including Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta. Intel and The Walt Disney Co. also recently announced staff reductions, as have Verizon, General Motors,American Airlines and Amazon. Thursday’s report on weekly layoffs showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,000 to 224,250. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 8 jumped to 1.97 million, an increase of 28,000 from the previous week.

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Verizon is laying off more than 13,000 employees in mass job reductions that arrive as the telecommunications giant says it must “reorient” its entire company. The job cuts began on Thursday, per to a staff memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman. In the letter, which was seen by The Associated Press, Schulman said Verizon’s current cost structure “limits” the company’s ability to invest — pointing particularly to customer experiences. “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” Schulman wrote. He added that the company needed to simplify its operations “to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.” Verizon had nearly 100,000 full-time employees as of the end of last year, according to securities filings. A spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs announced Thursday account for about 20% of the company’s management workforce, which isn’t unionized. Verizon has faced rising competition in both the wireless phone and home internet space — particularly from AT&T, T-Mobile and other big market players. New leadership at the company has stressed the need to right the company’s direction. Schulman became CEO just last month. In the company’s most recent earnings, he stated that Verizon’s trajectory was at a “critical inflection point” — and said, rather than incremental changes, Verizon would “aggressively transform” its operations. For its third quarter of 2025, Verizon posted earnings of $4.95 billion and $33.82 billion in revenue. The carrier reported continued subscriber growth for its prepaid wireless services, but it lost a net 7,000 postpaid connections. News of coming layoffs at Verizon was reported last week by The Wall Street Journal. The outlet says that the 13,000 job cuts mark the largest-ever round of layoffs at the company. Beyond the cuts across Verizon’s workforce, Schulman said that the New York company would also “significantly reduce” its outsourced and other outside labor expenses. It’s a tough time for the job market overall — and Verizon isn’t the only company to announce sizeable workforce reductions recently. More and more layoffs have piled up at companies like Amazon, UPS, Nestlé and more. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Regardless, such cuts have raised worker anxieties across sectors. Schulman on Thursday recognized that “changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries.” He said that Verizon had established a $20 million “Reskilling and Career Transition Fund” for workers departing the company. Shares of Verizon fell just over 1% by Thursday’s close.

Title: Creator Economy Ad Spend Projected To Hit $37B This Year, IAB Report Says
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/iab-2025-creator-economy-ad-spend-report-1236623395/

By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor The creator economy ad market will hit $37B this year, growing at four times the rate of the overall media industry, according to a new report on the sector. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s 2025 Creator Economy Ad Spend & Strategy Report forecast the massive growth in the sector in the U.S. this year, up 26% year-over-year. The figures point to marketers and advertisers increasingly treat contenting creators as distinct channels, rather than elements of social media campaigns, the IAB report claimed. Related Stories News Digital Talent Rep Fixated Hires Content Chief To Fill "Massive Hole" In Creator Economy News YouTube Diehard Trevor Noah Envisions A "Creator-Run World" Where Talent, Brands And Audiences Connect In "Beautiful Verticals" Spend included in IAB’s report includes direct partnerships and their paid amplification, along with ‘content adjacencies,’ defined as brands investing “intentionally run ads adjacent to creators with whom they do not have a direct partnership.” For context on the 2025 figure, media as a sector overall grew 5.7%, per a separate IAB study from September. Further to that, you can see the rate of growth in that IAB noted the overall creator economy ad spend for 2021 was $13.9B, rising to $29.5B last year. IAB projects the 2026 figure will be $43.9B, up another 18%. Watch on Deadline “Leveraging the creator economy to connect with audiences is no longer experimental for marketers – it’s essential,” said David Cohen, CEO at the IAB. “The significant growth we’re seeing reflects a deepening commitment from brands to invest in creator-driven strategies. However, with that maturity comes a need for clear standards, better measurement, and tools to navigate an incredibly fragmented ecosystem.” The IAB itself has had to pivot due to the tilt toward creators. The organization puts on the annual NewFronts in New York, a series of showcases to ad buyers dominated by streaming. As traditional NewFronts companies like YouTube, Amazon, NBCUniversal and Hulu have fallen out or shifted toward the traditional broadcast and streaming upfronts in mid-May, the IAB has branched out to gaming and creator events. Breaking the 2025 stats down, the most ad spend came from retail ($12.3B), followed by consumer packaged goods, finance, apparel, tech, auto, telecoms, travel, home, health and wellness, and media and entertainment the only vertical below $1B at $400M. IAB’s report showed marketers were most keen to pact with content creators who were managed by social media platforms such as YouTube BrandConnect and TikTok Creator Marketplace, followed by creators managed by media companies such as web publishers and TV networks and then direct outreach. Creator-specific representation agencies, which have been springing up at a significant rate, was the sixth-most popular route. Working with talent agencies such as UTA and WME and sports rep agencies, including the sports units of the Big Three, were least favored. It’s also expected AI will take a central role in creator-led campaigns with 46% of respondents currently using it for content creation and work processes and another 29% planing to do so in the next year. The stats come as TV and film companies continue to wrestle with their relationship with the creator economy. With thousands out of work following huge layoffs at media and tech giants over recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of content creators and more professionals exploring how they can apply their expertise to the creator world. IAB’s U.S. Creator Economy reaches its stats through an ad spend projection that measures the ad dollars brands invest in creators through direct partnerships. Earlier this week, credit card provider Visa released a report projecting the creator economy would hit $500B by 2027. Dade Hayes contributed to this report.

Title: Flipkart fintech super.money preps buy-now-pay-later play

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans. The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development. “Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout." The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface. Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category. This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised about $125 million this year, and Axio, acquired by Amazon for around $200 million, are already significant players in this space. According to Brijesh Damodaran, managing partner at Auxano Capital, a BNPL offering allows a UPI app to move beyond being just another payments button at checkout granting it greater control over the merchant interface with features such as EMI options, offers, and seamless pay-later flows. “UPI has won on volume but not on margins. But it carries zero MDR (merchant discount rate) and is heavily commoditised. BNPL or checkout credit lets a UPI app move from pure payments to credit-led revenue through interest, fees, or merchant commission," he said. MDR is the fee merchants pay to payment processors for accepting digital payments; UPI transactions have had a zero MDR regime since 2020, meaning payment apps earn no direct revenue from flows. Within the broader consumer credit landscape, BNPL is expected to grow at a robust clip of 20–35% annually over the next several years, though the big question is whether large banks, traditional card issuers, or UPI-first players like super.money will end up controlling most of the market at checkout, Damodaran added. Business basicsA spokesperson for super.money declined to comment on the new BNPL plans. However, founder Prakash Sikaria told Mint that the app had processed “around ₹740 crore of loans" last month alone through its various credit products. Apart from loans, super.money also works with a clutch of banks, including Axis Bank (for a co-branded credit card and secured cards), Utkarsh Small Finance Bank (secured credit cards and fixed deposits) and Kotak811 (secured cards and an integrated savings–spending–borrowing account). “Next year, our projection is 2 million cards. We are already among the top three issuers of RuPay cards and we want to be the largest," Sikaria said. Flipkart launched super.money beta version in June 2024 and rolled it out publicly in August that year. Since then, the app has doubled down on young, often first-time borrowers as its core market. To acquire these users, super.money leaned on a rewards-led model that offers up to 5% cashback on every UPI transaction. The strategy appears to have paid off: by September 2025, the app had climbed into the top bracket of UPI players by transaction volume, overtaking established names such as CRED, Amazon Pay, WhatsApp Pay and BHIM. Also Read | Can PhysicsWallah’s blockbuster debut revive India’s edtech dream? In September, super.money processed 256.34 million UPI transactions worth ₹9,852.44 crore, even as PhonePe and Google Pay continued to command 80–83% of the overall market, down from about 85% a year earlier. On whether such heavy cashback-led acquisition is sustainable, Sikaria said the average annual cashback per user is roughly $2–3. “Our thesis is we just need to monetize $2–3 more per user than our competition," he said. “India has a wide diversity of users; typically, monetisable users subsidise non-monetisable ones. If you can largely avoid non-monetizable users and focus on a high-Arpu (average revenue per user) segment, your average Arpu is much higher." Elaborating on secured credit products, Sikaria said that super.money sees average monthly spends of about ₹5,000–6,000 per secured card user, largely led by merchant payments. The app now has roughly 10.0–10.5 million monthly transacting users. On the revenue side, Sikaria said super.money is making about $3 million a month, which works out to an annualized revenue run rate of around $36 million at present. Flipkart’s renewed fintech bet with super.money marks its second coming in payments and lending after its PhonePe chapter. The e-commerce major bought PhonePe in 2016, but the two separated ownership in December 2022, paving the way for both to raise capital and scale on their own, with Walmart continuing as the common majority shareholder. Since then, PhonePe, led by Sameer Nigam, has filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for an initial public offering of around ₹11,000 crore and seen large secondary share sales, including General Atlantic’s $600-million deal that helped employees cover tax outgo on exercised stock options. Regulatory lensThe BNPL segment has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in recent years, especially around low-ticket unsecured lending, deferred payment products routed via prepaid instruments, and opaque pricing for borrowers. The RBI has tightened norms on digital lending and pushed lenders to hold more capital against unsecured retail portfolios. In 2023, the RBI also tightened rules around first-loss default guarantees (FLDGs), a popular comfort structure used by fintechs with their NBFC partners, where the fintech promises to cover part of the lender’s credit losses. The central bank capped such guarantees at 5% of the outstanding loan pool, after earlier market practice in some unsecured digital lending segments had reportedly gone much higher. That pushed several lending service providers to pause or redesign short-duration, small-ticket credit products as their NBFC partners reworked risk, capital and economics under the new cap. The BNPL landscapeThe UPI and BNPL market has filled up with rivals such as Navi (founded by Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal), MobiKwik, Paytm, Amazon Pay and Google Pay. In BNPL specifically, super.money’s planned products would sit alongside Snapmint and Axio, as well as captive “pay later" offerings such as Amazon Pay Later and Flipkart Pay Later, plus horizontal BNPL specialists like Simpl and LazyPay (owned by PayU). Also Read | Why Manipal and upGrad want Byju’s—and what’s really at stake now The BNPL industry in India has witnessed turbulence over the last few years, especially after high-profile setbacks like the shuttering of ZestMoney. Once a poster child for digital lending, ZestMoney ceased operations in December 2023 amid mounting non-performing assets and regulatory pressure, before parts of its loan book and technology platform were sold to DMI Finance, an NBFC lender. Layoffs and restructuring followed, and similar pressures have also hit rivals. Simpl, another leading checkout credit provider, has reportedly trimmed its workforce in October this year and faced regulatory heat, including enforcement action from the Enforcement Directorate this year.

In BNPL specifically, super.money’s planned products would sit alongside Snapmint and Axio, as well as captive “pay later" offerings such as Amazon Pay Later and Flipkart Pay Later, plus horizontal BNPL specialists like Simpl and LazyPay (owned by PayU). The BNPL industry in India has witnessed turbulence over the last few years, especially after high-profile setbacks like the shuttering of ZestMoney. Once a poster child for digital lending, ZestMoney ceased operations in December 2023 amid mounting non-performing assets and regulatory pressure, before parts of its loan book and technology platform were sold to DMI Finance, an NBFC lender. Layoffs and restructuring followed, and similar pressures have also hit rivals.

Title: In the Wake of the U.S. November Elections and the Reopening of Government? Food Insecurity, Worsening Economic and Social Crisis

On November 4, the electorate in several United States municipalities and gubernatorial races delivered a resounding rebuke to the current trajectory of the MAGA Republicans who control both Houses of Congress and the White House. The elections came just over two weeks after the second “No Kings Day” around the U.S. which mobilized an estimated 7 million people. Therefore, on electoral and mass levels people are expressing their disagreement and anger with policy imperatives of the current administration. During the months of October and early November, the U.S. Senate could not agree on a national budget to keep the federal government functioning. The major issue stalling an agreement was the threat on the part of the administration and its allies in Congress to not provide adequate funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was passed during the tenure of former President Barack Obama. Although the ACA has never been a viable substitute for a genuine national insurance program which would guarantee healthcare to all persons living in the country, the dissolution of what is labelled pejoratively as “Obamacare” absent of an alternative would of course prove disastrous. These cuts in healthcare funding, which delayed the reopening of the federal government for 43 days, resulted in the refusal of the administration to provide billions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Agriculture Program (SNAP) benefits to tens of millions of people. It would take a federal court decision demanding that the Trump administration pay out benefits to families which rely on these programs for a bare minimum of food to compel partial payments. Some states in the U.S. recognizing the potential for severe malnourishment, did release emergency funds to stave off a major food deficit crisis. . . Yet the crises are by no means resolved. Although the Republicans in the Senate pledged to reopen a debate on the extension of existing ACA subsidies, there is no methodology for holding them accountable. If the costs of healthcare premiums for ACA recipients increase substantially, it could very well portend the demise of the program since those within low-and-moderate income households would not be able to afford enrollments in this program. In addition to threats to the existence of the ACA, there is currently a bill under consideration in Congress which would place two-year limits, with some exceptions, on Section 8 housing subsidies. If these plans are carried out it would result in homelessness for millions more in the U.S. Consequently, the suspension of SNAP benefits, the overpricing for healthcare coverage and the severe curtailment of housing subsidies would inevitably result in the premature deaths of millions in the U.S. One commentator over the conservative Fox News network said on air that people who have no homes to live in should be given lethal injections by the government. These developments had a profound impact on mass mobilizations against Trump as well as the outcomes of the November 4 elections. The emerging crises requires an independent strategy to build a sustainable resistance movement to not only stop the ongoing attacks from the White House and Congress, the struggle must move to enhance the social safety net and improve the overall economic conditions for the workers, farmers and youth inside the U.S. One of the most watched elections during early November was the mayoral race in New York City, the largest municipality in the country. Zohran Mamdani won the election as a stated democratic socialist committed to lowering the cost of housing, public transportation and childcare. Mamdani emphasized that the municipality was a “city of immigrants” and therefore should not cooperate with efforts by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents to hunt down and deport residents of New York. During the days leading up to the elections, ICE personnel attacked vendors on Canal Street in Manhattan who are there daily merely to make a living amid rising inflation. People in the neighborhood battled the federal agents demonstrating their opposition to the immigration policies of the White House. In other elections where Democratic candidates won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, undoubtedly were the voters’ response to the presence of ICE and the worsening economic situation facing working people. In California, a referendum to create five new Congressional districts was a direct response to the actions of the Texas state legislature to enhance the membership of the MAGA Republican representation in the House of Representatives. Los Angeles, the second largest municipality in the U.S., has been targeted by the Trump administration by deploying large units of ICE agents along with federalized National Guard troops and Marines. These efforts by Trump have not endeared people in California and other states to his domestic policies. In Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., the deployment of the National Guard was carried out absent any support for these actions by the people. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago have taken legal and political actions to prevent the sending of National Guard troops into the third-largest city in the country. On a daily basis people in Chicago and its suburbs have been challenging ICE in their raids on communities, workplaces and commercial businesses. Portland, Oregon, which is not a majority African American or Latin American municipality, has also been targeted in all likelihood for its progressive population which fought the deployment of federal agents during the George Floyd uprising of 2020. On a legal basis and through mass demonstrations, the people of Portland strongly objected to the sending of National Guard troops into the city. Although Trump declared that ICE, the Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) agents and the National Guard are being deployed to find, detain and deport migrants, in actuality his security personnel have stated that they are after “gangs” and drug traffickers. These agents are setting up checkpoints to monitor the populations as a whole. Despite the claim of economic prosperity over the last ten months, untold numbers of workers, farmers, agricultural employees, small and medium-sized businesses are suffering immensely due to the repressive apparatus of the state. Many people are afraid to go to work while others cannot patronize businesses due to cutbacks in services. Large transnational corporations are being impacted as well with layoffs in the auto industry, delivery services and hospitality sectors. Sonder corporation after ending its partnership with Marriot International, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Amazon, UPS, Verizon and others have announced the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees. These layoffs will compound the problem of joblessness brought about by the massive downsizing within the federal government since the Trump administration came to power. During the campaign for president in 2024, Trump claimed that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After 10 months, the war rages on with Russian Federation troops now surrounding Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Sanctions against the Russian Federation and continuing weapons supplies from the U.S., UK and the European Union (EU) have failed to turn the tide of the war. Many other false statements related to ending the war in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have further exposed the ineffectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. The forced migration to at least five African states continues to prompt protests and legal actions in the U.S. and in at least one country on the continent. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is threatened with wider military assaults. Dozens have been executed extrajudicially by the Pentagon under the guise of fighting illegal drug smuggling into the U.S. In response, the government of President Nicholas Maduro has mobilized over 5 million people to resist any attempted land invasion. In Palestine people are still being killed, displaced, denied food and medical services weeks after a ceasefire was declared. Trump’s meeting with the Saudi monarchy will not benefit the workers and oppressed peoples in the U.S. and West Asia. These domestic and foreign initiatives by the U.S. administration are not reflective of growing strength among the imperialist states. It is a clear signal of a political quagmire and economic decline of Washington, Wall Street and its allies around the world. Therefore, the resistance movement to the Trump administration must seek allies broadly inside the U.S. as well as internationally. This global alliance of progressive and revolutionary forces provides the only method for the reversal of the present period of reaction. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Walmart raises sales outlook, boosted by e-commerce and higher-income shoppers

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Shoppers are still flocking to Walmart. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook Thursday, heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Walmart also offered fresh signs that it is shedding its original identity as a strictly down-market brick-and-mortar operation by growing its e-commerce business and increasing its market share of higher-income shoppers. Walmart's shares closed more than 6% higher Thursday, even as the broader market suffered a dramatic sell-off. The stock is up more than 18% this year. The biggest retailer and grocer in the United States acknowledged the added financial pressures on lower-income households but said middle-income families are holding up. Walmart saw more sales growth in its grocery and health and wellness product categories than in general merchandise. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on a call with analysts Thursday morning. The company reported that same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the quarter that ended Oct. 31, exceeding analysts’ expectations. “The team delivered another strong quarter across the business. eCommerce was a bright spot again this quarter. We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart reported 27% growth in e-commerce sales globally. Walmart also announced that it will move from trading on the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq next month. It’s the latest sign of America's largest private employer working to position itself as tech-forward in order to compete with Amazon. The discounter's third-quarter earnings come amid growing questions about whether Americans contending with tariffs, corporate layoffs and accelerating inflation are still confidently spending on retail. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence, Walmart’s strong earnings and guidance indicate that consumers are still shopping — at least at the lower end of the retail price point. The company announced last week that McMillon will step down in January. McMillon, 59, started at Walmart as an associate in the 1980s and has helmed the company since 2014. Under his leadership, Walmart improved pay and benefits for many employees, renovated hundreds of stores and boosted its e-commerce and delivery programs, especially during the Covid pandemic. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job Feb. 1. Since 2019, Furner has led Walmart's American operations — by far the largest slice of the company, with around 1.6 million of Walmart's approximately 2.1 million total associates worldwide. Walmart is leading the retail race against longtime rival Target, which Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter sales and cut its full-year profit guidance. Target’s sales have faltered over the last few years, with some consumers expressing frustration over what they said were disorganized stores and rollbacks of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In October, Target said it would cut about 1,800 corporate jobs. Target is hoping for a fresh start in the new year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke will take over Feb. 1, the same day Furner becomes CEO of Walmart. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it plans to increase its investment in stores and technology next year by 25%. Since January, U.S. businesses have had to contend with ever-changing tariffs under the Trump administration. Walmart has navigated the uncertainty by raising prices on some items, while swallowing some tariff costs on others. In the three months that ended Oct. 31, prices at Walmart U.S. rose around 1% overall, with higher prices on electronics, toys and seasonal items in particular due to tariff pressures. In the grocery section, Walmart expects egg prices to drop but anticipates the record-breaking beef prices will stay high, in part from cattle herds shrinking over the last few decades. Prices for other grocery staples are also up, though the Trump administration's rollback of tariffs on many food items last week could offer some relief. Despite the rising prices, Walmart is offering its annual Thanksgiving menu deal for 10 at less than $4 per person. It's less expensive than last year's package, but it also contains fewer items. The company is also expanding its use of artificial intelligence, teaming up with OpenAI to allow customers to buy from Walmart within ChatGPT. Walmart has not detailed the terms of the partnership or shared when the new option could be available. This week, Target announced its own collaboration with OpenAI. Walmart has lagged behind rival Amazon in AI-driven e-commerce — Amazon debuted its Rufus shopping assistant in February 2024, more than a year before Walmart launched its counterpart, Sparky.

Title: Long-delayed jobs report to show hiring amid wobbly economy
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/long-delayed-jobs-report-show-hiring-amid-wobbly/story?id=127668400

The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as "stagflation." Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. “We have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. "A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it," Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: September jobs report arrives today, almost seven weeks behind schedule

Scott Horsley Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An overdue report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%. The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December. While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall. The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months. Loading... For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling. "Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode," Waller told a group of economists in London this week. Business leaders, he said, are "starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future." Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers. Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But minutes from the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers. Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year. Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting. But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. "You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door," Waller said. "And then these firms are not going to be hiring." While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios. The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs. The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring. Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come. "There's definitely a reduction of supply," he said. "But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The September jobs report is finally here

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The United States added 119,000 jobs in September, a stronger-than-expected figure and a sign that the economy was adding jobs at a healthy clip before government shutdown. But the details of the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a more mixed picture, that of a labor market that has recently begun to look wobblier amid high-profile layoff announcements from a host of blue-chip companies. September's employment gains were concentrated in health care, food and drinking establishments, and social assistance. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, though the pickup was due in part to an increase in the labor force, which the BLS said gained 450,000 new potential workers. The pace of wage growth slowed. Thursday’s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the BLS said Wednesday. The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market. But data from private and alternative sources has painted a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and stubborn price increases. Over the past few weeks, Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS have announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Their ranks were joined Thursday by Verizon, which announced the start of layoffs affecting 13,000, according to an internal memo. About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve — a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis. A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions. Whatever the exact total, those who do find themselves without work are now experiencing an average unemployment spell of 24.5 weeks — nearly six months. That’s the worst reading since November 2017. Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring. And what companies are still hiring are offering lower compensation rates that more experienced workers may have trouble accepting. The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said. Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a “post and pray” job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach. A bright spot has been local government, Price said — something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in. “It’s a weird market,” she said. Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration. “My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,” he said. In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable. The Fed’s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. “Most participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further” interest-rate cuts “could add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,” the notes said. So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires. “Fears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Pop In 2025 or 2026? How About Nvidia and OpenAI?

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

This season, retailers and shoppers alike are contending with a shorter holiday shopping window — on top of tariffs, waning consumer sentiment and recession fears. The 2025 holiday shopping season is shorter than usual, with 28 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That’s one extra day compared to last year’s ultra-condensed shopping season, but four fewer shopping days than 2023. Cyber Monday will fall in December this year, and Christmas will be on a Thursday. By some metrics, the holiday shopping season is shaping up to be merry and bright. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising as much as 4.2% over last year. Similarly, EMarketer is forecasting holiday sales of $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year over year. But the holiday season is unfolding against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. U.S. employment is worsening with the highest level of October layoffs in 22 years last month, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Retail was one of the most heavily impacted industries, Modern Retail previously reported. Tariffs and inflation have also negatively colored consumer sentiment heading into retail’s biggest sales season. Consumer sentiment has fallen about 6% in November so far, according to the most recent survey from the University of Michigan. All told, this year’s condensed shopping calendar is landing at a difficult moment for the industry. Retailers are already juggling tariff-related cost pressures that have complicated everything from inventory planning to pricing strategy, and now they have fewer days to make up crucial fourth-quarter sales. Consumers, meanwhile, are heading into the season with shaky confidence, tighter budgets and heightened sensitivity to prices. Taken together, a shorter runway and a more cautious shopper are reshaping when — and how much — people are willing to spend, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already strained holiday period.“We’re going to see a lot of different headwinds this year, and this is one of them,” said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney, where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. Here’s a look at how retailers and consumers are preparing for a shorter holiday season complicated by President Donald Trump’s trade war, inflation and a worsening labor market. Over the past few years, retailers have pulled forward the timing of holiday deals, kicking off the season outside of tentpole occasions like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year was no exception, as Amazon effectively kicked off the holiday season with its earliest ever “Big Deals Prime Day” sale in October. The sale ran from Oct. 7 through Oct. 8, slightly earlier than last year’s event, when the sales ran from Oct. 8 until Oct. 9. Retailers including Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s introduced overlapping promotions to pull in early holiday demand ahead of the Black Friday peak. Some retailers introduced their holiday marketing campaigns well before Halloween. Macy’s, for instance, started its “100 Days to Christmas” campaign in September. Meanwhile, Nordstrom launched its holiday season campaign at the end of October. Walmart promoted its Thanksgiving meal basket in late October. That strategy may become even more important this year as retailers navigate fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, along with concerns about how tariffs and inflation may impact consumer spending. Kearney’s Black said that while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the season’s biggest tentpoles, this year’s economic backdrop is amplifying the need for strong early performance. “Cyber Monday and Black Friday have never been more important,” she said, adding that economic uncertainty and higher prices are motivating people to seek out promotions earlier in the season. According to Circana’s annual holiday outlook survey, 44% of U.S. consumers say they plan to begin their holiday shopping earlier than they normally would. That’s up four percentage points higher from Circana’s survey last year. Nearly half of consumers plan to start shopping before Thanksgiving. Less than 20% will wait until December, which marks the lowest level of late-season holiday shoppers since 2021, according to the survey. Black said the shorter holiday shopping calendar may also hinder impulse purchases. “You may be a little less likely to pick up the ‘Oh, I need to get another gift’ thing. … So, it can absolutely have an impact,” she said. A shorter shopping window means operational precision matters more. Retailers have only a few weeks to move inventory and meet tighter shipping deadlines. Black said the fundamentals will be critical: “They need to have fast shipping. It needs to be easy for [the] consumer. They need to have great in-stocks, and the experience really matters.” That pressure is pushing retailers to diversify last-mile options. Kevin Sides, CEO at logistics provider ShipMonk, said shifting volume to regional carriers has become one of the biggest logistics trends across his client base heading into the peak holiday season. Indeed, regional carriers like Jitsu, SpeedX and Veho ramped up their service coverage in the U.S. earlier this year, per Supply Chain Dive. “It’s not just FedEx and UPS getting orders out and delivered anymore. These regionals have way more of a market share,” Sides said, citing alternative parcel carriers like OnTrac and UniUni. “If 50% of your volume [is] not going with a regional, you’re leaving a lot on the table from both cost and performance.” More specialty retailers inked partnerships with delivery startups in 2025, rather than building out their own fulfillment networks, to better compete with behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Old Navy and DoorDash, for instance, launched a nationwide partnership for same-day delivery of clothing and holiday items, making it one of the first major apparel retailers on the platform. Ace Hardware also inked a deal with DoorDash earlier this year, offering on-demand delivery from local hardware stores. Despite the compressed calendar, Sides said consumers shouldn’t expect widespread delivery disruptions, as long as they avoid last-minute ordering and pay attention to shipping deadlines. “There’s not a carrier that’s not [delivering] packages in time for the holidays when you’re shipping by the third [of December],” he said. “But consumers shouldn’t wait too much to the last minute.” As the season wears on and shipping cutoffs tighten, more shoppers may turn to stores. Bain & Company’s holiday forecast predicts that 36% of U.S. consumers will shop entirely or mostly in physical stores, up from 24% in 2024. Large retailers with expansive store networks can also lean more heavily on same-day and buy-online, pick-up in-store options. Brad Jashinsky, director analyst at Gartner. said these capabilities will become more important as shipping cutoffs approach. As he put it, “That’s where the advantage of Amazon, Walmart, Target and others [comes in], where they can utilize their very sophisticated supply chains or … in-store” fulfillment. As generative AI reshapes search, marketers debate the value of committing (or overcommitting) to an AI SEO strategy. Data center demand is projected to grow 33% annually by 2030, while the industry struggles to find qualified candidates for increasingly complex systems. The proposed ban on THC-infused products was included in the bill Congress passed to end the government shutdown.
