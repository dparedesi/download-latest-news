Everytime you receive news that your job is on the line or you’re forced to leave your role due to ... [+] remote work policies, use it as an opportunity to try something new and reinvent yourself "We're moving in a new direction." "We're undergoing a restructure." "This is our year of efficiency." "We're headed in a different place right now." "The company is undergoing downsizing to reduce waste." How many times have you received a notice or email that included any of these lines? The anxiety creeps and your heart starts pounding because you already know what follows...you're fired. Or at least, you're on the chopping block and can expect your role to be eliminated at any moment. We've barely completed the first quarter of 2025, and already the workplace is experiencing major upheavals. BP is cutting 5% of its workforce as part of its "simplify and focus" plan, and joins companies like Meta and Bridgewater Associates, who announced plans to cut 5% and 7% of their headcount respectively. And to add to 2025's unfolding workplace drama, newly appointed President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday forcing all federal workers to cease working remotely, or they will be fired, with some exemptions being permissible. This news comes on the heels of Amazon's five-days-a-week RTO policy implementation as of January 1, according to Business Insider. Trump's executive order could potentially impact 1.1 million federal employees who are eligible to work remotely (out of the 2.28 million government workers)—228,000 of them who are already fully remote, based on figures from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s report to Congress in August 2024. The goal? To ultimately shrink the federal workforce in line with the goals of the newly-created government thinktank and temporary Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE, which is focused on slashing costs and expenditure of resources across government agencies by 2026. In fact, tech mogul Elon Musk who heads the operation, stated in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed alongside Vivek Ramaswamy that "requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," referring to the loophole in statutory civil-service protections that allows “reductions in force” that don’t target specific employees. "If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home," he said. The intent behind forcing eligible federal workers and current fully-remote government employees to work remotely five days a week comes as no surprise. Other major companies such as Amazon have been suspected of quiet firing in an effort to drive efficiency (quiet firing is the practice of creating hostile, demotivating, or other negative conditions at work that create a condition where employees voluntarily hand in their resignations, which reduces the need to go through the process and consultations associated with firing). A recent ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 U.S. managers found that "45% of companies anticipate layoffs in 2025, with many citing economic concerns, AI automation, and the incoming Trump administration’s policies as influencing factors." Additionally, a recent Pew Research Center survey noted that nearly half (46%) of remote workers say they would readily leave their job if no longer permitted to work from home. Although of course, labor unions and others are using their rights to sue and push back against anti-remote work policies such as those advocated and enforced by Trump and his allies, the fact remains that incidents like these create hostility towards professionals who already work from home, and a culture of remote work being taboo. If you're a federal employee (or work at a company that's in the process of enforcing RTO mandates) and you work from home in a hybrid arrangement, or are 100% remote, here are a few steps you should take now so you can continue to work remotely and feel supported in your goals: Whenever quiet firing occurs, prioritize taking care of your mental health First, it's OK to feel enraged, slighted, and hurt after providing years of service to the same employer and consistently being a high performer, especially if you're a public servant. It's natural to feel shock and anxiety during moments like these. This is why it's critical now, more than ever before, to take care of your mental wellbeing and take time to breathe, and acknowledge and express your feelings. Find or create a support network. Take up a new hobby. Throw yourself into something healthy that will distract you from your current employment situation. Understand that it's fine to not have everything together in your life, and what you're feeling is likely what thousands of other workers are feeling right now. Whenever you hear about a "restructuring" or "flattening structures" within the workforce of your company, consider it a time for change—not just for them, but for you. If they can head in a new direction, so can you. It's time to shift your perspective and, although it's easier said than done, view it positively, because this is your chance to rediscover yourself. After all, you are the architect of your future. No one, not even an employer that you've held a decades-long commitment to, has the right or power to control your life and whether or not you achieve your career and financial goals. Sometimes, major negative events occur in our lives so that we can rethink the meaning of our existence. It gives us time to pause and reflect about whether we want to continue working in the same role, or whether it's time to try something new. Your challenge is to use this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and try something new. Take time for your hobbies and try online personality tests and quizzes to understand your core values and passions. This can help you shift your focus from seeing your current employment situation as a negative thing, to actually viewing it as a catalyst for positive change in your life. This is because often, you won't progress in your career and fulfil your potential until you're uncomfortable with your work environment. Discomfort creates change. Next, it's time to dust off your resume and LinkedIn profile and update them. In fact, go ahead and give them a total overhaul. If you're serious about finding remote work, you need to be proactive about displaying the right skills in your resume—especially skills that are in high demand for most remote jobs, like roles in marketing, project management, and AI. Although you can use traditional sites like Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter to find remote jobs, it's much easier to locate them through job boards that specialize in remote and flexible work such as FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, and Remote.co. Additionally, the start-up incubator Y Combinator has a job board on its website that is constantly being updated for remote jobs at start-ups. And of course, don't forget to reach out to your network and strategically build new connections. Freelancing is a viable and increasingly popular alternative to traditional employment. There are expected to be more than 86 million freelancers (half the U.S. workforce) by 2027, so why not use your skills to join them and make money? As a freelancer, you have more control over your hours and location of employment, so this is highly favorable for remote work, and you can start building your freelance business immediately. The success of your freelance business is in proportion to your expertise, marketing, and research, and will grow as fast as the hours and effort you put in. Freelancing is one of the easiest ways to find a remote job straight away Remote work and hybrid working isn't over in 2025. By following the advice in this article, you can continue to prioritize your wellbeing, spend time with loved ones, make more money, and cut the headache and costs of commuting as you embrace this new way to work.

Your one-stop shop for data visualizations that explain complicated and cool stuff in digestible ways. top spots The tech industry has seen some brutal layoffs in recent years — but, if employee reviews are anything to go by, Big Tech companies are at least keeping their existing workers happy. To uncover the best states and cities for Big Tech employees, Switch On Business analyzed Glassdoor employee reviews for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta published between January 2023 and October 2024, then ranked companies' locations by average employee rating. The best city for Apple workers was Palo Alto, California, where employee ratings average at 4.48 out of five. The biggest disparity between the highest- and lowest-rated cities belonged to Amazon. The company's employees gave Herndon, Virginia, an average rating of 4.24, compared to just 2.73 in Buena Park, California. There wasn't a single US location where Google or Microsoft employees rated their experience below 4.0, on average. Meta's best state for workers was Florida (4.29), while the worst-rated was California (3.90). When it comes to the lowest-rated places for tech workers, company headquarters were often among the spots with the poorest employee reviews. Click images to enlarge Via Switch On Business.

Title: Global Supply Chains See Nearly 40% Annual Increase in Disruptions

January 21, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Resilinc Resilinc MILPITAS, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resilinc, the leading provider of supply chain resiliency solutions, is sharing exclusive new data revealing the top drivers of supply chain disruptions for 2024. The data compiled by Resilinc’s EventWatchAI, a 24/7 risk monitoring database, reveals that overall disruptions to global supply chains increased 38% from the previous year. The top five disruptions for 2024 include: Factory fires maintained their position as the number one disruption for the sixth consecutive year, with 2,299 disruption alerts issued. Fortunately, this number is down 20% from the previous year and has declined 36% from the record high in 2022. Labor disruptions made it into the top five list for the second year in a row, jumping up to the second spot with a 47% year-over-year increase. Labor issues played a major role in impacting most industries in the U.S. and globally, including company and site-level strikes, national strikes, labor protests, and layoffs. From the ILA U.S. port strike, impacting over 47,000 workers, and the Canadian rail strike to major layoffs at tech giants Intel, Dell, and Amazon, labor disruptions continued its streak as a key risk area for 2024. Financial risk areas, including business sales, leadership transitions, and mergers and acquisitions, rounded out the top five disruptions for 2024. While business sales climbed a steady 17% YoY, leadership transitions surged 95% last year. Several notable transitions included leadership changes at Boeing, Nestlé, Pfizer Limited, and Intel. While mergers and acquisitions saw a slight decline of 5%, they remained a top disruption for 2024. Though the number of disruption alerts increased overall, several risk areas experienced substantial year-over-year increases; for example, extreme weather jumped a dramatic 119%. Consistent with this trend, flood-related alerts surged by 214%, forest fires increased by 88%, and hurricanes/typhoons jumped by 101%, underscoring the growing impact of extreme weather risks. Other noteworthy trends highlighted in the data include a 146% rise in labor violations such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and health and safety violations, among others. Geopolitical risk alerts climbed 123% after a brief dip in 2023, and protests/riots saw an astounding 285% YoY increase, marking the largest growth increase of all risk events tracked by Resilinc. Regulatory change alerts, which include tariffs, changes in laws, environmental regulations, and bans, continued their upward trend with a 128% YoY increase. The five most disrupted industries included Life Sciences, Healthcare, General Manufacturing, High Tech, and Automotive, marking the fourth year in a row that these particular industries have been the most impacted. Of all the 22,522 EventWatchAI notifications sent, more than half (59%) were impactful enough to trigger the creation of a WarRoom—virtual platforms in the Resilinc dashboard where customers and their suppliers communicate and collaborate to assess and resolve disruptions—emphasizing that disruptions not only increased in 2024 but also had a heightened impact on global supply chains. Resilinc’s data is gathered by its 24/7 global event monitoring Artificial Intelligence, EventWatch AI, which collects information and monitors news on 400 different types of disruptions across 104 million sources including traditional news sources, social media platforms, wire services, videos, and government reports.

Title: Indie Agencies Seek a Competitive Edge as Talent Rejects WPP Office Mandate
URL: https://www.adweek.com/agencies/indie-agencies-seek-a-competitive-edge-as-talent-rejects-wpp-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2025-01-21T11:00:00Z

The stage is set! Advertisers, don't miss this cultural moment. ADWEEK House The Big Game is headed to New Orleans on February 7. RSVP. WPP made a bold move last week as the first major company in the ad industry to mandate that its 100,000-plus employees around the globe must return to the office four days per week. Five years on from the pandemic, there are legitimate reasons to return. Following in the footsteps of other major corporations, from Amazon to Toyota, WPP executives are eager to increase productivity, strengthen culture, and utilize dormant office space. But the decision has gotten under the skin of many employees who thrive working remotely or in a hybrid role, who have caregiving responsibilities at home—or who simply don’t appreciate being told where to work. A petition started by WPP employees on Change.org pushing back on the mandate has garnered more than 16,000 signatures so far. WPP is not the only holding company to enforce a return to office. Publicis employees were told to return three days per week, and dozens were laid off late last year for violating the policy. But none have pushed the mandate beyond three days in-person. That’s in contrast to big clients including JPMorgan Chase, Google, IBM, Apple, and Uber, which have ordered workers back to the office full time, with some threatening job cuts for non-compliance. Undoubtedly, the aggressive mandate will push some WPP staffers to seek job alternatives that are more flexible—and agencies who promote those policies may reap the rewards. “A-plus talent has choice,” Jared Belsky, CEO of independent media agency Acadia, told ADWEEK. “They want to work where they feel empowered and trusted. It’s hard to say ‘we trust you’ and then say ‘we are checking your badges to make sure you are here four times per week.’” Scott Brandon, CEO at agency Brandon, said that WPP’s policy reflects an old-school approach in an industry that thrives on evolution. “Rigid mandates risk alienating top performers who know their best work isn’t tied to a cubicle,” he said. “The backlash here isn’t surprising—people are looking for agencies that prioritize results and culture over arbitrary rules.” Jeff Levick, CEO of We Are Rosie, a fully remote company which offers brands flexible agency staffing, added that most return to office policies come from the CFO to justify expenses—but that creatives often work best with flexibility. Kandi Gongora, chief transformation and people officer at Goodway Group, added that office mandates will also limit holding companies from being able to hire the best talent across the country. “This ultimately leads to unsatisfied, unproductive employees in search of greater autonomy and far less access to incredible talent that exists outside of geographical barriers,” she said. While there are viable reasons for people to be in the office, agencies should prioritize those most impactful moments for people to come in, whether that’s to meet with clients, brainstorm with their teams, pitch new business, or build camaraderie, said Andrew Graff, CEO of independent agency Allen & Gerritson (A&G). Mandates must also be thought through carefully, particularly for agencies that downsized office space during the pandemic. WPP staffers are already grumbling about where they will work, as available desks and meeting rooms may be at a minimum, according The Drum. These are all kinks WPP will have to work out as it works through the logistics of an office return. Sasha Martens, founder of Sasha the Mensch, an international headhunting firm, believes independents stand to benefit most from WPP’s mandate, as staffers worry other holding companies will follow suit. “You’re more likely going to see some of the bigger companies say four days a week as well. What that does is open the door for more flexible and independent companies,” Martens told ADWEEK. With Omnicom’s takeover of IPG also spooking talent in fear of layoffs and priority changes, independent agencies could have an advantage. Indeed, Belsky said Acadia has “already seen resumes starting to trickle in, and I would predict we see more.” Levick agrees that flexible businesses like its own will benefit, as We Are Rosie has seen an uptick in resumes in response to return-to-office mandates in the past. “We’re entering this new marketplace where people can decide how they want to work, and if they want to go to the office,” he said. Agencies say a return to office will foster the creative alchemy that happens when teams work together in person. But those who are flexible can still come together with intention , without telling employees what to do. A&G redesigned its offices in Boston and Philadelphia with an eye on flexibility and community for that reason, inviting community members to share the space with it. “Your first space is your home. Your second space is the office. And the third space are those places where you gather and be social but still may conduct business,” said CEO Andrew Graff. “For an industry that is about creativity, I would think we could be a little bit more creative on how we think about these policies or mandates.” Agencies are businesses, and real estate is a substantial investment that they must justify. But disengaged talent can be just as costly in terms of lost innovation, diminished morale, and turnover. “The future of our industry isn’t about going back to the way things were—it’s about finding sustainable solutions that support strong outcomes and a workplace that works for everyone, wherever they are,” said Brooks Luquire, CEO at agency Luquire. Though “human interactions breed creativity,” according to Devin Reiter, president at agency Fortnight Collective, and most agencies are looking for some level of return, flexibility is now a big differentiator. “What the industry needs is balance,” said John Geletka, CXO and founder of Gelekta+. “People need to work together, and work hard, but then need the room after long nights of work to get some home-time and take care of their lives.” Study: Ad Agencies’ Return-to-Office Mandates Pose Hiring and Retention Challenges Kyle O’Brien is a staff reporter for Adweek and editor of AgencySpy.

Title: Can The Washington Post save itself?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Staffers plead with Jeff Bezos amidst a talent exodus The Washington Post is one of the most storied organizations in American journalism. But it is in crisis, losing reporting talent, suffering a loss of readers and facing a staff rebellion against publisher Will Lewis. The Post has been swamped by "one debacle after another," since Lewis took charge of the newspaper a year ago, said NPR. The decision by the owner (and billionaire Amazon founder) Jeff Bezos to cancel the Post's traditional presidential endorsement in an apparent effort to placate newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump was a huge blow, causing "hundreds of thousands of subscribers" to cancel their subscriptions. Layoffs have led to fewer journalists on the job, contributing to plummeting morale that led some of the survivors to flee for jobs elsewhere. A "clear vision" to put the Post back on track to journalistic and financial success remains "elusive," said NPR. More than 400 Post staffers last week sent a letter to Bezos asking him to "get personally involved to turn the paper back in the right direction," said Poynter. The staffers said in the letter they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions" that caused readers to bolt. They asked for a face-to-face meeting with Bezos in the service of "restoring trust that has been lost." Bezos did not immediately reply. Escape your echo chamber.

Bezos has "plunged my beloved Washington Post into darkness," said Eleanor Clift at The Daily Beast. Post reporters have done a "first-rate job covering Trump," but Bezos' decision to pacify the incoming president (with the non-endorsement, as well Amazon's $40 million expense on a documentary about Melania Trump) has raised the specter their journalism could be "compromised by anything that could damage Bezos' financial interests." Bezos' decision to get on Trump's good side "has ramifications far beyond the Post newsroom." If the Post is to remain viable, it must "retain, not lose, its talent," Margaret Sullivan said at The Guardian. It's not "unreasonable to question" whether the Post can maintain its independence in the Trump era, and "Bezos may not care." But if he does care, he should "show up — soon" in the newsroom to talk to reporters, and recommit to the "importance of editorial freedom." He should also dump Lewis, who has overseen a rapid decline in the Post's standing. For the sake of both journalism and "democracy itself, I sure hope he finds a way to do it." On the eve of Trump's inauguration, the Post unveiled a new mission statement: "Riveting Storytelling for All of America." The slogan is intended as an "internal rallying point for employees," said The New York Times. And the paper's chief strategy officer has announced a goal of reaching 200 million paying users. That's an audacious target: The Post currently has fewer than 3 million digital subscribers.

Title: Content Americas 2025: The Confab’s No. 1 Question, a Movie Renaissance, What Buyers Want, Brazil and Deals to Date
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/content-americas-key-themes-and-major-takeaways-1236279425/

By John Hopewell Chief International Correspondent MIAMI — The best thing about the Miami Hilton Downtown is its vistas from above Biscayne Bay and opposite the city’s iconic serried strip of high-rises. Delegates at Content Americas, which begins its third edition this Monday, will be hoping that the market will afford an equally panoramic view of the international TV business. That’s crucial. Few areas of the world became so dependent on global platform investment as Latin America during the pandemic. Bucking worldwide trends, series season orders actually soared in Spain over 2024, shooting up from 43 a year earlier to 75, according to Ampere Analysis. “Content Americas is the first TV event of the year and, therefore, an opportunity to test, by talking to folks, your incoming hypotheses about how market trends will play out,” says Gaumont USA’s Christian Gabela. Related Stories VIP+ A Decade of Data Supports Sports’ Domination of Broadcast TV 'Prime Target' Trailer: Leo Woodall and Quintessa Swindell Uncover Conspiracy (TV News Roundup) As of Sunday, participation sits at just short of 2,000 delegates and 175 exhibitors, edging up from compared to 2024. Popular on Variety That slight increase reflects the fact that, when it comes to Latin America, most all players have attended from last, with Content Americas serving as both a market and production meet, connecting major players from Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic and Spain. Some urgent, specific questions need answering. One case in point: After across-the-board top exec layoffs and departures, effective from December, how will Televisa-Univisión streaming service ViX handle acquisitions? The big question delegates hope Content Americas will address echoes across the world: After a severe corrective in 2023, will global TV streamers in any way be back in the saddle driving growth in Latin America? Don’t Expect Easy Answers Content Americas attendees shouldn’t expect easy answers. “Global streamers are still in different phases — some are consolidating, some are driving toward profitability, and some are business as usual. It’s hard to know what the next year will look like. This unpredictability represents a challenging time for producers,” says Erik Barmack at L.A.-based Wild Sheep Content. Sales cycles have slowed dramatically after the launch of original production across the region, from Netflix’s “Club of Crows” in 2015 to Paramount+ and HBO Max service bows in 2021. 2024: As Bad As It Gets? There is a dire need for visibility, however. Some stats set to be fired off at Content Americas will make for startling viewing. In 2022, major global streamers – Netflix, Amazon, Apple, WBD, Disney, Comcast and Paramount – made 69 season orders in Brazil. By 2024, that figure was down to 28. Mexico’s 49 commissions in 2022 plunged 27% to 36 in 2024. Given global streamers have been the fundamental industry driver of recent years – and lifeboat in 2020 – their corrective plays out over the whole industry. One-year results, however, can be hugely misleading. In some countries, such as Brazil with Globo, incumbents are still highly important. One bottom line is that buoyed by ad tiers, SVOD players will continue to grow their subscription bases in Latin America, Netflix from 51 million in 2024 to 69.5 million in 2029, Omdia predicts. Some established players, such as NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, look bullish on production growth. Its chairman, Luis Fernández, will deliver one of the most awaited keynotes at this year’s Content Americas. “At a time when Telemundo is the most-watched network in prime time, we are super-charging our scripted content production under one strong brand: Telemundo Studios,” Fernández told Variety last April. A Stabler Market The bottom line, per industry consensus, however, is that far fewer originals will be produced in Latin America in the future compared to the explosion of orders in the recent past. Producers hope, at least, that the market will settle. “2024 was clearly a year where streamers’ budgets for “originals” became increasingly under pressure,” says Gabela. “Our hope is that there’s greater stability in that regard in 2025.” Ringing the Changes “Stabler” is another way of suggesting that, of course, money will be tight throughout the industry. So the story of 2025’s Content Americas may well be producers’ and distributors’ reactions to that. “Independents need to be creative now about financing plans that incorporate multiple territories, to be clever about understanding public funds and the general ecosystems in particular markets,” says Barmack. There are some more obvious ways forward that are already on the radar. “Last year, as streamers cut back on commissioning projects, co-production and windowing became the talk of the town. In 2025, I think we’ll see more of those conversations materialize into deals as the industry readjusts,” says Gabela. “Fewer originals means the need for more co-productions and invites us to be creative to find the financing,” agrees EO Media’s Eze Olzanski. Movies: A TV Industry Future At least in the English-speaking world, there’s a kind of rebound in films from A24, Blumhouse, and Neon with “Longlegs” and “Terrifier,” for example, auteur genre films with talent cast against type. “[Creative] talent can make the difference and become a part of the business equation, and the payoff can be really, really high,” says Fremantle’s Manuel Martí. Gaumont USA, with Pasajero, has produced Netflix’s “The Biggest Fan” with Kate del Castillo as it sets up remakes of its classic film catalog at platforms. The Mediapro Studio has scored one of its most significant hits in 2024 with “El 47,” the frontrunner at February’s Spanish Academy Goya Awards. “I think the sector’s going back in some ways to what it was before,” Olzanski tells Variety, noting that global streamer production is ever more ‘local for local,’ though local may be one territory and fewer projects will be for all Latin America or aim for global.” Selectivity Volume for volume’s sake is a waning philosophy: “Independents need to be pickier, frankly, about projects. Not all of this pullback is bad — it’s forcing higher standards that the industry could use,” Barmack observes. Olzanski agrees. “The industry is finding its new balance, understanding its current size, how much it can produce and sell, and working for that size. It’s a moment of honesty for the industry.” “Reducing the number of productions and releases, particularly releases, might seem a bad thing, but on the positive side, gives more visibility and value to launches,” he adds. What Will Buyers Be Buying? There was a time – broadly last decade – when experiments ran wild at pay-TV operators and an early Netflix. From the turn of this decade broadly, a pivot occurred: “Creators are working with known genres and frameworks and then trying to reinvent them,” Berlinale Series head Julia Fidel noted in 2022. Now, “series are genre layering, layering one genre on top of another,” said Fremantle’s Manuel Marti. One part political exposé, another part espionage thriller, “Yosi, The Regretful Spy,” whose Season 2 competes for a Rose d’Or Latino, is one case in point. Another contender, the Natalia Beristáin showrun “Midnight Family,” from Fremantle and Fabula, melds a reality-sourced medical thriller and family drama. Series, Martí points out, will remain plot-driven, “making you want to see the whole season,” and character-driven, “making you come again for the second season.” Character-driven drama is, moreover, on the rise. “I guess at the Emmys, both ‘Shogun’ and ‘The Bear’ were character-driven, which is what people especially crave,” Martí observes. More Buyer Interests Beyond that, “Regular, returnable and franchiseable content will be the most attractive,” says Ampere’s Fred Black. “Particularly crime dramas, which work globally and are produced internationally.” On distribution, apart from the more relevant new launches, buyers are moving ever more into non-exclusive deals, says Olzanski. On the local side, “we’ve gone back to a more normal thing with the usual slots for television: Action, natural disasters, a family, kids, co-viewing, and so on,” he adds. The production of fewer originals doesn’t mean that streamers will be acquiring more, he cautioned, “and that is part of finding the new balance.” Brazil “Thanks to the global presence of the streamers, Brazilian producers’ content has been watched outside the country, which was great for them, and now they want more. Being in such a huge market, having success abroad is a newly acquired desire, not necessarily a need,” says Martí. Also, he notes that global streamers look set to be obliged to invest a percentage of gross revenues in Brazilian content. Content Americas 2025 takes place, also, as “I’m Still Here” scored a best actress award for Fernanda Torres and “Senna,” praised for its production values, has played in Netflix’s global Top 10 non-English TV charts. It’s a special moment for the international industry to see Brazil as a key production center,” says Luis Toledo, the former highly active Spcine exec, who is launching Filomena Productions to connect Brazil, Latin America and the global South with established international markets. “This is exactly the reason for creating Filomena. To “prove” or guarantee to the more developed film markets that the global South can deliver the same quality but with lower prices and also new stories/narratives. The world can’t stand watching ‘Fast and Furious’ number 156 anymore.” Deals to Date *El Estudio, partnering with L.A.-based Happy Accidents, has acquired adaptation rights to ”Here Come the Habibs,” a fish-out-of-water Australian comedy about a Lebanese family. The adaptation will be set in Mexico City. *Pablo and Juan de Dios Larraín’s Fabula and BBC Studios-backed Spanish shingle Brutal Media are set to co-produce “Los crímenes del Glaciar,” a Patagonia-set triller adapting Cristian Perfumo’s novel. Rights were licensed from Scenic Rights. *Luiz Toledo, the formerly highly active director of investments and strategic partnerships at Spcine, the São Paulo Film Commission, has launched Filomena Productions, a private sector consultancy that aims to help supply missing links between burgeoning audiovisual hubs in Brazil, Latin America, and the global South and established international markets. *Murilo Benício, star of smash-hit Globo telenovelas such as “The Clone,” “América” and “Brazil Avenue,” and Kevin Vechiatto, who grew up in Brazil’s biggest kids franchise “Turma da Mônica,” are set to headline “Nico,” a smart comedy from LB Entertainment, behind “Netflix” global No. 1 Non-English TV series “Sintonia.” *Banijay Rights’ Content Americas lineup is headed by doc series “Bosé Renacido,” the most-watched non-fiction format in the history of Spain’s Movistar Plus+ platform. Title is produced by Shine Iberia, part of Banijay Iberia. *EO Media-sold ‘Sumergidos’ will make its Latin America pay TV Debut on A&E Jan. 27. The 13-part crime thriller had its local debut on Paramount Channel in Brazil and on Argentina’s TV Publica in 2022. *SkyShowtime has announced that production is underway for “Nails,” its third original series commissioned in Spain. A comedy about four women seeking to escape societal pressures, “Nails” is produced by Federation Spain in collaboration with Telemundo Studios and SkyShowtime.

Title: Unannounced Warhammer RPG cancelled towards end of last year - report

As Games Workshop seeks next success. An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year. A report by MP1st details posts by former employees of a developer known as Thought Pennies - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles. As with many other companies over the years, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO Daniel Erickson posted: "Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding." This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled. One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'. Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game. This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week. In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.

Title: How a 'low performer' label makes things worse for laid-off workers
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/low-performer-label-meta-microsoft-layoffs-impact-recruiters-experts-2025-1

Targeting "low performers" might seem like a logical tactic for big companies looking to streamline their workforces. But when Meta and Microsoft recently announced performance-based cuts, it sparked a debate online about the potential impacts of publicly labeling someone a "low performer" — a term loaded with negative connotations. Layoffs can already be traumatic for workers, and experts say such tags only compound the issue, creating new obstacles for those back on the job hunt. "Here's the real deal — a 'low performer' at Meta could be a rockstar anywhere else," Jan Tegze, a Czech Republic-based tech recruiter, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. But now, these "people have to job hunt with this label hanging over them. Every recruiter, every hiring manager will see these headlines." Jennifer Dulski, the founder and CEO of Rising Team and a management lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, said on LinkedIn that it was "reasonable to let people go for lower performance than others on the team, and to share that reasoning with them." "However, publicly branding employees as low performers serves no one — not the individuals, not the remaining team, and not the company's reputation," she added. "That will stick with and damage many people's careers. It's unnecessary and punitive," Jonathan Shottan, chief product and content officer at Tonal, said. Previous research has suggested that finding a job may be more difficult for laid-off workers due to the stigma they may encounter among potential employers. And with job seekers also facing a slowing job market and new hurdles such as the ever-expanding rollout of AI in workplaces, the added "low performer" tag may make the job search even trickier. Others have defended Meta and Microsoft's announcements, however. "Who would you fire? Your top performers?" One LinkedIn user wrote in response to Tegze's post. "There isn't a company in the world who would let go of anyone that they didn't think was their lowest performers." "What if.... they 'are' actually low performers," another said. "Stop jumping on the let's bash Zuk bandwagon." In an internal memo seen by Business Insider earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees that he had "decided to raise the bar on performance management" and act quickly to "move out low-performers." The cuts will affect 5% of the company's workforce, equivalent to about 3,600 roles. Microsoft has not announced the number of employees it plans to let go. For those who do find themselves caught in the layoffs, experts have some tips to help ensure they give themselves the best chance of getting back to work. Writing on X, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president, advised those hit by cuts targeting low performers to carefully and openly explain their situation to hiring managers. Evans said it can be natural for recruiters to wonder if an interviewee has performance problems that they should avoid and that "your ability to respond calmly and confidently will matter just as much as the actual content of your answer." "If your entire team or division was cut, this is the strongest story. Be clear about that and say, 'My entire team was cut.' Point them to a news story that verifies your claim if you can," he said. He added: "Never badmouth your old boss or company." "Just like dating, no one wants to start a relationship with someone who isn't over their ex." Business Insider contacted Meta and Microsoft for comment. Jump to
