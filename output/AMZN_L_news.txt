Two US senators have questions for Big Tech and other top companies over their use of H-1B visas amid the Trump administration's push to slow down foreign worker hiring practices. In letters sent to 10 companies on Wednesday, including Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said they were concerned about the use of H-1B visa workers while the tech sector experiences a "high unemployment rate." The senators cited the layoffs the companies conducted in recent years and the number of H-1B visas they applied for in 2025. In the letter addressed to Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, the senators wrote that Amazon had laid off "tens of thousands of employees in recent years" while it was approved to hire "at least 10,033 H-1B employees" in the latest fiscal year. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the letter said. Each letter contains eight questions regarding the company's foreign hiring practices, including whether a company has "displaced any American employees with H-1B employees." The letters were sent to Amazon, Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Walmart. Spokespeople for these companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The probe comes just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that implements a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B application. The initial unveiling of the H-1B overhaul sent companies scrambling to notify their foreign employees to get back to the US in under 24 hours. The White House later clarified that it was for new visas. Some business leaders, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, hailed the move as a necessary corrective to the existing process, while others said it could hurt smaller companies that can't afford $100,000 application fees. A JPMorgan Chase report published Tuesday said that the new fee could reduce the US work authorizations by 5,500 per month. Jump to

Title: Some Clues That a Recession Is Coming

Cardboard-box demand can be a legitimate indicator. Hemline length? Not so much. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Alan Greenspan knows a thing or two about underpants. American history’s second-longest-tenured Fed chairman also knows a thing or many about recessions, obviously, and the two are related: Sales of men’s underwear, Greenspan once reportedly suggested, are inversely proportional to economic anxiety. As the theory goes, men see underwear as a luxury, not a necessity. When money gets tight, boxers get holey. According to folk wisdom, when a recession is imminent, sales of snacks, cigarettes, champagne, and cardboard boxes also go down. Demand for lipstick, laxatives, instant noodles, used clothing, high heels, scary movies, and mini liquor bottles, meanwhile, goes up. Hemlines drop; law-school applications rise. Baby butts get rashy. Halloween gets less spooky. People gravitate toward public libraries and private labels. They spend less at restaurants. They stop dyeing their hair and dry-cleaning their clothes and going to the strip club, and they definitely do not buy an RV. Well, supposedly. If you ask an economist, they will almost certainly tell you that a recession is indicated by things such as mounting unemployment, falling industrial production, and short-term interest rates rising relative to long-term ones. If you ask the people working at National Bureau of Economic Research, who actually make the call about a recession, they will say it is a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” They are highly unlikely to tell you that the best way to understand the state of global markets is to take a look at your ankles. That’s not to say that pop-culture recession indicators are meaningless. A recession is a phenomenon necessarily defined in hindsight, usually long after life has changed on the ground: The Great Recession officially began at the end of 2007, but NBER didn’t announce that it had until the following December, right around when more than half a million people lost their jobs in a single month. Consumer behavior is a reactive measure of how much money people have in their pocket, which is probably why Greenspan was apparently paying attention to underwear. Many other pop-culture recession indicators—including the rise in law-school applications, the decline in demand for cardboard boxes, and the growing use of libraries and generic products—have been validated as useful signals about the health of the economy. They currently show what the more traditional indicators also show: The American economy is full of uncertainty, even though it has not yet tipped officially into recession. But taking anecdotal intuition about individual consumer psychology and extrapolating widely can lead to some odd and unhelpful conclusions. The way people spend their money is personal, and the product of a complex set of factors. It’s also sometimes illogical. Case in point: In 2008, when the Nielsen Company did an analysis of consumer behavior during a recession, the firm’s findings indicated that whereas candy is recession-proof, soda—liquid candy—is among the most recession-prone consumer goods. And societies don’t respond to crises the same way every time. The hemline index, which holds that in bad times hemlines go down and in good times they rise, is one of the most cited pop-culture recession indicators. It originated in the 1920s, when most women didn’t work outside the home, style (and society) were far more rigid, the fashion industry operated completely differently, and the miniskirt did not exist. Even if it were possible to reliably measure hemlines on a large scale, they are also influenced, in the short and long term, by trends, weather, and norms. Economic anxiety is a powerful force, but it is not the only force dictating the way people act. Here is what we know, according to Joanne Hsu, who runs the University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment survey program. Generally speaking, the less money people feel like they have, the more likely they are to skip big expenses and to substitute cheaper, lower-quality goods where they can. (Indeed, sales of Hamburger Helper are up 14.5 percent this year, as sales of most luxury goods are down.) They seek out stress relief, good deals, and cheap indulgence. They also apparently seek out economic folk wisdom. This may not be a recession, but it is definitely a boom time for talking about being in a recession. According to various reports, people are, at this moment, listening to “recession pop,” going “recession blonde,” and getting “recession nails.” Online, the recession indicator has quickly gone from pop-economic trivium to absurdist meme. Among the supposed signs of our impending economic catastrophe that whizzed past me this spring and summer like the world’s most depressing rewrite of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”: Labubus, urban lumberjacks, messy buns, capri pants, hot women in eviction court, Hot Pockets changing its packaging, the Coachella lineup dropping early, the resurgence of frozen yogurt, a new Air Bud sequel, an American pope. Some of these are legible enough; many are ridiculous. (Recession indicator is this season’s Sir, this is a Wendy’s, the blank form through which anyone can launder a basic observation into something that sort of resembles a joke, especially if you’re not paying very close attention.) None of these meme indicators have, to my knowledge, been formally validated by the academic establishment. But I find it very telling that young people on the internet are casually invoking an arcane economic concept in order to explain the way their world feels. Maybe the ultimate recession indicator is how much people are talking about recession indicators. Not that I blame them. “Recession indicators” are appealing like the 10-day weather forecast is appealing. We turn to them not because they are accurate, but because they offer the illusion of control. Everyone gets rained on in a monsoon, but it’s still nice to know to pack an umbrella. These little predictors make the abstract feel concrete and the future feel foreseeable, maybe even manageable. They reduce the economy—sprawling, complex, scary-big—down to something as small as a tube of lipstick. And maybe most important, they’re a quasi-academic way of corroborating your own reality—a vibe check, a pat on the shoulder, a Ph.D. for your dread. Starting in 2022, as inflation surged post-lockdowns, economists have been predicting a recession. Thus far, one hasn’t officially arrived. But try saying that to people paying $8 for eggs. “People don’t feel like they’re thriving as they should be, as they might expect to,” Hsu told me. “So I think it makes sense that people are looking for things that validate their experiences.” Of all the unorthodox recession indicators, cardboard-box production is one of the most reliable, because cardboard boxes are a very straightforward proxy for the quantity of goods being shipped around the world. The outlook isn’t good: On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that box shipments are at their lowest levels since 2016. All across the economy, people are buying less and doing less. They’re forgoing the things they really want because they cannot afford them, because they don’t have enough money. At a certain point, that’s indicator enough.

World WASHINGTON: US lawmakers asked major companies including Apple, Amazon and JPMorgan on Thursday (Sep 25) to explain why they continue to hire thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while laying off American staff. The letter follows the Trump administration’s plan to impose a new US$100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas and rework the program to favor higher-paid and higher-skilled applicants. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin wrote to 10 major employers demanding details on the number of foreign workers they employ, their wages and whether US workers have been displaced. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The Wall Street Journal first reported the letter. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and other firms investing heavily in artificial intelligence have all announced layoffs this year. Yet they remain among the largest users of the H-1B program, which allows businesses to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. Amazon and its cloud unit AWS received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas in the first half of 2025, while Microsoft and Meta had more than 5,000 approvals each, according to government data. India accounted for 71 per cent of approved H-1B beneficiaries last year, with China second at 11.7 per cent. Deloitte, Alphabet’s Google, Walmart, Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services were also among the recipients of the lawmakers’ letter. Microsoft declined to comment, while Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Cognizant did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

September 25, 2025 23 min read Computer Punch Cards, Coding Pipeline Problems, and the Future of Women in AI Carla Brodley, founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University, explains how to make computer science education more accessible to everyone By Katie Hafner, Laura Isensee & The Lost Women of Science Initiative Lily Whear (composite) In high school, Carla Brodley was almost shut out of computer science when boys took over all the computers. But she rediscovered her love for the field in college and has made it her mission to open doors for others. She became founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing, which now partners with more than 100 institutions to make computer science more accessible, at Northeastern University, where she also served as dean of Northeastern’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences from 2014 to 2921. As a result of Brodley’s work, including her push to introduce more flexible degree programs, more women—and especially, more women of color—have not only enrolled but also stayed in the field. Now, with support from Pivotal, a group of organizations founded by Melinda French Gates, Brodley is aiming to scale up her efforts. Today she joins Lost Women of Science host Katie Hafner to share her journey, new paths to computer science and the way artificial intelligence fits in.

TRANSCRIPT Carla Brodley: It turns out that because of the way our systems have worked in this country, that the people most often who've not had access to computer science in high school are the people that would, if we could make it so that they enjoyed and persisted in computer science would change the demographics. Katie Hafner: I am Katie Hafner, and welcome to the latest episode of Lost Women of Science Conversations where we talk with authors, artists, and others who've discovered and celebrated female scientists in books, poetry, film, and the visual arts. Today I'm joined by Carla Brodley. She's a computer scientist and the founding Executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University in Boston. Carla has led the center to impressive success, not only to draw more women and women of color into the study of computer science, but to retain them. The center partners with more than a hundred universities and institutions across the United States. And at those partner institutions, the number of women and people of color studying computer science who complete their degrees has increased dramatically. Today we're going to learn what's behind this success, what's next for inclusive computing and why it's all very personal for Carla Brodley. Carla, thank you so much for joining me today. Actually, in person at WBUR in Boston, one of my favorite radio stations that I grew up with, I hasten to add. Carla Brodley: I'm delighted to be here, Katie, and to talk about a subject that I love. Katie Hafner: I have to say, Carla and I go pretty much way back. We've been talking about this intractable, uh, I don't know if you'd agree with me that it's still an intractable problem of women in computing for a while. I've been writing about it for a long time, actually, since my daughter was born 32 years ago. This problem of attracting women to, and mostly retaining them. Computing and I wanted to start out by asking you your story and how you became a computer scientist. Carla Brodley: I always loved as a kid playing with blocks and building things, and I think my parents thought I was gonna be an architect because I loved math and I loved making things with my hands. And I went to high school in Bloomington, Indiana and I took a computer science class 'cause my father suggested it. And I was in ninth grade and this was a huge high school, 2000 people. And I had gym right ahead of my computer science class and. The gym was about as far from the math department as you could possibly get in this large sprawling, you know, rural high school. And I would run and I would get to the class and both computers would already be taken and there were nine other students in the class, and they were all boys and perhaps they hadn't gone through puberty yet and understood the value of the nerd girl in their future, and they did not allow me to touch the computer. And so I talked to the teacher who was a math teacher and mostly just sat there and let us do what we wanted to do, and he said I needed to work it out with the kids. So I wrote my programs by hand and I debugged them by hand and it was fun, but it was fairly discouraging and I didn't go on. Katie Hafner: Just to be clear, you wrote them and debugged them by hand and you still got an A, right? Carla Brodley: Correct. I got an A. And at that point, frankly, computer programs were fairly simple and the ones that they would have you write in grade nine were very simple. So you could do that and. We moved to Boston when I was 16. I went to a wonderful, more liberal arts focused high school, and I've always loved to read. So when I headed to McGill University, I decided to major in English and my parents rolled their eyes and tried to suggest that I do math. Katie Hafner: What a reversal that you, it's not like you wanted to do something in science and they said, no, no, no. A girl doesn't belong in science. You headed to English. Right? And they said … Carla Brodley: And they just rolled their eyes and said, you're not very good at English, you're much better at math. What are you doing? And I was rebelling as 17 year olds do. And that comes to one of the principles that I've always said as part of the work that I do. Now, why do we let 17 year olds decide who goes into tech? A 17-year-old often is making decisions that are not the best for their future. So I got to McGill and I was in my English classes and I love to read, but I don't really like to write that much. And so I didn't do very well, so I thought, well, this isn't very practical. I think I'll be an econ major. And then my roommate, who was a metallurgical engineering student, came home one day and she threw this pack of cards down on the table and she looked at me and she goes, Ugh, you would like computer science? And I thought, huh. I don't know. Maybe I would Katie Hafner: You mean a pack of computer punch cards? Carla Brodley: Yes. Uhhuh. I am that old. And for those who are much younger, a little bit about punch cards. So back when your grandparents were, um, studying computer science, the way that, um, computers worked was you had these punch cards and each row, or each column, I've forgotten now, which it was, uh. You could punch out one little part of it and then that would be. Like a letter and you'd have a whole bunch of letters, and that would be a computer instruction on each card. And then you'd have a stack of these and you'd feed them through a card reader that would look for the holes, translate that into the electrical impulses of zeros and ones, which is the language that computer understands, and from that execute the code. Katie Hafner: So punched or not punched. Punched or not punched. Mm-hmm. Carla Brodley: Now interestingly enough, if you dropped those cards on the floor, you spent a long time reordering them. Katie Hafner: Uhhuh. I can imagine. Yeah. So imagine, Carla Brodley: You know, an analogy would be you've written a paper and you've got words, and then you accidentally drop them on the floor, all the words individually, and now you have to put them back into the sentences. Not fun to drop those cards. Katie Hafner: So your roommate, whose name was. Carla Brodley: Paula Magdi. Katie Hafner: So Paula, this metallurgical engineering student, she throws these computer cards on the kitchen table and says, okay, this is something you, Carla would like, and you then Carla Brodley: It was not a compliment. Let me just make that very clear. So I thought, huh, that's interesting. So I signed up to take Fortran programming. We were on terminals. Mm-hmm. So I didn't have to do the cards. I'm not sure I would've loved computer science, had I had to do the cards, but I was able to program. By the second program, I still remember the second program was Newton's method, which is a way of mathematically solving integration. I was hooked. I was like, this is so much fun. And by the end of the semester, and it was my second semester of my second year of university, I remember calling my mother and saying, I really think I should change my major to math and computer science. And my mother was like. Well, why do you think that? I'm like, it's so exciting. It's so fun. I can't wait to do the assignments. She says, it's a no brainer. You should do this. Oh, and so I did, and it was the best decision I ever made. Now I had straight A's in everything. Katie Hafner: Okay, so this is so great hearing your story. Clearly you were inspired to use that inspiration that you had to become an educator and build an education program and a curriculum that makes computer science more inclusive and supportive. Uh, so is that correct? Carla Brodley: It is correct. When I became Dean of Cory College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern, and now I had the ability to work with the university, work with the faculty to think about how do we make it such that everybody could discover, have a sense of belonging and persist in computer science. And in particular, I also wanted to think deeply about the problem of what if I hadn't discovered computer science? What if I'd graduated with that degree in economics? But then later I discovered computer science. And that was the birth of really thinking about the Master's in computer science for people who didn't study computer science as undergraduates. And the program had already had a nascent start at the university before I got there, and they were thinking about this program as a way for people to switch fields in STEM. When I took over, I changed it to be, you could be from any field, you could be a theater major, you could be a dance major, you could be a business major. And how would we prepare you to join the direct entry Master's students? Those that came with an undergraduate degree in computer science to thrive, persist, and graduate with a master's and go work in industry. Katie Hafner: And what year was this? Carla Brodley: This was in 2014. Katie Hafner: Oh, so relatively recently. Yeah. Carla Brodley: So we started small because I wanted to make sure that companies were gonna like this type of graduate Katie Hafner: Companies, meaning those who would be hiring. Carla Brodley: Yeah. And it turned out they were more popular with companies than the students who had done computer science throughout. Katie Hafner: This is reminding me so much of kids who major in something else and then go on to get a post back for going to medical school. My own daughter majored in religious studies and went on to go to medical school and they loved her application because she had this sort of very rich different background. Do you think that's part of it? Carla Brodley: Very much so. The industry loved the diversity of thought that came from these students. This program is called the Align Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I spoke to one of our biggest employers, which was Amazon and they told me that when you have an employee who maybe majored in English or history or something in the liberal arts and then gets a computer science degree, that their ability to think about the problems and their ability to talk about the problems is at a whole other level than someone who's just studied computer science. And then if you think about the students that maybe had an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry, and now they have a master's in computer science with a specialty in data science. You know, who does the biotech company or the pharmaceutical company wanna hire is the person who can understand both sides of what it is they're trying to do. Katie Hafner: The very human side, and I think this is actually a good time to interject with an experienceI had recently where I gave a commencement speech at San Francisco State University to the computer science department. And when I was preparing it, I had long conversations with the chair of the department who was so kind of down in the dumps about his graduates four years ago. They enter computer science with just such high hopes and enter AI into the equation. So now these kids are having trouble finding jobs because of AI. And I said to him, should I even mention AI in the speech? He said, better not. Carla Brodley: First of all, I think that it's not clear to me that AI is what's taking the jobs, even though that makes a fancy headline. I think that we're in an interesting time where there was a lot of hiring during COVID in tech because the whole world thought we were just gonna be all tech all the time. So, I think some of the layoffs that have happened are corrections of the over hiring. And second, I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the business world right now with high interest rates and an inability to know exactly what's gonna happen with the economy. And so companies are not hiring a lot. I think that there will still be jobs. I think we're in a somewhat unique place where AI is happening at the exact same time as all of these economic factors. Katie Hafner: Interesting. Carla Brodley: And I don't think we're gonna know for another year or two whether it's actually the business environment that we're in right now, and the uncertainty around the future of business and how we're gonna proceed as a country versus how AI is impacting the workforce. So I, I think that it's an interesting time, but I do think very much so that the student that is trained in computer science and another field is gonna be the most desirable on the market. Katie Hafner: So let's talk more about that training and how CIC is changing how students are learning computer science. What do you see as the biggest barrier? When you look at a traditional computer science degree program, Carla Brodley: The number one biggest barrier for a student who's new to computer science, and that is more often women or people from races and ethnicities that have been historically minoritized in tech and students of all genders, races, and ethnicities from high schools that don't have computer science. And only 56% of our schools nationwide in the United States offer computer science in high school. And it's often an elective. And my own sons told me, taking computer science in high school was social suicide. So the only way we're gonna change who goes into computer science in high school is if it's required for all students. Katie Hafner: That's a classic pipeline problem. Carla Brodley: That is a classic pipeline problem. So now fast forward and students are in university and maybe they're interested in computer science and they walk into the class and maybe they're part of the majority group, maybe they're not, in terms of demographics and there's people that are in that classroom that are talking about, you know what they got on the AP Computer Science. They're asking questions like, is that a Boolean? Is that an inherited class? And the student who's new to computer science is sitting there and saying, “a Boolena”, what’s an inherited who? And the analogy I like to use is, imagine you're 18, you've gone to university, and you decide to take Japanese or French or Spanish, and you walk into the classroom and you look different than everybody in the classroom, and everybody else is already talking in that language. Katie Hafner: So this seems to go straight to the heart of your philosophy, which is this idea that it's not the person who's the problem, that it's the curriculum that's too rigid. That, that whole idea of a flexible curriculum, is that right? Carla Brodley: It's the system. It's the way the institution has decided to offer computer science. There are several ways to take that feeling out of the classroom. One way is to just make multiple sections of your first class. Let's call that CS one and have students self-select whether they would like to be in a class with true beginners or in a class with more experienced students. And then the key is that they learn the same things. They have the same assignments and the same exams. All you've done is remove the stress of sitting in a room with a bunch of know-it-alls. And there's a few other solutions to this problem of having this distribution of prior experience with some people having quite a bit of experience and some people completely new to coding. We have about five different approaches for universities to take. And when we work with universities, we try to figure out what's gonna work for them in terms of the approaches. Katie Hafner: Yes, because every university has its own individual sort of set of problems Carla Brodley: And what language they use and how that impacts what the AP computer science test is in, and whether they have a lot of transfer students from community college. So every university context is really important, but the principle is the same: Don't lump them all together. Katie Hafner: Right. And don't just assume everybody does the same thing. I have actually watched you in action. I followed you once to one of these universities where you met with the computer science department and you're just so good at listening. You're almost like a therapist in a way. Let's talk about required classes. Just an example: calculus for a lot of students, myself included, that class can feel incredibly intimidating. It's like organic chemistry from pre-med. It isn't essential for every computer science career, but it is required to complete the degree, and in your research, it shows up as one of the biggest roadblocks as. Especially for women. Let's not forget, we're talking here about women and the retention of women. So why is that, and what do you think could make this hurdle a little less intimidating? Carla Brodley: Only 20% of high school graduates have taken calculus, which means that the majority of people heading to university have not taken calculus. They may not even be what's called calculus ready, which means they've taken pre-calc, and so that means that students come to university. With various levels of prior math exposure and the biggest mistake the computer science department can make, whether or not they require calculus, that's not the biggest mistake. The biggest mistake is tying progression in the computer science classes to progression in the math classes. Let me be more specific, requiring calc one before they can take the first computer science class or the second computer science class as a prerequisite. As a prerequisite, that's a mistake because it's not relevant to the first class and it's maybe not that much fun versus the first computer science class which is unbelievably fun if you're gonna like computer science, Katie Hafner: Right? Carla Brodley: Not all computer scientists like calculus. Katie Hafner: Right. Yeah, that's such a good point. Like it's, so there's this really special switch that gets switched on when you are turned on a computer science. I think that's absolutely right. More after the break. Katie Hafner: Okay, so here we are talking about curricula and formal teaching. Carla, I can't do this whole episode with you without asking you about figures in history. Uh, women in computer science, in the history of computer science. For instance, one of the women we featured was Klára Dán von Neumann who knew nothing about computing because it kind of didn't even really exist when her husband, John von Neumann, sort of taught her. She did some of the very first modern style code on a computer in the 1940s. But she'd never been able to do what she ended up doing if she'd gone through all that calculus rigamarole, or she never even learned any of that. And there's another figure in history who I just found out about named Sharla Perrine Boehm. So you can tell me, have you ever heard of Sharla? Carla Brodley: I don't think so. Katie Hafner: Thank you. That's my point exactly. It turns out that she was instrumental in developing packet switching, and her name is on some of the early packet switching papers. Uh, so, excuse me. Like it was somebody who brought her to our attention. And do you think that there are a lot of women out there like her, like Klára, who did important things in computing early on, who we still need to dig and find? I would imagine so Carla Brodley: Given that I didn't know who this person was. Katie Hafner: Right? And you look so sort of chagrined and contrite, like, I'm sorry, I don't know. But of course you shouldn't be chagrined and contrite because I didn't know, and I wrote a whole book about it. And I love discovering them; and talk about persevering. I mean, these women must have done something really, um, what's the word? Uh, unusual to achieve what they achieved. And I think that what you are doing with CIC is just smoothing the way. Would you agree with that? Carla Brodley: I think that I'm helping make sustainable systemic change in the institutions themselves so that the barriers that they've unwittingly and unknowingly constructed. So, not intentionally. I don't think so. In fact, when it's explained to them why having calc one as a prereq for the first computer science class as a mistake, they get it. They just hadn't thought about it. They did not do it on purpose. So an example of a barrier is you all can try CS one and CS two, the first two classes, and you should take calc one and calc two. And then depending on your GPA, you can get the golden ticket of being the computer science major. And that's biased toward people who've already had computer science in high school and who's already had computer science in high school Katie Hafner: Boys, Carla Brodley: Asian boys in particular. Katie Hafner: Oh, interesting. Yeah, of course. The very ninth graders who wouldn't, those ninth graders Carla Brodley: That wouldn't let me touch the computer. Katie Hafner: Uh, okay. So I hear you wanna make a sustainable, inclusive computer science program at institutions all over the country. What real world results have you seen so far? Carla Brodley: So there are 50 universities offering or about to offer the bridge to the Master's program for people who didn't study computer science. And so that means that those people will be new to computer science and they will come from all, you know, demographic identities, and that's really exciting. And at the undergraduate level, at the schools that we've worked with for long enough to be able to have measurable results, which are, uh, 21 of our 35 schools that we've worked deeply with at the undergraduate level, we have seen incredible increases in groups that have been historically underrepresented in tech and in particular, one of my favorite statistics is African American women from fall of 19 to fall of 2023, have gone up by 136% and yet wait 136. And you could say, well, that's because maybe the number was very small, but that's 455 net new Black women in computer science at these 21 universities. Katie Hafner: That's pretty incredible. Yeah. So hats off to you. So what are some other new initiatives that you're working on that you're excited about? Carla Brodley: I'm super excited about two new initiatives, and both of them are really designed to make people versatile in today's world. There are also ways to help students discover computer science because if I hadn't had that experience where my roommate insulted me into trying it, I would've never discovered it. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Paula. Thank you, Paula. And so I started thinking about this, and when I got to Northeastern there was this idea of a combined major. And when I looked at this, we had 12 of them when I joined as Dean in 2014. And they were all the things that computer scientists thought made sense. And I was like, such as? Physics and computer science, electrical engineering and computer science. Math and computer science. And then there was this one design and computer science in our college of arts, media and design. And I saw that all the demographic diversity was in that one, especially the gender diversity. And I thought about it and I'm like computer sciences for everyone and everything. And so during my time as Dean, I added 36 more, like English and computer science, cybersecurity, criminal justice, data science in every field of stem. And now, fast forward to today, these programs kept growing. We have 46 different interdisciplinary majors. Katie Hafner: Really Carla Brodley: Over 50% of our students are now pursuing these interdisciplinary degrees. They're very popular with industry. Again, these students get hired at the juncture of their fields or in one or the other of their two fields. I wanted to take this idea out to other universities to show that it could be done at large, complicated public universities of all sorts. So we created a portfolio of universities. We have eight of them in the portfolio. They're in different parts of the country. They're different types of universities. Some are top ranked universities in computer science, some are flagship, some are more open access, and we're working with them to do all of the work under the hood to enable these interdisciplinary majors. And we have several of these universities starting offering this fall and others are on track for next fall. And offering these interdisciplinary majors like computer science and neuroscience, um, psychology and computer science. Katie Hafner: That's fascinating. So tell me about the second initiative you're excited about. Carla Brodley: Well, I think it's on everybody's lips right now: AI Katie Hafner: uhhuh Carla Brodley: And thinking about how do we make sure that women are going into technical AI education, or all people are going into technical AI education. Some of the things we're thinking about are: can we create specialized math classes for AI that don't take the same amount of time as going through the topics sequentially in the math department. To really do machine learning, you need to have ideas from calc one, from calculus two, from linear algebra and probability and statistics. Katie Hafner: But not everything. Carla Brodley: But not everything. And not necessarily the way the math department would teach them with the proofs. We need to know how to apply them and to understand them in computer science. And so we're starting to think about an initiative where people create math for CS, math for AI classes as part of this initiative otherwise students can't take their first AI class until their fifth, sixth, or seventh semester in university, and that's too late. We're also thinking about how do you bring AI into the very first courses so people can see the applicability of machine learning algorithms perhaps in medicine. Or in science or in the digital humanities, Katie Hafner: And you just got a really wonderful, large investment. Tell us about that. Carla Brodley: We just received a wonderful gift to support our initiatives both around the systemic change in undergraduate programs and in particular around the systemic changes needed to be made in AI from Pivotal, which is Melinda French Gates's organization, where they've really, really invested in women in, in innovation and tech. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Melinda French Gates and Pivotal, for doing that. I mean, she has done tremendous work in helping women thrive in the workplace, right? Carla Brodley: She's one of my heroes. We have been very fortunate to get an investment substantial enough that we'll be able to move the needle in AI across many universities in this country. Katie Hafner: That is amazing. I don't wanna be a Debbie Downer here, but it does make me sad to think about other sources of funding that have been drying up. I don't think we can have this conversation without talking about that. So many of these publicly funded initiatives are suffering. What are your thoughts on not just that in general, but about the backlash against diversity and equity efforts? Carla Brodley: I think that it, there are many ways to achieve diversity and equity in terms of initiatives, and the CIC has always focused on fixing the system rather than doing things around individuals. And it turns out that when you fix the system, you often get the results that you're hoping for. We didn't do anything specific for black women and yet they went up by 136%. We just stopped doing things that don't work for true beginners. And true beginners can be white men as well. And so it benefits everybody. So there's things that we can be doing that are not program or individual demographic specific that will change it and make it better. Katie Hafner: Have you had to go back as so many others have and scrub out some of this language on your website? Words like inclusive, and obviously you can't because it's in your name. Carla Brodley: We kept inclusive because we really mean inclusive in its largest sense. We include everybody. We include white men from every state in this country. Right? It really is inclusive. We always had the mission that we wouldn't work with any particular group. That was always my desire. It was to open up new pathways so that people who had felt excluded could come in, but people who didn't feel excluded but just hadn't noticed it yet could come in as well. Katie Hafner: So to wrap up, I wanted to ask you to give advice to educators at all levels, whether it's primary education all the way up to advanced degrees. What would be your best advice when it comes to opening up young minds? Carla Brodley: I would say look at the systems and the regulations and the way in which you're offering your programs, and think about whether you really have a door that's open to everybody to explore, to discover, and to persist in whatever makes their heart sing, and to make no assumptions that someone who's new to a field isn't good at the field. Katie Hafner: Well, Carla Brodley, I would like to thank you so much for coming on to lost Women of Science Conversations to talk to us about this extremely important topic and all that you're doing. Carla Brodley: Katie, it's been my pleasure to be here with you. And I just wanna share a little personal anecdote that last night my book group met and because I told them you were interviewing me, we decided to listen to the very first season of Lost Women of Science as our book for this session. And we spoke about it last night and oh my God, two of us are scientists that are in the group, and we talked about Rachel Maddow's you know dude Wall and and the two of us that were scientists who had leadership positions shared that we weren't on the dude wall and had to advocate for ourselves to get up there. And I just wanted to say thank you, not only for today, but for the wonderful discussion that we had last night at my book group. Katie Hafner: That's so nice to hear. And just to clarify, the dude wall refers to all the portraits that you see when you go into, say, a museum or a university or a medical school of all the basically white men who are up on the wall. And thank you so much. What a very nice thing that your book group did that. And with that, I would like to thank you for that and also so much for coming on Lost Women of Science Conversations.

Posted on 09/25/2025 9:52:42 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Big U.S. companies are facing heightened scrutiny from Capitol Hill over their use of foreign employees on H-1B visas, with lawmakers raising concerns about layoffs and slumping job prospects for Americans. On Wednesday evening, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) sent letters to the country’s largest users of H-1B visas—including Amazon, Apple and JPMorgan Chase—asking them to explain why they continue to hire thousands of H-1B visa holders while also cutting other jobs. The senators asked for detailed information on how many H-1B workers the companies employ, what wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. The letters cited reporting by the Journal about the weak tech job market. The move comes less than a week after President Trump announced an overhaul of the H-1B program, including a new $100,000 fee for companies sponsoring foreign workers. That move caused panic for some companies worried they could retroactively be on the hook for fee payments. They mobilized HR teams and lawyers to address employee concerns and ensure compliance. The H-1B system, created in 1990, is the primary pathway for foreign professionals to work in the U.S. Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China. Amazon, the largest H-1B sponsor in the U.S., won approval for more than 14,000 new hires on the visa in fiscal 2025—the most of any company—even as it has announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of jobs in recent years.

There are 2 levels of consulting. Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, etal “consult”. In turn these “consulting companies” contract with “body shops” who provide the bodies. The “body shops” are often layered 3 or 5 deep. Also of interest is the location of the bodies. Example: GA Secretary of State contracted with FOD-Friends of Dodd to get HAVA money. In turn FOD contracted with a body shop to do the actual design and coding of the Voter Registration system used in 2020. The body shop allegedly had its bodies in CT to do the work for GA. But only 2 of the 20+ on the project were actually in CT. Repeatedly the body in CT had to fly to India for the funeral of a grandmother or grandfather. We used to joke about how many funerals he attended. He would get on the phone meeting from India. It was clear he was in the same room as all his developers. And when he was on a phone call from CT it was clear he was not in the same room as his developers. In all the discussion of the 2020 election in GA I am the only one who has been pointing this out for over 10 years now. Others discussing the 2020 GA election never mention that the software was developed by those who did not live in, nor understood the laws and customs of the US or GA. Until the complex relationships, often times intentionally complex, are discussed completely, the partial nips are going to be effective? PS in the 2015-2019 period the GA voter registration story was fed to only 2 GA media personalities, as far as I know...Phil and Eric. 17 posted on 09/25/2025 11:05:59 AM PDT by spintreebob [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Frank Drebin They’ll investigate until payment is made.

Title: U.S. lawmakers seek answers from Apple, other major U.S. firms about H-1B visa use amid layoffs

Update font size. Reset U.S. lawmakers have asked major U.S. companies including Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on Thursday to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs. Reuters: ‎ The letter comes after the Trump administration announced last week that it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas, which allow businesses to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The U.S. has also released a proposal that would rework the H-1B visa selection process to favor higher-skilled and better-paid workers. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, asked 10 major employers for detailed information on the number of H-1B workers they employ, the wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: India will come to the table on trade and this will be the bargaining chip that swings the deal. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com. Thank you! Support MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon. If a company is firing more than 2-3% of their workers in any sector, they should not get H-1B visas for that sector. (Fire all the HR, marketing, and advertising execs you want, but not highly trained, experienced positions.) H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed at least a median wage for that position. Maybe the government should insist that H-1B visa holders are always in the 80th percentile or something. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed third party mediation if they suspect their wages aren’t competitive. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed some kind of freedom of movement if they can show their compensation is not competitive. Companies shouldn’t be able to kick H-1B workers to the curb if they point out any kind of exploitation. Any company accepting H-1B workers in any department, can’t fire or “retire” workers in that department for 2-3 years. $100K seems excessive–after all, we do want the best and brightest to come to the USA—but in no way should H-1B visas be allowed to artificially depress workers compensation. No company should be able to have more than 5% of its employees on H-1B visas. Companies asking for H-1B visas must offer significant scholarships, apprenticeships, or work-study programs to American employees to acquire the education/training/degrees necessary in those areas which they claim lack qualified American workers. Companies asking for H-1B visas must donate significant resources to local schools to enhance or kick-start programs in those fields which they claim lack qualified American workers and work closely with those schools to provide apprenticeship programs. Also this: In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation’s shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was “headed for a one-term presidency”. Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done … It infuriates me” The $100K fee should be yearly.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Good morning, This week’s Stratechery Interview is with Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel. Booking is one of my favorite companies in the world: they are a textbook Aggregator. And, in a fascinating twist, they are also among the best at managing Google, the biggest Aggregator of them all. In this interview we discuss both dynamics, starting from Priceline’s acquisition of Booking, the evolution of their business model, and where the company is going in the future. Along the way we discuss network effects and just how powerful they are, the challenges of building customer loyalty and being a destination site, and how AI might finally fulfill the longstanding dream of recreating the travel agent experience.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Glenn Faujelle, welcome to Stratechery. Glenn Fogel: (laughing) Fogel is the name but I will accept. I asked you and you said you wish you had what the French call you. GF: My wife would change the name if it was Faujelle, instead she doesn’t. She goes by her maiden name. Well, it’s appropriate because given Booking’s European roots, but we can get to all that in a moment. I’m very excited to talk to you, I love Booking, I feel like it’s a company I should have written about more. There’s just never been that right moment to really nail it, but you mentioned that you’re a reader, it fits so well with so many things that I’ve written about, all which I want to get to in this interview. But before we get to Booking and get to why I’m interested in it, I do want to start with you and your background, where you grew up, what you thought you would be, and if it would be someone who wants to make his name French because he’s such a big deal on the European continent. GF: Yeah, so I’ll be brief. I grew up outside New York City in the suburbs, very nice suburbia growing up. I have parents who were very into education, they didn’t have college degrees, but they believed the importance of going to school, so I worked very hard. I was 17, a junior in the spring and I was looking forward to in the fall applying to colleges and I had unfortunately a very serious stroke, paralyzed me on my right side, wiped out all my language capabilities, and spent some time coming back up and ended up going to college. How long did that take to recover from? GF: Well, actually because it was the spring of my junior year, I was able to go to college in a year from the following fall so it was a year and some months, I did go. But I worked extremely hard there, I got a degree in finance at what was the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School as an undergraduate, graduated actually early to save some money for my folks. Started working but not in finance, I was working in IT, I was at Morgan Stanley in what was then called MIS, it was their IT shop and that in 1984, but we still had punch card machines. We didn’t use them, but they were there. My first job was putting tapes on drives. Memory used to be in tapes — many of your listeners do not know anything I’m talking about — turned out, ended up doing coding, wasn’t great at it, said I should do something else. It’s the ’80s, M&A was booming, I said, “Well, I’d like to go over to the other side at Morgan Stanley where all those merger and acquisition bankers were making good money”. Can’t just jump from being an IT guy even though I had the finance degree, so I went and got a degree at Harvard Law School. Came out, no intention of being a lawyer, started right at an investment bank called Kidder, Peabody & Co. Rode it into the ground, went eventually went to nothing, got sold to Paine Webber, at which point they let go most of the bankers. So I lost my job, and while was not fun, it did give me the experience of having been let go. Right. GF: So I have that credential. Something you had to be the other end of many years later. GF: Right. Met a woman and eventually she said, “If this relationship’s going to go on, you should get a job”, so I end up being a trader at Morgan Stanley and I did that for a couple years in the late ’90s and the Internet’s booming and I’m saying, “Wow, that seems a lot more exciting”, and I have a background in IT, I got a background in finance, and there was this job at a company called Priceline.com, which was really the darlings of the Internet bubble, so to speak. Right, one of the most insane IPOs at that time. GF: Exactly. It went public in the spring of 1999, right away over a $30 billion valuation, which back then was real money. I didn’t join until February of 2000, I had gotten the job at the end of ’99 and I said, “Listen, I’ll come over, but I just want to get my bonus for Morgan Stanley, they don’t pay you until February, so I got to stay until February”. They said, “No problem”, so I leave my trading job end of February, one week before the NASDAQ peaks, thereby proving that I should not be a trader, having just top ticked the Internet, gone long Internet. So I did that, and the company’s worth about $15 billion at the time and we went down over towards the end of the year to just a couple hundred million dollars market cap. Stock eventually went down to a dollar a share, had to do a reverse split to get it up. Was it a good thing you got that bonus to sort of carry you through? GF: Yeah, it certainly, certainly was. Turns out your stock grant wasn’t worth very much! GF: But imagine what my wife was saying to me. “Let me get this straight now, you left a great paying job, a real good job at Morgan Stanley to this high-flying company?”, but it worked out okay. So the stock on reverse split, $6 a share, way back then, I’ve been there now 25 years and while we’re not quite up to $6,000 a share yet, it’s not far. So easy math almost 1,000 times in 25 years, so it’s worked out okay. Yeah, you’re still married, so I think that’s the biggest endorsement that it all worked out. You’ve talked in other interviews about that stroke and how it grounded you through difficult times and to your point, Booking’s had a few of them. You go back through the Dot Com crash — well, I guess Priceline I should start out with, we’ll get to the Booking portion in a moment. The Dot Com crash, obviously there was 9/11 shortly thereafter, not great for travel, there’s the Great Recession, COVID-19, I mentioned the layoffs bit before, Google’s SERP changes. Okay, maybe that one doesn’t quite fit with the other one, so we can get to that one another time. GF: No, it does. But how did that shape you? And balance, clearly you wanted to chase the big thing, you want to take some risks. What benefit did that bring to you in your leadership style? GF: Well, you listed a bunch and there were so many other very trying moments, many of which we’d have to fill up the entire discussion to go through all of them. But the one thing that’s consistent among all these things is, and it’s the idea that if you’ve been through a crisis, you’re better prepared to deal with the next one. Having actually been in the arena in fighting the fight helps you understand that when you’re in the next one, stay calm, understand what your options are, how to play it. Minimize where there’s potential losses, try and see what other avenues can you go down, maintain flexibility. So again, it’s one of those things when things seem to go all to hell to say, especially the most recent, that pandemic, and there were a lot of people in panic. I’m like, “Hey, been there before, let’s not panic”. In fact, we’ve been through that whole COVID thing, the SARS-1 issue back in 2003 and we’d actually seen the effect of that before. So it was like, “Been there, no, it’s okay, we’ll be fine”. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. I mean it’s funny because I was in Taiwan, went to Taiwan in 2003, and so I was aware of that at the time, it had sort of died down at that point, but it’s interesting to tie it back to that. You’d seen major disruption, people scared to travel. I did want to ask about Priceline, the initial model of which was, “name-your-own-price“, how insane was that in retrospect or do you still think it was a good idea? GF: Well, so the idea of coming up with an opaque process, meaning opaque, you don’t really know what you’re buying, but you’re willing to do it to save a lot of money. Right away that’s not a bad thing. Now if we look in economics, the idea of consumer surplus or supplier surplus, and you see what you end up where you have people, consumers, who either are getting a benefit — they’d be willing to pay more for something, but the price is not at that level. The idea was trying to match up, capture what the person was willing to sell it for, is very good when you have a product you’re selling with very, very low marginal costs. Yep, and somebody needs to stay at a hotel, or they’re not going to make anything. GF: Or an airline, it much more was the airline. So that airline seat, the marginal cost of that seat is essentially zero. Right. GF: So if the airline can fill that up with something without impacting its regular distribution channels because you don’t want to have any type of price cannibalization, and the way that it came out wasn’t a bad idea at all. The problem really was is there aren’t a lot of verticals that that really worked for, and people, for whatever reason, they just don’t like the idea as much about putting in a bid with whether you get no chance to back out. If you put that bid in and somebody accepts it, you got to pay that amount and you’re on and there’s no refund. That’s really interesting because I would think that a big problem with that is it’s offloading a lot of burden onto the customer. It feels very weighty. “Did I put the right price?”, “What do I do?”, “Should I be too high?”, “Should I be too low?”, or is that part and parcel of the fact you can’t back out, you’re locked in once you commit? Or are those two different threads? GF: Well, I think there are two things, but I think they go to the same point. Right, it’s too much cognitive weight on the customer. GF: It’s tremendous. And the thing is, human beings are odd. It’s interesting, one of the things that bothers people almost as much as overpaying is not overpaying but paying more — even though they’re comfortable paying it — more than what somebody else got. The sense of fairness, it permeates everything. GF: But it does because when somebody says, “What is being rich?”, being rich is having more money than your brother-in-law. It’s all relative, and that’s one of the issues too. So in the end, the idea of bidding, not great, but the idea of having opaque pricing with some type of trade-offs is still used a lot. We still have those types of things and people are willing to do it and let’s say we see it in many different instances where people are willing to take a trade-off in terms of what the quality of what you’re buying to get a better price. So we’re going to get to AI in a moment, but as long as we’re here, would AI have made that work better by reducing the cognitive load? Or maybe another way to ask this is will AI-driven variable pricing work in the future in a way that makes customers feel good? And not feeling like, “They know who I am and so they’re screwing me”? GF: It’s very interesting to think, “How will the world of the future be if everybody has an agent and the agent is able to instantly be always checking for prices?”. And at the same time, the seller also has an agent that’s always looking at what is the current price and how does that work? As markets get very, very transparent, it’s going to be very interesting. Now the topping of all this though will be regulations because it’s also interesting where again, this idea of fairness, and which is an interesting concept, of regulators coming out and saying, “Well, is that fair or not?”, where you could have two parties, the seller and the buyer, both feel it’s fine and they’re happy. But the regulator says, “That’s not a fair market”, and starts putting in rules. So I can’t predict really what’s going to happen, but I agree with you, it’s going to be very interesting how it plays out. So when you bought Booking in 2005, what was your mindset when you bought the company? And the reason I asked, did you just think you were expanding internationally buying another travel site? Both you and Expedia were being very aggressive at that time, or did you realize you were buying an entirely different business model? I’d love for you to explain to me the difference in how Priceline acquired rooms back then and what Booking did and why that ended up being a big deal? GF: Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t have enough time to really go into all the nitty-gritty. Oh, no, I actually think this part is super, super interesting. So spend as much time as you want. GF: Okay, so we have the name-your-own-price product at Priceline, and I come in and I’m corporate development and we want to expand internationally with name-your-own-price. So we’re doing it throughout the world, different ways we create different structures and one structure was we set up this joint venture type operation in Europe, it’s Priceline Europe. Terrible timing, 9/11, and then you have recession and we pull back, etc. so it’s a very, very small operation now in Europe and we let go a lot of the people and I am now actually in charge of that. And I’m saying, “This is the craziest thing in the world”, because the idea of name-your-own-price to get a flight from London to Paris when you can go on Ryanair and EasyJet and pay five pounds, you’re going to save 50%, so it’s £2.50, really? Who’s going to do that? You end up with Frankfurt. You go London, Frankfurt, Paris, nobody’s going to do that. We got to do stuff the old fashion way, in addition, hotels. So we stopped the flight stuff, that’s ridiculous, but the hotel thing is okay. Name-your-own-price for hotels, but still people like to know the price and they like to know what they’re getting exactly. So I’m looking around, who knows how to sell like that around here? And find a little company called Active Hotels in the UK. Meet up with the people, we end up buying that in 2004, $165 million US dollars with an earn out for the founders who I want to stay on because the real value in anything is the people, it’s not like a coal mine where you’ve got coal underground, this is the people, and so we create a structure that gives them the upside if we’re really successful. So that happens in, when did that happen? 2004, in the summer of 2004, we end up in the fall of 2004, I am introduced to the people at Booking.com who are based in Amsterdam. They have almost the exact same model as Active Hotel, they’re disclosing everything just like you normally would by hotels but both Active and Booking have something slightly different than how the really big player, Expedia back then was the big player, and some of the other ones are. The difference is if you went to Expedia, you put your credit card in and you are essentially being charged right there. Merchant model, it’s called. Expedia is acquiring the room and you’re buying it from Expedia. GF: Well no, they’re not actually. Legally, they don’t actually own the room. In fact, what they have is the money in their bank account. Oh, so they get float along the way. GF: Which they are not planning to pay the hotel until after the person actually stays in the hotel and back then it would’ve been like a month afterwards. Really bad for cash flow for the hotels, really good cash flow for Expedia. Active had a different way of doing it called the agency model, which was, we’ll take the credit card, but that’s only to guarantee that you’ll actually show up. We’re not actually taking the money, the money was not run, the credit card was not run. So essentially, when you showed up at the hotel under Active Hotels, you paid the hotel at the desk with your credit card, or cash, or whatever, then Active sent afterwards an invoice to the hotel to pay the commission on it, totally reverse in the way the cash flow works. Booking had the exact same model as Active Hotel. So the issue was the more business you did, the faster you grew, especially with Booking because they had to pay Google up front in that month, but they weren’t going to get paid for months later, the hotel was going to pay him months later. The faster you grew, the worst your negative cash flow can get worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. So that’s one of the reasons we were able to convince them to join our little band. So Booking came into, and we combined Active and Booking to one company, and we threw in Priceline Europe too. But Booking’s a better name, so we kept it as Booking.com, and that’s the story. But here’s the question, though. You’re able to buy them because they have this problematic cash cycle. GF: And we bought them because they were totally European base, pretty much, Active was mostly the UK, so they could share and we put the inventory together, so now they’re both better off. And look, you spend a lot of time talking about network effects, etc, well here where you really have a great benefit by being able to add a lot more of the inventory to show to a particular traveler. That’s one of the big benefits. For sure, we’re definitely going to get to all that, but I’m very curious about this because from my perspective, the agency model is a critical component of what makes Booking what it is, into the behemoth that it has become. I talk about Aggregation Theory, and one of the things is the scalability aspect, all aspects need to be scalable and with this model, you have more from a hotel perspective, more scalability, more ability to come on, and you don’t need these custom integrations or whatever it might be. To me, that seems essential, so you acquiring the agency model seems super important to me, and it’s really striking to hear actually you talk about the real downsides of it, and the reason why it was a struggle for these companies. GF: Well back then that was certainly one of the ways we were able to grow rapidly was because go to a hotel and say, “Listen, just give us your content, just give us your photos, just tell us the prices, we’ll put it on”. We don’t need to make a business deal, yeah. GF: Yeah, and then if somebody shows up, we’re going to send you an invoice, and please pay us. Now part of the problems in that model for a lot of people who tried that in the past, was the hotels didn’t pay. So in the US for example, the actual collection rate for a travel agency was very bad, hotels would just ignore the commission letter, say, “Who cares about them?”, so that was a critical part too was collections, having a system to be able to collect the commissions. That was critical, and one among many different things that was done at the time that really made it different than a lot of other companies that historically had always done the commission-based agency model. What I’m curious about is did you go in thinking, “Okay, Booking has this, we’re going to change it to our model”? And then was there a point where you realized, “No, actually for all the challenges that this model presents, it’s actually better”. Why is it better? Why did that matter? GF: What’s good is having both models, Priceline was always the merchant model starting out. When we went into Asia, and we have the agency model at Booking.com, I was concerned, “Would it still work there?”, so we also looked at another company, very, very small company called Agoda. And Agoda based in Bangkok, they had the merchant model, and we ended up buying Agoda too, and now we keep them separate brands, separate things. Now, both have agency and merchant in different ways at different places, and the consumer gets to chose and there are many reasons people choose one versus the other. But having more choice is really an important benefit when you’re going to a customer. And I’ll go on, it’s now in terms of the way people pay, it’s incredible. So I think we’re over 40 maybe now, different ways a consumer can pay us, and we take the money and send it to the hotel, which is really important. If you are a consumer in Shanghai, and you’re going to show up at a small little hotel in the South of France, and you want to show up at the desk and use your whatever, Alipay or your WeChat Pay, that French hotel’s going to say, “What are you talking about? Please give me euros”, and that’s not it, but we are in-between it. We will take the Alipay or WeChat Pay, and we will then put euros in the bank account of the French hotel. And by the way, it’ll be a lot cheaper for the French hotel than if they had gotten a credit card from the traveler, because the interchange is much higher than us putting money into their bank account. So the answer to your question is payments is really important it’s the reason why we do a tremendous amount of our business is now done in the merchant model, not the agency model. Interesting. GF: There are a lot of benefits to it. So the agency model got all these folks on board, and then over time once you had that relationship built in, you could circle back to the merchant model. That makes a lot of sense. GF: Right. Exactly. Going back to this buildup aspect, another critical piece of Booking from my perspective is that the hotel market in Europe, particularly 20 years ago, was far more fragmented. You just have a lot more independent hotels as opposed to the US being more chains and things along those lines. This seems to me to cut in multiple dimensions. First to the agency model point, that scalability bit and it being super easy to get linked up seems really important. And second, this really just landed you right in the sweet spot of an aggregator, where consumers see way more hotels than they would anywhere else. And from a hotel, you suddenly are seen by way more customers than anywhere else. This seems obvious now, I guess I’m stating things that seem clear about network effects, but did you realize this when you bought Booking — I’m just really curious, because the Booking acquisition was such a home run. One of the things you did as CEO was change the name, “Okay, we’ve held on to Priceline for too long, we are Booking”, again, it’s not a home run, it’s a grand slam. I’m just curious how much of this did you learn along the way versus, “Oh, this is how it’s going to happen”? GF: No, these are all well understood concepts long before we started buying hotel agencies, like Booking.com. I had studied network theory long before that and I mean the basis of the Internet, or even going either further back, and there’s the famous when you’re in school you learn about, “Well, one telephone has a value of nothing”. Metcalfe’s law, yeah. GF: Of course it is. Right, exactly. You start getting into, “Well what is the value of a network?”, Ii it the square of the number of nodes, or how do you want to figure out the math of what is? But sure, of course that was all well understood and recognized why it would be such a valuable, valuable thing to have. But everybody knew that, and didn’t matter whether we were agency or merchant, everyone has built a network as quickly as possible, as fast as possible. What’s interesting, of course, is why did some of the networks that were out front, they got really good, but then they die out where others continue? We don’t have time to go into that, and theories of why did MySpace die but Facebook lived? Well let’s do it in travel. Why did Booking, why did you pass Expedia? Why did you become the top dog? GF: There are a lot of reasons that go into a question, and here we go into the idea of coming up with the narrative fallacy, which it’s a famous saying. Where we’re going to create a story about why the world is the way it is today, it’s not provable. You’re tapping into what I keep trying to pry around the edges of, because I know the story you tell. There’s a story I look backwards and see, and this is all straightforward, and I’m just so curious about how you actually navigated this story way back then, when it’s, again, it’s really easy to look backwards and everything seems so obvious. GF: Of course, that’s the issue of the narrative fallacy. And I can tell my story, and you have your story, many people have many stories about it, but there’s no way to actually prove out what is true and what is not true. I do know that I have a belief of certain things that are very critical. I also know, and this is really important for anybody who’s in a business with anything in life really, is that so much of the ultimate results are going to be determined by things you have zero control over. I can’t control what our competitors do, I can’t control what governments do in terms of economics, I can’t control issues like natural disasters, and so many things are going to impact your business. In our business, my Lord, things hit us all the time, and the only thing we can do is control ourselves. So try and improve the products, improve the services, so that both sides of our marketplace, our travelers and our partners, both see value in participating at our business, at their free will and that’s very important for us is that look, no hotel in the world has to work with us, they do it because we give them value to do it. And by the way, some hotels don’t. I even stay at hotels that are not on our network, because they don’t want to be on our network, but I want to stay in that hotel. There’s a place in Lake George in upstate New York— That’s a lot of throat-clearing, though. So what is your narrative that you’re going to give my audience? What is the key thing why you surpassed everyone? GF: I won’t do that, and here’s why, because I give it, and then it gives it more weight, and more credence, and more belief that was the truth. There is no truth. The only thing I can say is part of the reason is we worked damn hard, part is we had really smart driven people who wanted to succeed. Part of it is they came up with ways to provide more service, more value to both sides than other players did and being a friendlier partner, being better customer service, really focusing on it, customer centricity, those things were really, really important, but that’s kind of like table stakes for a lot of companies do that. All right, fair enough. I’ll let you off the hook. Tell me about your relationship with Google. I don’t know if it’s still the case, I know for a long time you were the biggest Google ad spender and I believe that really happened around sort of the tail ends of the 2000s, early 2010s, when that really ramped up. Was that driven by Google’s change of the SERP and moving away from ten blue links into their own travel product, and you realized, “Hey, game’s changed, we have to approach this differently”? What was the process there, and how has that evolved? GF: Interesting, so when we were about to buy Booking.com, and we already owned Active Hotels, Active Hotels was very into SEO, all free search, very into that and they also had a lot of affiliates that were really bot farms, they were all farms, and we got a lot of business from them. Booking, on the other hand, and this is another reason we wanted to combine them both, is Booking was really into SEM [Search Engine Marketing], they were paying, and they really became really one of the first players that I’m aware of that did really big A/B testing, really interesting science going into that stuff. Right before we buy Booking, Google does a giant change in the algo, and we drop so much business on all the free clicks, it was like, “Wow, what’s happened?”. That’s when we really tilted more, “Okay, so we just have to keep paying more and more into Google”, and optimizing it so we actually have a good ROI, which we did, and continued to work on that. That was before 2010, that was 2005, 2006, 2007. Then of course, you have the financial crisis, etc., but we still power through that. And that’s it, now I have no idea who the biggest spenders are with Google now, Google does not disclose, we do spend a heck of a lot of money with them, it’s a very good relationship, we’re good partners. We have a similar goal, and that is to get customers to get what they want as soon as they can. I think that your approach to Google, for me, is a big part of the narrative story, and in two respects. Number one, there are other people in this space who got very large on SEO that basically their response to Google’s changes was to whine and whine incessantly for years and years and years and I feel there’s a very sort of pragmatic approach from Booking for years that, to your point, you can’t control what happens around you. You sort of play the hand that you’re dealt, and you dealt that by we’re going to pay. What I’m curious about is, and this is sort of part two, is there an aspect where you’re dealing with Google, the ultimate aggregator, gave you more sympathy for the hotels, and dealing with you and knowing how to deal with them since you’re sort of sitting on top of them in that role? Or was there the opposite where just shit flows downhill sort of as it might be? I’m just curious, you’re in a unique position of clearly being an aggregator, one of the most textbook aggregators ever, and yet also you have to be aggregated by Google, and sort of navigate that, and figure it out. GF: I do talk about this sometimes, it comes up. So we’ll have a hotel here, and let’s say we’re charting a 15% commission, and they’re not thrilled with having to pay 15% to us. Of course, we have to pay a big amount to Google to get the traffic to us, right? And so, you’re right, there is this relationship, and the big overall point is nobody likes to pay for marketing or distribution. Everybody would like all their business to come to them free, direct, loyal, again, and again, and again. People being people, that’s not exactly how the world works, so you do have to pay. Then the next thing is you want to at least make sure that it’s a fair relationship and that’s really critical with our hotel partners, is saying, “Yes we are charging 15%, but we are getting you incremental demand”, and you understand this very well from your points earlier about understanding what’s the incremental cost to that hotel, so a hotel room that goes empty that night, that’s zero revenue, zero profit. However, you fill that up at $100, well what’s the real cost to that? Well, the incremental cost is essentially nothing, you already paid for the mortgage. You’re just fighting over margin. GF: Exactly! So we take 15% out of 100%. It’s actually a very good deal for them, which is why they do it so it’s all fine. With us and Google is if we didn’t think we were getting a good ROI, we wouldn’t be spending it. Come on, it’s not just Google, well, whether it be Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, pick your channel, we are always looking to get the ROI, always looking, “Where can we optimize?”, and that’s one of the benefits we get to our hotelier friends, partners, is the idea is make sure that we are giving them a good ROI, and helping them out. Because if we don’t, they can go to Expedia more, there’s so many different ways they can distribute their rooms, because they want to maximize their bottom line. I mentioned how your position might give you more sympathy for your suppliers in this regard. Now that you’re, I think, are you still the only European company that’s been designated as a gatekeeper by the EU? GF: There are seven companies in the world that have been designated by the EU as gatekeepers. Unbelievably so, six of the seven are American, we’re one of them. We’re an American company, Booking Holdings is incorporated in the US, we are headquartered in the US. Booking.com is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. Right. GF: The seventh company that’s a gatekeeper that’s not the US, though, maybe it will be very shortly is TikTok. So, there is no European company. Does that give you more sympathy for Google now that you’re feeling some of their pain? (laughing) GF: This is one of the things that I talked to the EU about, I talked to many people about this. I absolutely believe, I absolutely believe that the DMA, the way to set up its gatekeepers is not set up correctly. The idea that we, in one of the most competitive industries in the world, and I had a good headline quote in the Financial Times in London once, I said, “We have to fight for a booking every day”, because it’s true. You’re just one click away from somebody choosing somebody else, it is incredibly competitive. So, the idea to put us in the same bucket as trillion dollar businesses like Google and Amazon? That’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd. And yet what it does, it creates the costs, and the things we have to deal with that are much more difficult, thereby making it actually, we have a lot of European employees, so it actually makes it more difficult for European employees there, it has to be able to expand, etc. To me it just baffles the mind and I believe somebody said, “Well, you want to talk about reason to stories? My story in this is it’s politics.” Well, all the hotels, to your point, they want all the customers you deliver them, and they don’t want to pay for them. GF: Of course not. They’ve complained about it. GF: Exactly. That’s absolutely right, and I understand that. Listen, that’s part of a free world, if you can lobby better than we can lobby, I guess it’s not good for economics, it’s not good for society, but it’s good for an individual player. I do have a bone of contention to pick with you, and you referenced it earlier. I, like many other professionals my age, was an extremely loyal Starwood member back in the day. It breaks my heart to see how Marriott has diminished those brands after acquiring Starwood in 2016 and the reason I’m blaming you, laying it at your feet, is it seems hotels realize that to avoid the way around you, or the way around aggregation in general is you need these super good loyalty programs and a good way to have that is to have the most hotels. So, I’m asking you, are you the reason why I now get crappy plastic cups, and uncomfortable pillows in Westin’s when that wasn’t the case before? Because you made all these guys consolidate, and try to get out from your fees? GF: So, I’d first like to say that I am also very fond of Marriott at all of their brands. (laughing) Of course you are! GF: And Hilton, and I can go through the entire list… That was on me, Glenn was grimacing the whole time for those that are listening. GF: (laughing) Right, right. Look, here’s the thing I believe that- I’m actually asking you in general about the hotel’s response to getting larger and things like that. GF: It’s not just hotels. Look, everybody’s trying to come up with, “How can I get the customers to be more loyal?”, I mean, American Express just sent out the bill, if I want to have a platinum card, it’s going to cost $895. Meanwhile, Chase Sapphire, they’re being the cheap guys at $795, and I think there’s a Capital One that I know, $495, whatever. Everybody’s playing the loyalty, trying and bring more benefits, and they all show that if you pay this yearly fee, look at all the great benefits you’re going to get for it, it’ll actually pay more. There’s nothing wrong with people coming up with new ways to try, and combine things to create more value and I have nothing against it. By the way, and I’ve been talking with all the big chains about this stuff. We need to have a relationship where I know they feel that if somebody booked with us who is a high status loyalty member, their company is saying, “Gee, is it fair for them to pay us the same amount of money they paid us somebody who’s never visited their hotels before?”, and I do agree with that, and we need to come up with a way that actually, while I’m not sure one will make any more money, or they’ll make any more money, but at least it’ll be a fair, and we used the word fair before, it’s a fair transaction. If we could imagine a model where the commission is different if they’ve put in their loyalty number, or something along those lines. GF: Totally, totally like that. Exactly. And by the way, and while we don’t do this, I mean look, some of these giant chains as big as they are, they don’t market to certain parts of the world. We market to people in Turkistan, or pick a place they don’t and we do things in over 40 languages, we have customer service for over 40 languages, they don’t. So, we are rolling benefits to them, that’s the thing they want is the incremental customer. I put that list of crises earlier. Was Airbnb a crisis when it came along, or do you feel like in the end they just actually expanded the market, more places to stay, more types of trips, whatever it might be? Or was it actually — what was your process of facing this orthogonal competitor? You still talked on your last earnings call about alternative bookings, is it still a real center of focus for you? GF: So, alternative accommodations in the last call, we talked about it over, I think it was 37% of our total room nights. Now when you add up what that number means, that’s almost a little under almost three quarters of the total number of room nights that Airbnb did, and we’ve outgrown them, 16 of the last 17 quarters we’ve grown faster. So, I’d say it’s a pretty big deal for us and it has been for some time. So one of those things that seemed like a crisis, and has actually turned out to be a huge opportunity. GF: It never was a crisis, it was just another area where we need to build, and we didn’t have the right processes, we didn’t have the right platform, we weren’t necessarily doing things as well as we could have. And by the way, I said this in my last call, I said, there’s still a lot of things we can improve in that product for our customers and our hosts in a way that they will prefer to use us more and that’s something which is good. That actually means there’s actually a lot of upside left for us, and I believe that, I really believe that. Is your key advantage just the fact that if I’m searching, if I search on Airbnb, it’s only Airbnbs. If I search on Expedia, I can see both then compare, or is there more that goes into it? GF: Well, I’d say that’s a big one right from the beginning and I’ve said this so many times that one of our advantages was that I did notice that [Airbnb CEO] Brian [Chesky] recently was talking about how they’re going to be in a lot more hotels. I’ve been saying that for years. Airbnb, I mean obviously it was a great idea, could create an entirely new market. There’s a lot of strategic decisions they’ve made in the last X number of years that I don’t completely get. GF: Well, so, I imagine that we will be seeing more of that competition coming from that area. But look, it’s all good. I like competition, it helps us all do a better job for both sides of the marketplace. So, something you’ve championed for a long time, well before AI, is this idea of delivering a Connected Trip, you bought OpenTable, and you’ve bought lots of other companies along the way. What is that? Explain, give me the high level thesis. How have you approached it? This feels a little like, “Let’s put ourselves in a pre-AI mind”, because I’m going to ask you how AI changes that. I’ll give you a preview of the next question. Is this a bit where it sounds good in theory, but it’s not actually the way customers operate? GF: So, a couple ways to approach this. One way I always like to explain it is when I was younger, much, much younger, and my family would set up a trip somewhere. There is a thing called a travel agent that was a human being, many times was a woman, and she knew a lot about our family, and what we liked, and how much we could afford and she’d come up with some ideas, and my parents would have conversation with her, and such, and then she’d come up with a couple things, and we’d buy it, and we had everything, all the things we needed, the flights, how to get to the airport, the hotels, what to do there, all that stuff, and we give her one check, my mother would write a check to her and be done. God forbid anything went wrong, we just called her, and she would fix it all. Magically it would all get fixed, it’ll all be fine. Now technology should be able to recreate that only much, much better, because the database doesn’t forget like I imagine the travel agent human probably did occasionally. Well, that, and it’s much more accessible. GF: It’s 24/7, 24/7, and in addition, which is really good, it has an ability to know so much more about what’s happening at the exact time, or in the future. So, for example, the human travel agent never would’ve been able to, when the plane is delayed by four hours to send out a text, and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Fogel, your plane right now will be late by four hours, but we have a different flight for you, would you like to change it? In addition now because you’re going to still arrive two hours late to your destination, we’ve already rearranged the car service for you, and in addition, so you’ll no longer make your dinner reservation, we’ve already tried to move that to a different time, but that restaurant doesn’t have availability at that later time, however, we have looked at three other restaurants that are in the near vicinity. Would you like to choose one of those instead, which has availability, and we’ll notify your partner so that person knows we’ll be there.” What I want is I want to have a third spouse in our, my wife, and relationship who does all of this for us. Only it’s not going to be human, it will be done digitally. Right. This all sounds amazing. But you launched the Connected Trip idea a long time ago, and in retrospect, particularly when you look at AI, and how AI can potentially do this, were you just way too early, and this sounds good in theory, but actually there’s so many difficulties in pulling this off? Where actually we just have a holding company of a bunch of different companies that in theory work together, but it’s not a doable project? GF: I do not disagree with you on your point that it’s taking a long time. Agree totally, but you have to think where we came from, all we had were hotels. We didn’t have a flight business at all, we really started that 2019, just started it. So, five years later, let’s round off, call it five years later, we now sell more airline tickets than any other third party distributor in the world except for China, a little different, so we’ll do it ex China. That’s amazing in just five years to do that. In addition, the increase our Attractions now, we had no attraction business at all, now we doubled the last quarter, we doubled the number of Attractions. Our car rental business continued to grow. Rides, instead of renting a car, you just get a ride service from the airport, or to the airport, insurance, so many things. We had to build all these different verticals, and now having done that now, bringing it together, using science, using data, analyzing it, making sure we are putting up the right offers at the right time with the right value to the right person so they get the best experience they can. And God forbid anything goes wrong, we as the person who actually has put it all together, with the relationship with everyone, we can fix it. Now that’s for the traveler. On the partner side, the supplier side, we’re giving incredible number of different opportunities for them to provide, get incremental demand by providing different values, different things. We have a thing called our Genius program where primarily the supplier fund discounts, because we’re giving it to certain customers who pay more, who are willing to do it more often, so we give more value to our supplier partners. Combining those two things, using again all the data analytics, it’s going to be wonderful. Now you’re right with generative AI, it may be easier to do all this stuff, don’t disagree with that. Your point, it’s hard is very correct, which is good, because if it was easy, there’d be a lot more people doing it. What’s more important? Is it the demand side, or the supplier side? And I know the answer is both. They’re both really important, or does it matter in different stages of the evolution of your company? For example, I thought it was really interesting, you made the point that agency model was important to get that demand, but over time, merchant actually lets you deliver a better experience for both sides, and so you’ve seen some transition there. Is that the case different when you’re building a network effect, which one comes first if you want to add on a connected experience? GF: I think the problem is when you’re overweight one side of that type of equation, you end up with real big problems and whether, I know you did a recent, it was very interesting interview with [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi], shout out for the interview you do with Dara because I thought it was fascinating, but it’s very similar network effect. If you have too many drivers, you’ve got a problem. If you don’t have enough drivers, and a lot more people want rides, you’ve got a problem. Same thing for us. If we have too much demand, and there is no supply, we’ve got a problem, the customer’s unhappy. Similar the other way, if a supplier puts out a line, they’re not getting any business, they get tired, and they stop working with you. Right. It’s like, “What’s the point of paying this 15%? I thought that I was supposed to be getting lots of customers”. GF: Well, no, don’t forget about they only pay the 15% if they get the demand. That’s a very important point to make out, which I continue to make to anyone who is interested in the issue of what value do we provide, I say, “Look at what we do here, we’ll take all the inventory, we’ll take the content, we’ll take the photos, we’ll give suggestions how to do things better, we will translate it into forty-something different languages, we’ll go out, and get demand, and we’ll make sure that your property is shown to the right customers. We do all of that, and I’m not going to charge you a thing, it’s free, absolutely free. The only thing I ask is if, if you get a customer who stays in your hotel, would you please pay us a fair commission?” That’s it, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal for everybody, and for everybody who comes out, and says, “Oh, well they have too much power, or whatever”, people come out and say — I say, “What are you talking about? You don’t like it? Don’t join!”. Something Booking is hailed for, we were talking about this before in your story. I appreciate that I don’t want to land a specific narrative, it is what it is, we work hard, all those bits and pieces, just between you and I, however, is the actual answer to Booking’s durability, is it really just a network effect thing? This ties into what’s more important, demand or supply? The answer is both, they’re both important and you have both. Are network effects still underrated in terms of how you survive through paradigms? How do you avoid disruption? And the answer is if you have a network effect, you have the time and space to figure it out, and that’s okay because to your point, you’re motivated and you have the business model where both sides benefit. But do we still underrate these concepts you’ve been studying for so long? GF: I go the other way. I’d say that the network effect is overrated. Interesting. GF: Terribly overrated. Well, tell me why. GF: And a lot of antitrust people think that, and you can go back to the A&P cases way back, I don’t know how long, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, probably more actually maybe 70 years ago. The fact is that there are lots of very similar networks out there. You mentioned Bonvoy and Marriott, huge network effects there. Tremendous. All the airlines, tremendous. All our competitors, similar. Trip.com, they actually do more total travel value than we do probably. I tell you this idea that there’s some sort of lock-in effect, which is really what people start talking when they start networks, they start going to this idea of some sort of lock-in, there is no lock-in and I have the proof of so many of our customers do not spend a lot of their travel budget with us entirely. They use lots of different ways throughout the year, they’ll use us for some other times. They’ll go direct to the hotel, sometimes they’ll go to a tour operator, there’s so many different things. The data proves really that at least in travel, I won’t try and go beyond my expertise, in travel, the network effects are very low. There is incredible competition and those that say otherwise are ignoring the facts and the data and the science. I’m going to disagree with you slightly, but not completely, in that my contention is that the network effects enjoyed by your service, the aggregators, is because by definition you’re delivering value. To your point, hotels get free marketing until they actually make money and then you’re taking a commission on that. It’s not like they’re paying to get on there because you’re not the only way to reach customers, you have to earn it, quite literally. You have to actually deliver a booking. GF: Yeah, exactly. In fact, here’s the thing. Do you know in terms of Europe, our biggest market, we only have a single teens percentage of the market of hotels? That means 85% or roughly somewhere in that neighborhood of hotels that are being booked are not going through us. So anybody come up and say, “You have a 15% share, but you’re a dominant player”, is that not one of the craziest things you’ve ever heard? I mean, don’t get me started on European craziness, but I think the reason I’m pushing on this is network effects are a good thing. Being able to find any hotel in one place is convenient and it’s great. Being able to acquire more customers is convenient and great. GF: I agree. So that’s why I push back, I think there is network effects. GF: No, I agree. I’m saying not as big. So we’re just sort of arguing semantics. It’s not railroads, it’s not cables, that’s the problem. GF: I agree, totally. I’m saying it’s not as powerful as some people think it is. It definitely is, there’s value definitely, it’s just to my thing and there are a lot of others who have the exact same type of network. Where is Booking, when you look forward 5 to 10 years, is it still the arc we’re following? It’s this Connected Trip, we can tell, to your point, I think the problem with a lot of these Connected Trips ideas, particularly before, is it’s a good narrative. It sounds great, I’m going to have the travel agent deliver it and the number of edge cases and complexity in the real world is just so large, it’s never been doable. But is this a bit where actually, that’s probably right, but all that investment was worth it because suddenly it is doable. Did I just summarize what’s the next decade for you? GF: Well, I think you did. I mean our goal is to get that Connected Trip really in a way that a lot of people really see the values. I’m going to go to Booking because I get a lot more value through the Connected Trip and we’re seeing a little, like we did announce in our earnings call, how the growth of people who are buying more than one vertical in a trip has gone up. I believe it was over 30% is what we said a couple months ago. I just read it about an hour ago, so I remember that. GF: Okay, good, so my memory isn’t gone. If you notice, it broke into the double-digit percentage of our total amount of transactions, so it’s showing it is growing, but we are still so early. I believe this is one of these things where you do hit a phase transition, you build up the verticals, you start going, but then at some point, instead of it going linearly, you get exponential growth as people really catch on. This really is much better. Is this going to have to be a product-led growth strategy? Can you SEM yourself into this or is that you almost have to build a new muscle in that regard? GF: I think the marketing of it will be important to help get people aware of it, but I don’t want to put on a firehose of marketing until it’s really good. That makes sense. This is the other interesting point where you can have sympathy for hotels, you have your own loyalty program, you want people opening Booking first thing instead of going through Google to get there and you mentioned the Genius program and how your suppliers will help fund that because you’re consistently delivering more people. Is that a big focus going forward? Do you feel good about that? Is that going to be critical to getting the Connected Trip working? GF: What I really want to be able to do is help our partners do better, I want them to make more money than they would otherwise, I want them to have happier customers than they would otherwise. One of the ways that we’ll be able to do that is by providing them incremental demand right away. That’s great and all that, and I understand where somebody say, “I wish I didn’t have to pay a commission for that customer”, but I want to help make sure they understand that they wouldn’t have gotten that person. But there’s more. We know technology is now coming forward so rapidly, so many of these hotels, they don’t have IT departments, they don’t understand, they don’t know how to deal with this. We will do it for them for free. Again, all the things we do for them, and believe me, this is not dissimilar when you go back to the mid to late ’90s when hotels didn’t have websites, they didn’t know what to do or how to do this or whatever, somebody did it for them. Well that’s kind of now in this new world with all this new technology, we were able to provide the service to them again in a way that they will be better off, their bottom line’s improved. Do you think there’s a shift where you keep talking about, “You’re really valuable, people shouldn’t be mad at us, we’re providing incremental revenue to assets that are already there”, but there’s one thing that I think is interesting about the ultimate aggregators is in some respects they create their own supply and maybe this is where Airbnb was really interesting and got there first, and you’ve done a very good job catching up to them, but creating their own supply of rooms that only exist because Airbnb. I talk about Facebook creating an entire universe of e-commerce retailers that basically exists because of Facebook, that gives them real durability. What market can you create as opposed to servicing hotels that exist and we’re going to give you incremental revenue there or has that already happened? GF: I think you’re right. In both examples you gave, they did create new blue ocean markets that did not exist previously and more power to them for having done that. We, as you point out, we are basically making a markets more efficient, providing more value to people who are already into the marketplace. So for us to create a new market, we’d have to be going on to something that is not currently being done. Now, if we have such a thing, I would not be disclosing it right now. Right, fair enough. But it’s fair to say, and if you were to even do the Connected Trip, but most of the stuff, you’re not talking about Airbnb, Airbnb is still like, “We’re going to create experiences X, Y, Z”, you’re like, “No, you can get your car and then get your hotel and get your restaurant, that’s what Booking does, it makes it more efficient”. GF: And very important. But services, what we call Attractions, are very important because nobody goes on a trip to hang out in the hotel room, you go to do stuff. So whether it be the scuba trip, the snorkeling, the museum, the theater, whatever it is, we want to be able to provide that to them too. One of the examples of the Connected Trip, I always give an example that I love, which is you go to Amsterdam, the two things most people want to do, they want to take a canal boat ride in Amsterdam and they want to go to the Rijksmuseum because it’s very famous museum, great things. Now the thing is though, we want to be able to provide, which we can now, we provide it to both tickets for both things. Imagine you have booked the Thursday for the boat trip and the Friday for the museum. On Tuesday, however, we notice, we obviously see what the weather is and we come back say, “You know something, the rain is coming for your boat ride day and it’s going to be sunny the other day, so why don’t we switch them around for you and we can do it all. Would you like that? Press yes.” And we will do it all for you, that kind of convenience and that looking forward to provide what could be a problem beforehand, that’s real value. Those are the type of things absolutely a part of the Connected Trip. Is that another advantage of Booking in particular’s European roots? It always strikes me, all these European sites have their own technology stack from like 25 years ago, whereas U.S. is just like, “Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t want to do that, we’ll jump on sort of something else”. Is that a real opportunity to go in and provide a brand new technology stack for all these experiences telling them this is the advantage you’ll get? GF: So we have a company that’s the leader in the space, FareHarbor, which we own, which works for us and provides the backend ticketing and reservations for a lot of small and medium-sized Attraction players. We are the biggest player in the world in that, so that is our stack that we do provide, free again, to things and think of it as like OpenTable, which we also have only, FareHarbor’s for attractions, OpenTable for restaurants, etc. But you’re right, there are a lot of different backend systems, but the wonderful world of APIs, you can tie to anybody. Got it. Well, I could talk about Booking forever. Like I said, it’s such a textbook example and it’s so interesting that it’s on both sides of this equation, but did we get what you wanted to cover? GF: Yeah, it has been really fun, really interesting. I mean, it’s fascinating. As you’ve done in many of your interviews, you just scratch the surface because there’s so many interesting things in the topics that you cover, but this certainly is one, and today with Gen AI coming down the pike for all of us, how will the world change? It’s going to be a very interesting thing Google — are they going to be your most important channel forever? GF: Who knows, right? Who knows about that? And I would even more so are the big societal issues and these are the issues not so much about how we do our business, but how do all of us do our business and what are the impacts going to be in terms of employment, in terms of jobs? These are interesting things that I wish our government friends would spend a lot more time on that as opposed trying to guess what’s happening in small vertical areas. Do you think you might see a fork in the road where you want to deliver this experience in Booking and be that destination and tie it all together, but actually the ChatGPT’s of the world might actually be where all trip planning happens and you’re just going to have to, like you did with Google back in the day, accept that and be the best at that? GF: It’s certainly a possibility, we’ll see how it plays out. We are currently and have announced many relationships, many deals with many of the players in the space, and there’ll be many more in the future. Look, there are going to be people I absolutely know are going to go to a large language model provider and want to start their trip planning discovery there and I’m going to lament and say, “Why did they start with us first?”, it’ll be just like hotel, “Why didn’t they come direct?”, it’ll be the same thing, but I like to believe that we will create things that are so great the same way we have over 60% of our customers currently come to us direct. When you X out the B2B business, you go just the B2C business, over 60%, it’s mid-60s actually come to us direct. They’re not going to Google first, they’re not going to anybody. I would like that to actually be even a higher number down the road and they’re coming at the very beginning of their discovery area. But if they don’t, you’ll figure it out and be there. GF: If they don’t, we catch them later in the funnel and we’re still able to be able to get paid well, it’s all good. Glenn Fogel, thanks for coming on. GF: Thank you very much for having me.

Title: 3 Ways Companies Can Support Working Mothers Facing Rigid RTO Mandates
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizelting/2025/09/24/3-ways-companies-can-support-working-mothers-facing-rigid-rto-mandates/

ByLiz Elting, Contributor. Juggling family and work responsibilities continues to be a constant challenge for many working parents, especially mothers. According to FlexJobs’ “Working Parents Report,” half of U.S. professionals say working mothers face higher standards than working fathers, while only 17% say the reverse. The report also found that over half of working women feel they shoulder the most responsibilities at both work and home, and that over half of working parents downplay caregiving duties to their employer to appear more committed. What’s more, recent return-to-office (RTO) mandates implemented this year by companies like JPMorgan, Amazon, and AT&T may further undermine work-life balance and gender equity for working parents, particularly for working mothers with young children who often rely on flexible work options to help balance work and family responsibilities. According to research from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, one-third of prime-age women (ages 25-54) with children under five telework, and both mothers and fathers with young children are more likely to work remotely than other adults. Meanwhile, Flex Index’s Q3 2025 “Flex Report” found that nearly half of Fortune 100 companies now require in-office work four to five days a week, and the Federal Reserve’s latest “Beige Book” notes that many firms are using RTO mandates to reduce headcount in place of formal layoffs. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that, as RTO mandates took effect this year, labor force participation among mothers of young children saw the steepest 6-month decline in over 40 years, dropping three percentage points between January and June 2025, according to data from the Care Board. As RTO mandates make it increasingly difficult for many mothers to remain in the workforce, companies should consider taking concrete steps to create more equitable workplaces for parents. As companies roll out company-wide RTO mandates, it’s critical that they recognize how these mandates can disproportionately impact working parents, especially mothers, who often rely on flexibility to balance caregiving responsibilities. Without flexible options, strict in-office requirements risk pushing talent out of the workforce or forcing parents to choose between prioritizing work and family. To counter this, companies should consider offering flexible work options to employees who would benefit most from them, such as working parents. According to FlexJobs’ report, 72% of working parents say flexible hours would better support them, and 65% believe remote or hybrid work would help them in their roles. FlexJobs author Kirsten Chorpenning describes flexible work as an “essential tool” that enables parents to stay in the workforce and grow in their careers, rather than stepping back due to inflexible demands. And as previously reported, in addition to more flexible workplace policies, interim executive and fractional leadership positions also offer working mothers the ability to work temporarily or part-time without having to forego leadership roles and career advancement. By embedding flexibility into workplaces, even within the framework of broader RTO plans, companies can reduce the negative impact those mandates can have on working parents and foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace that benefits everyone. After all, research shows that employees perform better when properly supported. As companies enforce RTO mandates, many working mothers are forced into difficult decisions between their families and their careers, and with rising childcare costs, many of those who don’t want to give up their careers are left with few options. Consequently, women who would have otherwise chosen to continue working are exiting the workforce to meet caregiving demands. According to Care.com’s “2025 Cost of Care Report,” the average cost of childcare (including nannies, daycares, and family care centers) now consumes 22% of household income, making the shift back to in-office work not just a logistical burden, but a financial one as well. FlexJobs’ findings reinforce this reality, with nearly half of U.S. professionals saying they would more likely stay in a role that offered employer-sponsored childcare. Providing subsidized childcare is another vital way for employers to support working parents, helping to reduce financial strains and potentially improve retention among working parents. In fact, Care.com’s report found that 79% of parents believe employers can reduce childcare expenses through subsidizing the cost of caregiving. Ultimately, when companies invest in employer-sponsored childcare, they’re more likely to foster a more equitable workforce as RTO mandates take effect. This in turn benefits employers, who see greater employee retention, morale and performance. Companies should also consider implementing active-listening strategies that encourage open dialogue between leadership and employees. This includes regular one-on-one meetings to better understand each employee’s individual needs and build stronger connections, as well as frequent surveys to gather feedback. These tactics can help leaders understand specific benefits their teams are seeking and may provide insight into the unique challenges their employees are facing and what can be done to support them so they can do their best work. Improving communication with work teams can also help companies avoid broad, one-size-fits-all approaches that rarely work for everyone. For example, as previously reported, remote work can sometimes hinder rather than help women’s careers, since women often receive higher pay raises and more mentorship opportunities when they are physically present with coworkers. Therefore, while remote work might benefit some working mothers, it could also limit a woman just entering the workforce by reducing opportunities for guidance and career development. This underscores the importance of listening to and communicating with employees and offering flexible solutions so that each employee can perform at their best. It enables employers to understand what is and isn’t working for each individual, rather than applying blanket approaches that can hinder productivity, such as company-wide RTO mandates. Prioritizing individual employee needs doesn’t only benefit employees, it improves business outcomes. According to Future Forward Institute’s report titled “The Competitive Advantage of the Win-Win Workplace,” companies that invest in employee-focused benefits and work environments tend to achieve higher profitability. Despite recent setbacks, the long-term trend of more working mothers joining the labor force remains strong. Per the Care Board’s data, labor force participation among mothers of young children has risen from 58.9% in 1989 to 68.2% in 2025, marking decades of progress in workplace inclusion and gender equity. If companies choose to support working mothers now, this backslide will simply be a temporary stumble rather than a longer lasting fall. By embracing responsive, flexible and supportive workplace practices, employers can help ensure that progress for all working parents continues to build rather than unravel.

DALLAS — A contractor for Amazon Logistics plans to lay off more than 200 workers at two facilities in North Texas, according to filings with the state. Accelore Group, which is contracted by Amazon Logistics for package delivery services, plans to cut 214 jobs at two Amazon Logistics facilities -- one in the 3700 block of San Jacinto Drive in Fort Worth and one in the 12800 block of Eastgate Drive in Mesquite -- by Nov. 1, according to a filing with the Texas Workforce Commission. The affected employees are primarily delivery associates, along with four dispatch managers, a fleet supervisor, an operations manager, a hiring manager and a helper, according to the filing. "All affected employees have been notified of their separation dates and that their separation from employment will be permanent," the letter, signed by Accelore Group CEO Akram Syed and filed with the Teas Workforce Commission, stated. An Amazon spokesperson said Accelore Group is exiting Amazon's delivery service partner program in which independent third-party groups, like Accelore Group, provide delivery drivers who deliver packages for Amazon. Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal, which first reported the news of Accelore Group's planned layoffs, report that the program launched in 2018 and seeks to help entrepreneurs start delivery businesses. "Accelore Group is exiting the Amazon Delivery Service Partner program. We're actively working to help connect affected employees with other Delivery Service Partners in the Dallas-Forth Worth region who are currently hiring," Amazon said in a statement. Accelore Group was founded in 2003 in the Dallas area, according to their website. Amazon also ended contracts with two Philadelphia-area delivery partners, leading to nearly 150 jobs being cut, as the Dallas Business Journal reported. Amazon has invested about $70 billion in Texas since 2019 and has 49 fulfillment centers, 33 delivery stations and 36 Whole Foods locations in the state, according to the DBJ. Amazon reportedly recently bought 120 acres of land in Terrell, which is about 30 miles east of Dallas, for "the development of an international distribution center."

Title: Trump administration proposes overhauling H-1B visa process for higher-paid workers
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-h1b-visa-fee-selection-high-paid-workers-tech-finance-rcna233260
Time Published: 2025-09-23T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time After announcing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, the Trump administration on Tuesday proposed overhauling the visa’s lottery selection process to prioritize higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign employees. The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers. The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21. The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade. The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random. The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once. The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and "incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.” It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.” The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields. The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S. If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said. Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data. The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months. If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research. Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said. Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies. “Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote. Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict. Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants. Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000. Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court. A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related. In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000. Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.

Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation Friday that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one-time fee, which does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals, takes effect immediately. The proclamation, called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. It’s set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. As with Trump’s tariffs announcement, the proclamation sparked a strong public response. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. Many said that the news came out of nowhere and warned that it could harm American innovation. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry, more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year, according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8% compared to 4.3% for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to the Department of Government Efficiency. Government bodies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. The fee represents a costly inconvenience for large technology companies, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms, the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such as Security Operating Centers, moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by Nov. 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core, this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth and national security. The immediate shock and reaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.
