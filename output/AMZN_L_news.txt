ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Tariffs have dominated the thoughts, discussions and decisions of business executives, investors and economists just about as soon as President Donald Trump took office. Hours after being sworn in on January 20, he announced his intention to start 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even though these tariffs were initially delayed a month, they took effect—and the world’s businesses knew Trump’s threats were solid. As much of the world prepares to begin paying new tariffs of at least 10% tomorrow, businesses have taken different steps to assess and control the impact on their businesses, revenues and sales. Klarna and StubHub were both planning to IPO, but decided to put their market debuts on hold due to ongoing volatility. Nintendo, already facing scrutiny for the higher-then-expected $449.99 price for its new Switch 2, decided to push back last Friday’s pre-order date for the game console, citing the need to better assess levies and market conditions. Volkswagen will add an “import fee” to cars sold in the U.S. starting later this month, the New York Times reports, and is holding off on imports while it figures out tariffs. Then there are companies and industries experts are confident can get through this period with few problems. Forbes’ Phoebe Liu writes Amazon is likely to do well, largely because it has the infrastructure already in place to shift pricing to consumers and sellers and deliver items quickly and efficiently. While Amazon’s prices are likely to take a hit, analysts told Liu, everyone else’s prices will experience the same, so Amazon will perform relatively well. The National Retail Federation also delivered a sanguine forecast for the industry, saying they expect no tariff-related changes to their annual forecast, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The retail group isn’t ignoring the impact of tariffs, and they acknowledge that consumer and business confidence may be dropping, but NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said it’s not time to count out the American consumer. As uncertainty persists, finance departments are looking to save their businesses money wherever possible. And even though fewer M&A transactions are going forward this year than predicted, some dealmaking is taking place. One area that’s often overlooked—and can be quite costly—is third-party service contracts. I talked to Nate Buniva, a partner at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe , about how not to lose money on contracts in a transaction. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. It’s spring break season and we’ll be taking next week off from Forbes CFO. We’ll be back on Tuesday, April 22. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Stocks rallied slightly Tuesday morning over a bit of optimism that Trump may be willing to cut tariff deals. He wrote on social media that he had a “great call” with South Korea’s Choi Sang-muk, and “China also wants to make a deal, badly.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on CNBC that he believes “we can end up with some good deals” if other companies come to the table. Regardless, Wall Street has not reacted well to the idea of tariffs. Since Trump’s announcement, the Nasdaq is down 8.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 7.8%, and the S&P 500 is down 8.3% Warnings are incoming from many economists and banks. JPMorgan Chase issued 60% odds of a recession, labeling Trump’s policies as the “largest tax increase” since 1968, which will “fall heavily on the US consumer.” Goldman Sachs increased their recession odds to 45% on Sunday, and cautioned that unless Trump capitulated, recession is their baseline economic forecast. UBS Investment Bank chief strategist Bhanu Baweja described the economic issue with tariffs as “a manmade problem, concentrated really around one man.” And if Trump were to change his mind, “suddenly the whole algebra changes.” Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov surveyed 50 top Wall Street investors, more than half of whom initially supported Trump’s policies, and found that their confidence in him is gone. Nearly three-quarters say his plan has been ineffective, and 54% of former supporters say he is failing. At the very least, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman, Trump’s tariffs are risking the U.S.’s reputation as a stable and predictable global partner for trade and investment—something that might be extremely difficult to get back in the years when Trump is out of office. Federal employees rally in support of their jobs last month outside a federal building in Chicago. Unemployment is climbing, according to figures from the Labor Department last week. In March, the U.S. added 228,000 non-farm jobs, more than economists’ estimates of 140,000. But unemployment was up to 4.2%, higher than the 4.1% forecasts. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a 60% increase in March layoffs, with more than 275,000 jobs eliminated last month. Nearly 80% of those cuts were in federal government jobs through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Last month’s numbers were the highest since Covid-19 pandemic-related cuts in spring 2020. Court orders have directed the federal government to rehire more than 26,000 of those terminated employees so far, but the government is continuing to appeal and most of the employees appear to be on paid administrative leave for the time being, CBS reports. However, Trump continuously touts his tariffs as a job creator: Companies will be drawn to start manufacturing products in the U.S. again, so they will build factories that will employ Americans. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that’s an inaccurate way to look at the situation. Manufacturing has always been alive and well in the U.S., and the industry is at record-high levels from a productivity standpoint. Many items that are not manufactured in the U.S. today are inexpensive or commodity products, which is keeping with the country’s development as technology improves. Even if lower-level manufacturing comes back to the U.S. as a result of tariffs, it takes years to plan, build and staff a factory, so changes are years away. A sign at a Capital One Café in Miami. The $35 billion merger of Capital One and Discover made it past the Justice Department’s antitrust review, bringing the deal closer to the finish line, according to multiple reports. When the deal was first announced in February 2024, many analysts questioned if it would go through. President Joe Biden’s administration halted several mergers for antitrust reasons, including JetBlue’s planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and Kroger’s planned purchase of Albertsons. The New York Times reports that in January, before Trump’s inauguration, Biden’s Justice Department had drafted an interim memo that outlined concerns that the Capital One-Discover tie-up could harm consumers. The merger is not a done deal yet. It still needs approval from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Analysts believe the Justice Department would be the most likely to object; the Times writes the Federal Reserve hasn’t denied a bank merger application since 2003. But if this goes through, it’s the first big financial deal that will have made it through the Trump Administration’s brand of scrutiny. Nate Buniva, partner at West Monroe. Every business has third-party contracts for services and IT platforms, which can often be forgotten during an M&A transaction. Nate Buinva, a partner at management and technology consulting firm West Monroe, is an expert at paying attention to these contracts—which he said can save 40% to 60% in a transaction if managed correctly. I talked to him about how to properly handle third-party contracts on both sides of an M&A deal. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Are there any types of contracts that tend to be overlooked more than others? Buniva: It’s a lot of work to read the T’s and C’s of these large enterprise agreements and understand what it can mean from a dollars and cents perspective. Often the contract piece does get overlooked or just not talked about. It’s like: This is what we spend on our ERP, this is what we spend on our collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams, but there’s not always that double click of: In this merger, do we have the right to terminate one agreement and get [the new entity] on the other, or are we going to be held with double cost? Reading through these legal documents is not the most exciting, and M&A transactions move quickly, too. You have to do the 80/20 rule, and get up to speed quickly on what you have, and make educated decisions to move forward. Is there anything that companies planning to be involved in an M&A transaction in the near future should consider when they get into contracts? Absolutely. You want to put in clauses that contemplate where you have the ability to scale the way you can structure your pricing in a tiered fashion, whereas volume goes up, you see a preferred discount on a per-unit level. Let’s say you currently only have 100 service requests right now, and you would do a tier that would take you up into the thousands. The reason you’re tiering it so high, when you do acquire a new company, you are already set up with your existing providers at a price point that says: I want you to honor this discount because I’m bringing you this extra volume. You don’t want to be in a position of doing that acquisition and you’re paying the 100-unit rate, but your volume’s 1,000. You can put in change-of-control language that says pricing or the terms need to be reevaluated if there is a change of control and you’re being sold off or absorbed. Even if you're not contemplating a transaction in the future, you never know what’s going to happen. You may as well put it in. More and more vendors are open to that because in general, yes, they may have to provide more discounted pricing, but they want the additional volume. What advice would you give to a CFO on either side of a transaction? It takes a dedicated team. My guidance is to make sure you’ve cleared people's bandwidth internally and do a review of your third-party agreements. I would also recommend they bring in an expert externally to look at this stuff and build an inventory. Oftentimes, your procurement, IT or finance orgs don’t necessarily have the subject matter expertise. Your legal team will know what contractual rights you’ll have, but they don’t know where the market is on what you can negotiate out of or what tools you can use. Every department has their own contracts. If you don’t have it, build a centralized database. You’re going to want to look at when does the contract end? How much are you spending? What’s the service? Do you have termination rights? As you contemplate the transaction, you need to start talking with the other entity about what they have and where there’s overlap, or if you're being sold off, what gaps will you have as a new entity where you need to now go stand up your own agreements. All of that takes a lot of time and runway, so the other piece of advice is do it ASAP. Where you don’t want to be—and this is when we’ve been called in the past—is at the end hour: Oh my gosh, we’re going to be a standalone company next month. We don’t have a Microsoft agreement. We can do that, but if it had been a more thoughtful journey, then you can get better pricing, terms, service levels, all of that stuff across all of your services. Oftentimes CFOs are focused on what’s the cost synergy, the headcount reduction or the opportunity to scale this business? But third-party spend is a huge component of that. Elon Musk, who is slashing government spending through DOGE, has spoken out against tariffs. Forbes’ John Hyatt examines how much Musk’s business empire has to lose through the new taxes levied by Trump. 20%-25%: Proportion of car parts Tesla imported last year from nations excluding Canada. About 40% of battery materials come from Chinese suppliers $68 million: Value of a Starlink contract canceled by Ontario Premier Doug Ford in response to Trump’s trade war. Starlink, a division of SpaceX, does business in more than 125 countries ‘Economic Armageddon’: How Dan Ives, global head of technology research for Wedbush Securities, described the tariffs’ impact on the automobile industry, including Tesla As DOGE rampages through the federal government, billions of dollars in grant money and contracts are being cut. Here are 10 things all federal contractors should do, both those who are seeing funding canceled and those who may yet be on the chopping block. Even though many CFOs and CIOs say they work well together as a unified team, there are often serious differences when it comes to ownership and ROI for tech investments, and that can lead to botched tech rollouts. Here are some tips to improve that relationship for maximum success. Last week, a CEO used profanity on a live interview with CNBC as he reacted to his company’s stock price falling after a poor earnings report and Trump’s tariff announcement. In the days since, this CEO has said the tariffs will actually help his company. Which company does he lead? A. BlackBerry B. Restoration Hardware C. Penguin Solutions D.

Title: Shopify's Toby Lütke doubles down on his hardcore 2025 messaging
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/shopify-toby-lutke-efficiency-mandatory-messaging-internal-memo-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke is going all in on hardcore tech messaging. In a memo to employees that he posted on X on Monday, Lütke wrote: "In a company growing 20-40% year over year, you must improve by at least that every year just to re-qualify." "This sounds daunting, but given the nature of the tools, this doesn't even sound terribly ambitious to me anymore," Lütke wrote, referring to artificial intelligence. The memo — titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation" — directed employees to ramp up their AI usage at the Canadian e-commerce firm. Lütke said using the technology is "now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify" and that AI usage would be gauged in performance and peer review questionnaires. He added that the expectations apply to himself and all executives as well. The CEO appears to be reversing his reputation as a founder who values work-life balance. Last month, in response to an X post that touted him as an example of balancing work and family, Lütke wrote: "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend. I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Lütke has since deleted most of his 2019 tweets, including one that said: "I've never worked through a night. The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so. I need 8ish hours of sleep a night. Same with everybody else, whether we admit it or not." In 2023, Lütke restricted Shopify employees from having side hustles, saying the company required their "unshared attention." The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The Shopify CEO's remarks reflect a broader cultural crackdown on Big Tech workers, who have enjoyed a work culture known for office perks, top-line pay, and job security, sometimes without grueling hours. Across the industry, free massages and football tables have been replaced with messaging around "efficiency" and "scrappiness and frugality." At tech giants like Amazon and TikTok, pandemic-era work-from-home luxuries have been replaced by strict return-to-office mandates. At nearly every company, layoffs have taken a wrecking ball to the industry and AI adoption has cut hiring, making job security a thing of the past. "We want to operate like the world's largest startup," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his RTO memo in September. "That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration." Workers who spoke to Business Insider said they are feeling the pressure to work longer hours, go beyond what is asked of them, be highly visible, and evaluate other options beyond full-time work.

Title: SSA reorg plan contemplates field office closures, contradicting public statements

Two people enter a Social Security Administration office in suburban Detroit. Jim West / UCG / Universal Images Group / Getty Images Stay Connected Erich Wagner and Natalie Alms Updated April 7 at 8:27 p.m. ET A draft plan for service delivery at the Social Security Administration includes “field office consolidation” as a goal for next year — even as the agency maintains publicly that it isn’t closing field offices. SSA posted Monday on X that it “is NOT permanently closing field offices. Only underutilized hearing office space has been closed and without permanently closing field offices.” But a plan circulating within the agency includes a goal to “further reduce footprint” in 2026 and beyond. The scope of the envisioned "consolidations" is unclear, though the document singles out field offices as on the chopping block next year. This comes after billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency posted information about nearly 50 field offices it was planning to shutter. SSA has said that news reports about plans to close field offices are incorrect. The draft plan, originally sent March 21 and obtained by Government Executive, is required by the Trump administration by April 14 as part of its push to gut the federal workforce and reorganize agencies. Asked for comment Monday, SSA spokeswoman Nicole Tiggemann wrote, "There is no validity to this claim." At the same time the agency is contemplating plans to shutter offices, it also is moving ahead with new identity proofing requirements expected to push more people to those offices. SSA is ending phone service for many of its benefits applications, as well as those looking to make changes to their direct deposit information, leaving them with online or in-person avenues to do so. Some regional leaders that oversee field offices still haven’t gotten guidance on implementing the changes, which are scheduled to take place next week, according to one current employee. SSA is also looking to shed thousands of employees. The March 21 document says that the agency plans to cut 5,500 employees by the end of the fiscal year as part of the agency’s plan to get down to 50,000 employees, as Government Executive previously reported. Martin O’Malley, who served as Social Security commissioner during the final year of President Biden’s term, said that several elements of the plan, including further consolidations of the agency’s phone systems under Amazon Web Services and the development of a “digital service index” that elucidates which agency services can be conducted by phone, online or in-person, were already under discussion during his tenure. But none of it can be effectively done while reducing staff at the agency, which is already at a half-century low. “Except for the butchering of an agency that has already been reduced to a 50-year low in staffing, many of these things were things we had put into motion during my team, and some of it reflects the good work of the Office of Transformation ... A lot of those things should happen, but none will make up for the gutting the staff at this already depleted agency with a chainsaw,” he said. One operations component that formerly had about 400 feds now has only half that number, one current SSA employee told Government Executive. The office, a recent creation of what used to be two components, handles both operations support as well as some technology functions. “With the Regional offices gutted… no one will be left to support field offices when they have difficulty,” said the employee. Rich Couture, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees’ SSA General Committee, said he was alarmed to see the plan mention a hiring freeze at the agency, when Trump’s hiring freeze executive order specifically exempted employees who work on the delivery of Social Security benefits. He also noted that the reassignment of employees from regional and headquarters offices to frontline work constitutes a brain drain, both from those back-of-house components and from the frontline workforce. “From the union’s perspective, it made no sense to offer buyouts and early retirement to experienced frontline staff just to turn around and fill those vacancies with people who have no frontline experience, who will need months of training and years of on-the-job experience to become proficient in these complex programs,” Couture said. “And in order to train them, you need to take staff off the frontline to do so. It was an easily avoidable problem.” Couture said he too has heard concerns from frontline workers about the potential impact of the regional office consolidations and reassignments on the support employees in field offices and hearings offices need to do their jobs. “A lot of these components have positions that don’t make sense to put in a field office or a hearing office–you wouldn’t put an HR staffer into one of these offices, because it makes sense to have these staffed regionally and centrally,” he said. “One of the big concerns I’ve heard from employees of late is: What happens if all of these HR personnel are reassigned or RIFed and there’s not enough people to do the job, and then I decide at a later date that I want to retire or need to take some action with my insurance? That hasn’t been fleshed out yet.” SSA intends to push people online, the plan notes, by expanding what the public can do online with SSA, as opposed to going to an office in person or calling. Recently, however, people looking to reach the agency online have seen system outages as a result of new anti-fraud checks at the agency. The agency has also warned staff in its Office of the Chief Information Officer — which handles the agency's tech and is being led by a DOGE associate — of coming layoffs, calling the office's work "not mission critical,” one SSA employee told Government Executive. The agency says that it wants to ramp up the use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle calls. It hopes to use technology more broadly “to serve our increasing customer base with fewer employees,” the plan notes, including by fully automating the processing of most retirement and Medicare claims. O’Malley said the combination of increased anti-fraud measures–for an agency whose error rate is already under 1%–and funneling more people into online and AI-powered service lanes will crush the public’s faith in the agency. “There are things we could do to improve the level of customer service and ease of transaction for citizens and customers, but eliminating half the staff of the IT department is not one of those things and closing field offices is not one of those things,” he said. “Shutting down portals that had worked, whether online or via phone, to drive more people into the field offices–those are the things that actually destroy and degrade customer service, that appear designed to sour the public against the agency by cramming them into field offices.” Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the plans surrounding Medicare claims.

Title: Trade deficits happen for good reasons — not only from unfair practices
URL: https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2025/04/05/trade-deficits-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-05T18:29:08Z

On April 2, the Trump administration announced a system of tariffs on imports into the United States. The executive order imposed 10% tariffs for imports from all countries (excluding Canada and Mexico, which remain subject to tariffs imposed over the last two months) which take effect April 5, with higher tariffs for countries with which the U.S. has the largest trade deficit, to begin April 9. This means that imports from the European Union will be tariffed at 20%, while imports from China will see tariffs of 34% (see here for the full list of tariff rates.) In the short run, these tariffs will lead to increased prices, particularly for household products, cars, construction materials and some food items. As an example, the U.S. imports the bulk of its jasmine rice from Thailand which will have a reciprocal tariff of 36%. The extent to which the 36% tariff will be borne by rice farmers in Thailand, importers, grocery stores or households depends on the relative price sensitivity of each of these groups, but economic consensus is that households will bear at least part of that cost through higher prices. Items from toothbrushes to cars to washing machines will be similarly affected. Changes in the relative price of some goods and an increase in economic uncertainty around the profitability of some lines of business will lead to changes in investment decisions by companies in the United States. Retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart will see margins tightened and will have decreased incentive to open new stores or expand existing retail locations. Auto manufacturers will delay production as they seek to understand the impact on their business from the changes in tariffs. One early example is Stellantis, the manufacturer of American auto brands Chrysler and Jeep, who announced on April 3 that it will pause production on some auto lines leading to temporary layoffs for 900 hourly U.S. workers. Delays in production and investment are likely to continue as uncertainty about the way that these policies will alter the U.S. economy are digested. These reductions in investment and production delays increase the near-term likelihood of a recession. If tariffs persist, they will change the composition of the U.S. economy. Tariffs increase the prices at which domestic producers of tariffed products can sell their goods. This increases potential profits in protected industries, leading to higher prices and often lower quality for manufactured goods. It also leads to shifts in the nature of goods produced in the economy. Previously profitable sectors of the economy will see decreased demand as prices rise which will lead to layoffs and a short-term increase in unemployment. If the tariffs continue, jobs will eventually migrate to more tariff-protected segments of the economy. This will lead to overall declines in growth however, as these tariff-protected regions of the economy grow because of the increased profits associated with tariffs as opposed to increases in the demand for their products. The executive order issued this week gives justification for the imposition of tariffs as “... a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption ...” However, the tariff rate imposed on our foreign trade partners seems to be proportional to the ratio of the U.S. trade deficit with that country divided by the total dollar value of goods imported from that country, with a minimum rate of 10%. As such, the policy enshrines the idea that if there is a trade deficit, it is because of unfair trade policies on the part of foreign counterparties. Yet this is largely not consistent with the nature of trade. Just as most households run a trade deficit with the grocery store (“importing” goods from the store in exchange for money), we choose to import goods from abroad because they can be produced more efficiently there and we would rather use our productive capacity to produce higher-margin goods and services. We do not produce significant amounts of jasmine rice in the U.S. because doing so would be expensive for us and we would rather use our land and labor to produce goods and services that allow us to profit from our unique productive abilities. Complicating the role of tariffs is the reality that one cannot decouple foreign demand for American-produced goods, which reduces the trade deficit, from foreign demand for American assets, which increases it. When a U.S. distributor of luxury Swiss watches pays $5 million for a shipment of timepieces, the Swiss manufacturer of those timepieces can choose what to do with that $5 million. They can use those dollars to purchase American-made goods, or they can use that money to purchase American assets like real estate, stocks, bonds or Treasury securities. If they choose to purchase assets, then there is an increase in the trade deficit, which measures differences in the value of the shipment of goods (as opposed to assets) across borders. As such, the size of the trade imbalance with a country is inextricably linked to the relative desirability of American assets. The attractiveness in recent decades of American assets, and foreigners’ willingness to purchase them, is an important driver of our trade balance. This foreign investment in the U.S. because of the desirability of American assets has allowed U.S. companies to hire additional workers, produce additional products, and offer dividends that would not otherwise have been possible. A cooling of trade between countries as a result of tariffs will reduce this source of capital. One open question is whether the tariff announcement this week represents a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy that will persist throughout President Trump’s term in office, or whether it is the opening offer in bilateral trade negotiations to be had with our trading partners over the coming weeks, as has happened with Canada and Mexico since Trump’s inauguration in January. Retaliatory tariffs from across the world is also a high likelihood. Either way, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of policy in recent months and the questions that remain about the current proposal run the real risk of decreasing short-term investment and hiring by American companies and the desirability of American assets to foreigners. These risks have increased the likelihood of both inflation and decreased growth in the near term.

Title: Why Big Tech Interviews Take So Long. Here’s How To Beat The Process

ByCheryl Robinson ByCheryl Robinson, Contributor. Long interview processes at major tech companies are leaving job seekers waiting weeks for a ... More response. If you’ve ever felt like the interview process at a major tech company drags on forever, you’re not imagining things. A new study from Career.io confirms what many job seekers have suspected: landing a role at a top tech firm often means surviving a long, winding hiring process with the worst offenders keeping you waiting for nearly a month. The study analyzed publicly available data from 14 major U.S. tech companies, ranking them based on how long it typically takes to move from interview to job offer. The results? Some of the biggest names in the business aren’t just giants in innovation—they’re giants in hiring delays, too. At Oracle, candidates often wait close to four weeks for a response—if they receive one at all. According to reviews on Glassdoor, some candidates said their interview process lasted up to two months. Apple isn’t far behind, with an average turnaround time of 22 days. Adobe and Salesforce also require candidates to buckle up for a wait exceeding three weeks. While hiring managers may aim for the perfect fit, they inadvertently drive top talent away. Studies show that 82% of candidates lose interest in a role if the interview process drags on too long. This growing phenomenon, known as interview fatigue, occurs when job seekers become mentally and emotionally exhausted from drawn-out hiring procedures, repetitive interview rounds and unclear timelines. According to insights from Titus Talent, companies risk losing strong candidates not because of poor fit but because of poor processes. Amanda Augustine, a certified career coach at Career.io, says there’s a reason hiring has become more prolonged in recent years. “The tech industry has intensified the interview process, largely due to heightened competition stemming from layoffs,” she explains. “Hiring managers in big tech now hold more leverage than ever, implementing more rigorous and lengthy interview processes to identify the ‘best fit’ among a broader pool of applicants.” That means multiple interview rounds, technical assessments, culture-fit evaluations and follow-up conversations—all before a decision is made. Not every tech company is stuck in the slow lane. According to the report, Uber has the fastest hiring process, averaging just 9.34 days from interview to offer. Amazon (10.11 days) and Netflix (14.23 days) follow close behind. There’s a reason for this efficiency: Uber and Amazon rely heavily on high-turnover frontline workers like drivers and warehouse staff, necessitating a streamlined process. But it’s not just about speed for the sake of speed. Netflix, for example, emphasizes cultural alignment during their process, with multiple interviews and a final “vibe check” to ensure a strong team fit. Augustine notes, “Both Uber and Amazon have a reputation for hiring with flexibility in their workforce. The speed of drivers’ and warehouse workers’ onboarding has resulted in an expedited interview process, highlighting the operational priorities within the tech sector.” Interview fatigue is rising as candidates endure multiple rounds and extended timelines in today’s ... More competitive job market. Lengthy interviews aren’t going away anytime soon, but job seekers can approach them more strategically. Augustine recommends three ways to manage the marathon process: Interviewing at big tech firms may require patience, resilience, and a plan B. But with the right mindset and a few smart moves, candidates can stay in control—even when the process drags on.

Title: Should We Talk About The Weather? Should We Talk About The Government?

Severe storms this week have caused tornadoes, high winds, and flooding across large parts of the country since Wednesday, killing a least seven people so far, with more storms expected in the Midwest and Southeast in the next few days. The wave of storms comes as the National Weather Service (NWS) is coping with huge job losses thanks to Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s war on government agencies, especially the ones that deal with climate change, which Trumpers consider a made-up “religious” belief that can be safely ignored. The current storms follow another heavy storm system in March that killed at least 39 in tornadoes, high winds, and wildfires. The weather service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has lost at least 2,000 workers between firings, layoffs of “provisional” employees, and people taking/being pushed to take buyouts, leading to about 20 percent fewer staff dealing with the same amount of weather, which the administration has been unable to cut. In addition to the staff cuts, NOAA will shut down a number of its research division’s websites because its contracts with web services providers have been cancelled, according to Bloomberg News (gift link). As a result, almost all external websites reliant on Amazon, Google and WordPress services are poised to vanish early Saturday morning in Washington, wiping the bulk of the unit’s work, which includes climate and environmental science research, from public view. Sure, that sounds bad, but you probably didn’t visit those sites anyway, so you won’t even notice they’re gone. You’d certainly notice if Wonkette were gone, so we need you to become a paid subscriber if you can! If you already are, you rock! Scientists have been warning that the mass firings will harm weather forecasting and endanger the public, especially as hurricane season approaches. Of course, it’s extremely difficult to prove any links between the staff cuts and potential loss of life due to extreme weather, which kills people no matter how good the forecasts are. But any loss of lead time in warning the public, especially in the case of tornadoes, will make it harder for people to take shelter. Already this week, the National Weather Service office in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that because of staffing shortages, it wouldn’t be able to send teams out to survey the damage from tornadoes that hit the area Wednesday, at least not until after currently forecast storms have cleared, probably near the end of this weekend. In the meantime, the office asked members of the public to send the office photos of storm damage. NWS Louisville meteorologist Brian Neudorff explained that such crowdsourced photos would help the office “evaluate the damage and it will allow us to plan on where we need to go once we have the available staff to survey.” Local TV station WAVE also very responsibly reported that the Weather Service announcement didn’t directly link the staffing issues to the mass shitcannings at NOAA, instead leaving the audience to put two and two together. The staffing cuts have also forced multiple NWS locations to cut weather balloon launches from twice daily to just one a day. Some locations will halt balloon launches altogether, presumably because some other launch site is close enough for diminished government work. Not huge cuts — yet — just reductions or suspensions of balloon launches at 11 sites so far, a tenth of those that had been in use. The NWS uses these weather balloons, until recently launched twice per day from 100 total locations, to gather temperature, wind, pressure and other data from the ground up to approximately 100,000 feet. The results are compiled along with data from satellites, radar stations, surface weather stations, buoys and aircraft to build weather models and forecasts that are public and freely available. Former NOAA weather data boffin Michael Morgan, now an atmospheric science professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the reduced data may not be critical just yet, but it will make a difference to forecasts’ overall accuracy and timeliness: “We’re going to lose data because of this staffing,” Morgan said in a press conference Monday. “And that loss of data then translates into less precise forecasts, more uncertainties in the forecast. “Does it mean every single forecast is going to be poor? No, but it does mean that the uncertainties in our forecast will grow over time.” Alan Sealls, the president-elect of the American Meteorological Society, offered a more striking metaphor, comparing losing some weather balloon data to knocking a few bolts here and there out of the steel frame for an office tower: “Nobody can say how many bolts you can leave out or remove before the structural integrity is compromised.” We hasten to point out that this is indeed just a metaphor, and not an accusation that weather balloons did 9/11. The tragic thing here is that improvements in weather forecasting have led to significantly fewer deaths from extreme weather in the US and around the world. That’s primarily because forecasters have been able to give the public greater lead time in warning of conditions that will spawn tornadoes, as well as more accurate forecasts of the track of hurricanes, interventions by presidential Sharpie notwithstanding. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told CNN the staffing cuts will definitely lead to a decline in reliability of forecasts: “Any reduction in staffing at a weather forecast office will result in either delays in the forecast being issued, and watches and warnings as well, or an erosion of quality. […] It wouldn’t surprise me at all if at the end of the season we’ve gone back by a few years – maybe a decade – in terms of capability.” Spinrad led NOAA during the Biden administration, however, so we’re certain that the seasoned science experts on Twitter will explain that forecasts were good enough a decade ago, and that government scientists have only themselves to blame for losing their jobs because they kept saying climate change was real, even though that’s now illegal, and besides, now that Florida is preparing to outlaw “weather manipulation,” the number of deadly storms will definitely go down, so there. Yes, kids, we’re now going to enter a new age of stupid online arguments. It’ll be a bit like climate change. We know a warmer atmosphere is causing more extreme weather events, but it remains hard to attribute any particular storm’s effects to a warming climate. In some cases, like the heavier rainfall, greater storm surge, and rapid increase in severity of hurricanes in recent years, the connections are quite clear: Warmer air can hold far more moisture, warmer water expands, and higher ocean temperatures provide hurricanes a lot more energy to grow quickly. But tornadoes are such short-lived events, dependent on lots of variables, that the exact connections are still difficult to determine. Similarly, as Spinrad and others make clear, staffing cuts in the NWS will enshittify forecasts overall, and it’s only logical to expect crappier forecasts will leave the public with less ability to prepare for or escape storms. But unless reduced staff causes some really glaring bit of information to go missing, it’ll be very hard to connect the job cuts to particular storm losses. We forecast dangerous levels of gaslighting on all this. Share [AP / PBS Newshour / CNN / WAVE-TV / Inside Climate News / Bloomberg (gift link)] Yr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tariff ‘Liberation Day’ Sinks Stocks As China Retaliates

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump’s tariff “Liberation Day” turned into a Wall Street bloodbath. The tariffs on nearly all foreign nations are widely expected to raise prices for American consumers. And despite the White House’s insistence that they would not cause “pain,” investors are already feeling it. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, and the Nasdaq cratered 6%—their steepest daily percentage losses since 2020. The “Magnificent Seven” tech companies that drove much of the gains in recent years were the biggest losers from the tariff losses, but retail also struggled, as many firms manufacture their goods abroad. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Wall Street is souring on President Donald Trump. A new Forbes survey of 50 Wall Street bigs shows that many who supported the Trump campaign’s economic promises before he took office have abandoned him, with a vast majority now disapproving of the president’s economic policies. More than half of our respondents supported Trump’s economic plan as he reentered the White House in January, but 72% now say the Trump team’s economic plan has been ineffective. China will impose an additional 34% import duty on all U.S. goods starting next week, in retaliation against President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 34% “reciprocal tariff” on Chinese goods, the state media announced on Friday. All three major futures indexes nosedived sharply after the Chinese announcement, with Dow Futures falling nearly 2.9%, the benchmark S&P 500 dropping nearly 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq futures down 3.1%. Small business owners looking to borrow money from lending institutions may have to answer a new question: How will President Donald Trump’s tariffs affect their business? And while some companies may benefit long-term if manufacturing returns to the U.S., many will suffer in the interim because they can’t fully pass on increased costs to customers. The DOGE cuts made what would have otherwise been a “fairly quiet” March for layoffs the worst since spring 2020, a new report found. Employers shed more than 275,000 positions last month, and the first three months of the year saw the most quarterly jobs cut since Q1 in 2009, during the Great Recession. RH Chairman and CEO Gary Friedman Thursday’s tariff-induced stock market losses wiped almost $300 billion from the fortunes of the world’s billionaires, and some of the biggest losers are those who’ve tried to make recent in-roads with Trump. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg saw his wealth fall by $17.9 billion since Wednesday’s market close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who was $16 billion poorer on Thursday. In percentage terms, the biggest billionaire loser of the trade war was Gary Friedman, the CEO of retailer RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, whose fortune tanked from $1.2 billion on Tuesday to an estimated $750 million Thursday, a drop of 39%. About an hour into the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday, Friedman was heard reacting as shares fell 26% in after-hours trading: “Oh sh*t,” he said. MORE: Meanwhile, the day’s biggest winner was Latin America’s richest person, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, who got $2.1 billion richer as of Thursday afternoon. Mexico was not subject to additional tariffs in Trump’s announcement. Plaid CEO Zach Perret After its latest $575 million fundraise, Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is valued at $6.1 billion—less than half the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. Still, the fintech market has gotten a recent boost following a downward trajectory that began in 2022, with fintechs raising roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally in the first quarter of 2025, according to CB Insights. Illustration by Fernando Capeto for Forbes; Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images and Justin Sullivan/Getty Images There’s a long, storied list of famous auto industry flops, from stinkers like Ford’s Edsel and exploding Pinto to General Motors’s unsightly Pontiac Aztek crossover SUV. Elon Musk’s pet project, the dumpster-driving Tesla Cybertruck, now tops it. After a little over a year at market, sales of the 6,600-pound vehicle, priced from $82,000, are laughably below what Musk predicted. Its lousy reputation for quality—with eight recalls in the past 13 months—and polarizing look made it a punchline for comedians. Unlike past auto flops that just looked ridiculous or sold badly, Musk’s truck is also a focal point for global Tesla protests spurred by the billionaire’s job-slashing DOGE role and MAGA politics. Judged solely on sales, Musk’s Cybertruck is actually doing a lot worse than Edsel, a name that’s become synonymous with a disastrous product misfire. Ford hoped to sell 200,000 Edsels a year when it hit the market in 1958, but managed just 63,000. Sales plunged in 1959 and the brand was dumped in 1960. Musk predicted that Cybertruck might see 250,000 annual sales. Tesla sold just under 40,000 in 2024, its first full year. There’s no sign that volume is rising this year, with sales trending lower in January and February, according to Cox Automotive. WHY IT MATTERS “Musk’s miscalculation of what pickup truck buyers want was a costly one, as Tesla likely invested an estimated $900 million to develop Cybertruck,” says Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. “The fact that those costs can’t be shared with other Tesla vehicles compounds the problem. Tesla’s billionaire CEO once bragged that he does ‘no market research whatsoever.’ In retrospect, he might want to start.” MORE Things Are Bad At Tesla. They’re About To Get Much Worse. President Donald Trump’s tariffs will likely increase prices for a number of goods, from new cars to coffee and iPhones. The tariffs include a baseline 10% rate, with some trading partners facing higher taxes: $2,300: The potential price tag of an iPhone 16 Pro Max, assuming a 43% price increase for the devices as predicted by analysts from Rosenblatt Securities to offset the cost of tariffs 80%: The share of coffee beans imported into the U.S. that come from Latin America, where top producers face 10% tariffs 20%: The tariff that wine produced across European Union nations will face, with France and Italy being the U.S.’s top suppliers in 2021 The stock market’s recent losses are a reminder that your stock portfolio is a long-term asset. While it’s okay to pick individual stocks for a small share of your investments (think 10%), the rest should be in a fund. The most important consideration when evaluating a stock ETF is that it should be big and cheap, so your savings don’t get eroded by annual fees—but it’s also important to look at factors like taxes. President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs target more than 180 nations, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands, considered to be one of the wildest and most remote places on Earth. The islands are territory of which country? A. The United Kingdom B. Australia C. Denmark D. France Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Stocks may extend their post-tariff sell-off Friday after China retaliated with its own 34% duties on all U.S. goods, restrictions on rare earth exports, and other measures. Futures linked to the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are all pointing to a lower open. The Magnificent 7 stocks extend their slide on Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA+4.60%) plunging 3.6% and Apple (AAPL+4.77%) dropping 4.8% in premarket trading as of 8:50 a.m. EDT. Declines were 5.4% for Meta (META+0.26%), 6.2% for Amazon (AMZN+1.00%), 5.1% for Tesla (TSLA+5.16%), 1.6% for Microsoft (MSFT+3.09%), and 2.7% for Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL+1.02%). Shoe and garment makers extended their sell-off as they face tariffs on their Asian-made products. Nike (NKE+0.84%) fell 5% before the bell, Lululemon (LULU-0.39%) slid 5%, and Uggs-maker Deckers (DECK+0.05%) declined 4.4%. Energy companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM-0.91%), Chevron (CVX+0.04%), and ConocoPhillips (COP+0.92%) declined on recession fears. Equities markets had their worst day in five years Thursday as the S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,679.39 points, or 4%. Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump showed no signs of backing down on his plans to impose tariffs that are more severe than expected.“It’s going very well,” he said, comparing the imposition of tariffs with surgery and claiming “the markets are going to boom” along with the country. Friday, a government report showed that the U.S. labor market held up better than expected in March despite the federal government’s layoffs, the crackdown on immigrants, and surveys showing that consumers and businesses are increasingly anxious about the economy. Employers added 228,000 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising from a downwardly revised 117,000 in February and beating the average estimate of 130,00. The jobless rate nonetheless increased to 4.2% from 4.1%, and hourly wages increased 0.30%, both matching projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook at 11:25 a.m. EDT. Other central bank speakers include Michael Barr — who will talk about AI and banking — and Christopher Waller. Some stocks to watch today: Blackstone’s (BX+0.30%) stocks slid 4.4% in premarket trading. The investment company is considering selling two AirTrunk data centers in Australia for about A$2 billion ($1.3 billion) each to fund the Australian unit’s growth, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar. Constellation Brands (STZ+2.09%), which makes, imports, and distributes alcoholic beverages, reported sales and per-share profit that were slightly higher than the average analyst estimates on FactSet. The stock fell 2.1% in premarket trading. Exxon stock fell 2.6% before the open. The energy giant may report a $2.7 billion gain in profit in the first quarter from the prior three months, with fuel manufacturing the largest contributing factor, Bloomberg reported, citing a company filing. Guess (GES+1.15%) stock dropped 5.6% in premarket trading after plunging 11.8% on Thursday. The garment maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales and per-share profit that exceeded analyst expectations. The company’s guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue also topped consensus.

Title: Washington Post Opinions section anxiously awaits new leader after Jeff Bezos pushed David Shipley out

Former Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron joined MediaBuzz to discuss why he is disgusted with Bezos new mandate and why the move has garnered backlash at the publication. The Washington Post has faced an exodus of talent in recent months and remaining staffers, particularly in the Opinions section, are on pins and needles waiting to see where the "Democracy Dies in Darkness" paper is heading. Billionaire owner Jeff Bezos has routinely irked current and former employees since he famously stopped the editorial page from endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, prompting several staffers to leave the paper. His latest high-profile decision pushed Opinions section editor David Shipley out the door and put the unit in limbo until a replacement is named, a staffer told Fox News Digital. Discouraged Post employees feel it’s not the best time to work in the paper’s Opinions section and aren’t sure if Bezos’ relationship with President Donald Trump will impact who replaces Shipley. Staffers also feel that things haven’t been quite the same since the sudden 2021 death of treasured editorial page editor Fredd Hiatt. At the time, Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote that Hiatt’s unexpected passing marked the end of "a period of remarkable stability at the top of The Washington Post’s masthead."

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images; SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) "Remarkable stability" is certainly not a term that Post’s staffers would use to describe their place of employment nowadays. Hiatt, who predated Bezos’ takeover of the paper, was eventually replaced by Shipley after a months-long process that saw the paper’s Opinions section go leaderless for the first half of 2022. Opinions section staffers are currently frustrated that they worked through a long interregnum only three years ago, and now they’re doing that again. Bezos announced in February that Shipley had decided to step away when the Amazon founder pushed for major changes to the Post’s Opinions section. "We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others," Bezos wrote on X, announcing the decision. Bezos said Shipley was offered the opportunity to continue to lead the opinion section and declined. Now, Opinions section employees are aware that it takes quite a while to solicit applicants and conduct interviews for such a high-profile position and staffers are concerned that they’ll either be without a leader for another extended period, or that rushing the process will result in yet another transition in the near future if the hire isn’t up to the task. Following Bezos’ decision not to endorse Harris, 11 Post opinion columnists wrote a statement calling the decision a "terrible mistake." The decision also irked liberal staffers and readers alike, but Bezos has repeatedly defended the decision. BEZOS DEFENDS WAPO ENDING PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENTS AS THE 'RIGHT' CHOICE: 'I'M VERY PROUD OF THE DECISION' Washington Post Opinion section editor David Shipley stepped down in February. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Eyebrows inside the Post were raised even further since Election Day, as Bezos visited Mar-a-Lago and attended Trump’s inauguration, indicating their once-frosty relationship has healed for the moment. Trump claimed in a recent interview with OutKick's Clay Travis that Bezos disparaged some of his own newspaper's staffers as "crazy people." Longtime Washington Post reporter Paul Farhi left the paper in 2023 but keeps a close eye on his former employer and believes morale issues loom large. "There’s great disappointment in Bezos and widespread suspicion and concern about his relationship with Trump," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Still unclear how Bezos’ remaking of the editorial pages is going to play out -- not sure it will be more pro-Trump, although that is also the prevailing suspicion," Farhi added. "My sense is that morale continues to be terrible." A Washington Post spokesperson declined comment on "personnel updates," but noted a series of recent accolades the Opinions section has achieved, including the inaugural Goldsmith Prize for Explanatory Reporting.

(SAUL LOEB/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) While the Opinions section waits for a new leader, other departments have also hemorrhaged both money and talent. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Post "lost around $100 million" in 2024 as subscriptions and ad-revenue plummeting took a toll on the paper. The paper has also seen layoffs and top journalists, including Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Pager, Hannah Allam, and Matea Gold have all left. Longtime liberal columnist Eugene Robinson also left the paper on Thursday, marking the latest high-profile exit. Another liberal columnist, Jennifer Rubin, fled the Post earlier this year in protest of Bezos. TRUMP APPLAUDS JEFF BEZOS’ CHANGES AT WASHINGTON POST IN RARE MEDIA PRAISE The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the paper after her bosses rejected her illustration depicting Bezos groveling to Trump. Opinion columnist Ruth Marcus recently announced she was leaving the paper after a 40-year stint, citing Bezos' plans to reshape the Opinions section. Marcus said Bezos and other tech tycoons who attended the inauguration were akin to being Trump’s "trophies."

(Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Pool via REUTERS) "His presence on the inaugural platform conveyed a message of support for Trump that, I can say now, was inappropriate," Marcus wrote in the New Yorker. Farhi said the "bright side" is that the news side of the Post has "been doing superb reporting" on Trump and DOGE leader Elon Musk’s efforts to crack down on government spending. Farhi has noticed that Bezos and CEO Will Lewis have refrained from "meddling" in straight-news coverage and that Trump hasn’t been criticizing the paper on social media, which was a common practice during his first administration. "It’s possible Bezos has come to some kind of truce with Trump, but at great cost to his integrity and to the integrity of the Post," Farhi said.
