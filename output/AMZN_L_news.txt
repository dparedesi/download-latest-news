Title: Verizon Begins Laying Off Thousands of Workers

Reading time 2 minutes Telecom giant Verizon has begun laying off some 13,000 employees as part of a new reorganization initiative. Approximately a week ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering job cuts. Now, the layoffs have begun, according to an email viewed by Gizmodo. âOur current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,â wrote Verizon’s new-ish CEO, Dan Schulma, in an email sent Thursday and shared with Gizmodo (the Journal originally reported on the email). âWe must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,â the top executive added. Yes, to “delight” customers, the company must apparently very much not delight its workforce. Schulman, who took over the top spot in October, said in the email that the layoffs would reduce Verizon’s “outsourced and outside labor expenses.” To help the workers who are losing their jobs, Verizon has established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund, Schulman said. This fund will “focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps,” he shared. The CEO added that technological change was sweeping through the economy.Â “Changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries,” he wrote. “Change is necessary, but it can be difficultâespecially when it affects valued teammates. Itâs important that we direct our energy and resources to set Verizon on a path to success. The actions weâre taking are designed to make us faster and more focused, positioning our company to deliver for our customers while continuing to capture new growth opportunities.” When it comes to job security, this has been a tough year for tech workers. Amazon recently announced 14,000 layoffs, Accenture and Synopsis have announced thousands of layoffs, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle have made similarly dour announcements, and Intel has promised to reduce its workforce by a whopping 25,000. There are many other tech companies that have made similar moves over the last twelve months. Yes, lots and lots of people are getting fired right now, and, according to reports, it’s increasingly difficult for entry-level workers to find positions. Some people blame AI (which is promising to help America’s C-suite gut certain segments of their corporate workforce) while others merely blame our shitty economy, which seems to be suffering under the yoke of the Trump administration’s dopy fiscal policies. There’s no reason why both can’t be to blame. Whatever the cause, one thing is clear: Silicon Valley is in its downsizing era, and it’s not so much fun.

Title: Google offers voluntary buyouts to UK employees

Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is offering voluntary buyouts for employees in its UK offices, Business Insider has learned. An email went out to UK staff this week offering them a voluntary exit package, according to two people familiar with the matter and confirmed by a Google spokesperson. It's unclear which UK organizations the offers went to, or how many buyouts were offered. Google did not respond when asked for comment about this. "Earlier this year, some of our US teams introduced a voluntary exit programme with severance for U.S.-based Googlers, and we are now also offering the programme in the UK to support our important work ahead," the Google spokesperson said. "We are committed to investment in the UK and continue to hire for critical roles and important projects aligned with our company priorities to ensure we can deliver on the opportunity that AI offers the UK economy," they added. The voluntary buyouts are the latest example of Big Tech firms finding ways to reduce head count this year to become more efficient, flatten management structures, and lean into AI. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have announced layoffs, while Microsoft has also offered some employees money to leave. The exact package being offered by Google in the UK would depend on how long the employee had worked at the company, staff were told. Google employs more than 7,000 people in the UK, according to its own figures. Google has offered voluntary buyouts across various parts of its US business this year, including its Android and Core engineering orgs. Much of the framing of these has been about how Google is reorienting its company around AI, and that it wants employees who aren't excited about that goal to feel like they can leave. In October, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan offered employees a voluntary exit package as part of a reorganization around AI priorities, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. "It's an incredibly exciting time at YouTube and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead. But we also understand some of you may be ready for a new challenge, so we've decided now is the right time to offer a Voluntary Exit Program," Mohan wrote. Have something to share?

Title: U.S. stocks rise on a wave of fresh optimism led by Nvidia and Walmart

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time What began as a banner day for stocks turned into a major rout, as investors signaled ongoing skepticism about the longevity of the artificial intelligence boom and trimmed hopes of support from the Federal Reserve. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, and the broad S&P 500 index dropped by more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 top-tier stocks, declined by nearly 390 points. It had been up 700 points earlier in the day. Cryptocurrencies also shed billions in value: Bitcoin had fallen below $87,000 as of late Thursday afternoon, weeks after having set highs above $120,000. The stunning turnaround added further unease to an already shaky economy that has forced households to trim budgets amid stubborn inflation and signs of a wavering job market. With an ever-increasing part of the economy's principal driver — consumer spending — now reliant on affluent households, an extended market pullback could inflict wider damage. "You don’t have to have the biggest bubble in history for an expensive stock market" and end up seeing declines, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak asset management group. Traders’ hopes were boosted early Thursday by a better-than-expected jobs report that appeared to show the economy remained resilient. Even before the day began, stocks looked poised to rise after Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Yet by midday, markets had turned red. The solid September jobs report diminished the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month to lower the cost of borrowing money to spur economic activity. When investors don't have to pay as much in interest, they often put those savings into stocks. “The broad rebound in payrolls suggests diminished risks of a higher unemployment rate,” analysts with Morgan Stanley said in a note published shortly before noon. “We no longer expect a Fed cut in December.” Losses were further compounded by ongoing concerns about AI — specifically, how much more profitable the companies buying chips like Nvidia's will be. The fears were articulated Wednesday evening on X by Michael Burry, made famous by the movie "The Big Short." "Just because something is used does not mean it is profitable," he wrote. Finally, the ongoing sell-off of bitcoin indicated to some traders that a key source of support for stocks — retail or day traders — were beginning to waver on their trademark "buy the dip" mentality. "I wouldn’t say we’ve flipped from bull to bear," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group. "I would say we’ve flipped from bull to balanced market in the short term. A lot depends on whether sentiment continues to weaken." Stocks had already been showing signs of flagging in recent weeks. With Thursday's losses, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest point since September. The long-delayed September jobs report, which showed that the United States added a sturdy 119,000 jobs, appeared to show some glimmers of hope for the economy. Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% in August to 4.4%, about 450,000 workers entered the labor force. Economists view that as evidence that job opportunities are still plentiful, despite a wave of corporate layoffs. Just before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the jobs report, Verizon told employees it planned to lay off 13,000 employees, or about 13% of its workforce. The company joined a suite of other blue-chip employers that say they plan to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, including Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS. The details of the jobs report, which captured conditions before the government shutdown, as well more recent jobs data, suggested a more mixed picture for the U.S. economy. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. Wage growth slowed, and job totals for July and August were revised downward. The employment gains in September were concentrated in the health care, hospitality and social assistance sectors. Another snapshot of the economy came courtesy of Walmart, which on Thursday reported strong sales and raised its outlook for the year. That strength points to cracks in the economy, though. Executives said the chain is luring more high-income shoppers who are looking for bargains, and noted that lower-income families are feeling more pressure. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on an earnings call Thursday morning. Walmart's stock closed 6.5% higher. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. UPDATE: Verizon is set to lay off over 13,000 workers in the coming weeks as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring initiative. "Today, we will begin reducing our workforce by more than 13,000 employees across the organization, and significantly reduce our outsourced and other outside labor expenses," newly appointed CEO Dan Schulman writes in a memo to employees that it also published online. "Every part of the company will experience some level of change." Verizon had just over 100,000 employees as of Sept. 30, meaning the layoff will reduce the headcount by 13%. Schulman says that the company's current costs and structure limit its ability to invest in its "customer value proposition." He also argues that complexity and friction within the organization were slowing it down and frustrating customers. In the last quarter alone, the company lost 7,000 postpaid customers, while rivals T-Mobile and AT&T made significant gains. Verizon says it set up a $20 million fund focused on "skill development, digital training, and job placement" for the people it's laying off. It touted the fact that it's "the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI," which is...an interesting way to spin things. Those impacted in the US will be notified today, while those in other regions will be notified in the coming weeks, The Wall Street Journal reports. Original Story (11/14): Verizon could soon be the latest tech company to announce a mass layoff. The carrier will cut around 15,000 jobs next week, The Wall Street Journal reports. The news arrives amid stiff competition for Verizon; it lost 7,000 postpaid customers in the last quarter, while T-Mobile added 1 million and AT&T gained 405,000. The report also arrives just over a month after Dan Schulman was appointed as the new CEO. The former PayPal CEO had served on Verizon's board for seven years before taking over as the chief executive in early October. "Verizon is at a critical juncture," Schulman said at the time. "We are going to maximize our value propositions, reduce our cost to serve, and optimize our capital allocation to delight our customers, and deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders." Verizon had about 100,000 employees in February, and cutting 15,000 would mark the largest job reduction in the company's history, according to WSJ. While most of the job cuts will come through layoffs, others will result from franchising stores. Around 180–200 stores will be franchised, meaning people working there will no longer be on Verizon's payroll. With the move, Verizon joins the long list of tech companies trimming their workforces significantly this year. Intel announced a reduction of 15% of its workforce in July, and Amazon just cut 14,000 jobs last month. While expense management and restructuring have been cited as reasons by Verizon and Intel, Amazon has pinned the blame on employee culture. Jibin is a tech news writer based out of Ahmedabad, India.

Title: US filings for jobless benefits remained in historically healthy range during government shutdown

Time Published: 2025-11-20T14:56:33Z

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer New U.S. jobless claim applications fell last week, remaining within the healthy range of recent years, according to the government’s first weekly layoffs data since before the government shut down on Oct. 1. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 fell by 8,000 from the previous week to 220,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Data for the weeks covering the government shutdown also remained in the same range of recent years, falling between 200,000 and 250,000. Also Thursday, the Labor Department said in a separate report that U.S. employers added a surprisingly solid 119,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest since October 2021, however that’s partly because 470,000 people entered the labor market. The increase in September payrolls was more than double the 50,000 economists had forecast. But Labor Department revisions shaved 33,000 jobs off July and August payrolls. The monthly jobs report — considered the most important market-moving data on the U.S. employment situation — had been delayed for seven weeks by the federal government shutdown. During the 43-day shutdown, investors, businesses, policymakers and the Federal Reserve were without much of the figures they use to diagnose the health of the American job market because federal workers had been furloughed and couldn’t collect the data. Thursday’s labor market reports come at a time of considerable uncertainty about the economy. The job market has been strained by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump’s erratic tariff policies, though economic growth at midyear was resilient. Fed policymakers are divided over whether to cut interest rates for the third time this year when they meet in December for the final time this year. Some major companies have announced job cuts this year, including Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent company Meta. Intel and The Walt Disney Co. also recently announced staff reductions, as have Verizon, General Motors,American Airlines and Amazon. Thursday’s report on weekly layoffs showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 3,000 to 224,250. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 8 jumped to 1.97 million, an increase of 28,000 from the previous week.

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Verizon is laying off more than 13,000 employees in mass job reductions that arrive as the telecommunications giant says it must “reorient” its entire company. The job cuts began on Thursday, per to a staff memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman. In the letter, which was seen by The Associated Press, Schulman said Verizon’s current cost structure “limits” the company’s ability to invest — pointing particularly to customer experiences. “We must reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,” Schulman wrote. He added that the company needed to simplify its operations “to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers.” Verizon had nearly 100,000 full-time employees as of the end of last year, according to securities filings. A spokesperson confirmed that the layoffs announced Thursday account for about 20% of the company’s management workforce, which isn’t unionized. Verizon has faced rising competition in both the wireless phone and home internet space — particularly from AT&T, T-Mobile and other big market players. New leadership at the company has stressed the need to right the company’s direction. Schulman became CEO just last month. In the company’s most recent earnings, he stated that Verizon’s trajectory was at a “critical inflection point” — and said, rather than incremental changes, Verizon would “aggressively transform” its operations. For its third quarter of 2025, Verizon posted earnings of $4.95 billion and $33.82 billion in revenue. The carrier reported continued subscriber growth for its prepaid wireless services, but it lost a net 7,000 postpaid connections. News of coming layoffs at Verizon was reported last week by The Wall Street Journal. The outlet says that the 13,000 job cuts mark the largest-ever round of layoffs at the company. Beyond the cuts across Verizon’s workforce, Schulman said that the New York company would also “significantly reduce” its outsourced and other outside labor expenses. It’s a tough time for the job market overall — and Verizon isn’t the only company to announce sizeable workforce reductions recently. More and more layoffs have piled up at companies like Amazon, UPS, Nestlé and more. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Regardless, such cuts have raised worker anxieties across sectors. Schulman on Thursday recognized that “changes in technology and in the economy are impacting the workforce across all industries.” He said that Verizon had established a $20 million “Reskilling and Career Transition Fund” for workers departing the company. Shares of Verizon fell just over 1% by Thursday’s close.

Title: Creator Economy Ad Spend Projected To Hit $37B This Year, IAB Report Says
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/iab-2025-creator-economy-ad-spend-report-1236623395/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T14:14:54Z

By Jesse Whittock International TV Co-Editor The creator economy ad market will hit $37B this year, growing at four times the rate of the overall media industry, according to a new report on the sector. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s 2025 Creator Economy Ad Spend & Strategy Report forecast the massive growth in the sector in the U.S. this year, up 26% year-over-year. The figures point to marketers and advertisers increasingly treat contenting creators as distinct channels, rather than elements of social media campaigns, the IAB report claimed. Related Stories News Digital Talent Rep Fixated Hires Content Chief To Fill "Massive Hole" In Creator Economy News YouTube Diehard Trevor Noah Envisions A "Creator-Run World" Where Talent, Brands And Audiences Connect In "Beautiful Verticals" Spend included in IAB’s report includes direct partnerships and their paid amplification, along with ‘content adjacencies,’ defined as brands investing “intentionally run ads adjacent to creators with whom they do not have a direct partnership.” For context on the 2025 figure, media as a sector overall grew 5.7%, per a separate IAB study from September. Further to that, you can see the rate of growth in that IAB noted the overall creator economy ad spend for 2021 was $13.9B, rising to $29.5B last year. IAB projects the 2026 figure will be $43.9B, up another 18%. Watch on Deadline “Leveraging the creator economy to connect with audiences is no longer experimental for marketers – it’s essential,” said David Cohen, CEO at the IAB. “The significant growth we’re seeing reflects a deepening commitment from brands to invest in creator-driven strategies. However, with that maturity comes a need for clear standards, better measurement, and tools to navigate an incredibly fragmented ecosystem.” The IAB itself has had to pivot due to the tilt toward creators. The organization puts on the annual NewFronts in New York, a series of showcases to ad buyers dominated by streaming. As traditional NewFronts companies like YouTube, Amazon, NBCUniversal and Hulu have fallen out or shifted toward the traditional broadcast and streaming upfronts in mid-May, the IAB has branched out to gaming and creator events. Breaking the 2025 stats down, the most ad spend came from retail ($12.3B), followed by consumer packaged goods, finance, apparel, tech, auto, telecoms, travel, home, health and wellness, and media and entertainment the only vertical below $1B at $400M. IAB’s report showed marketers were most keen to pact with content creators who were managed by social media platforms such as YouTube BrandConnect and TikTok Creator Marketplace, followed by creators managed by media companies such as web publishers and TV networks and then direct outreach. Creator-specific representation agencies, which have been springing up at a significant rate, was the sixth-most popular route. Working with talent agencies such as UTA and WME and sports rep agencies, including the sports units of the Big Three, were least favored. It’s also expected AI will take a central role in creator-led campaigns with 46% of respondents currently using it for content creation and work processes and another 29% planing to do so in the next year. The stats come as TV and film companies continue to wrestle with their relationship with the creator economy. With thousands out of work following huge layoffs at media and tech giants over recent years, there has been a growing acceptance of content creators and more professionals exploring how they can apply their expertise to the creator world. IAB’s U.S. Creator Economy reaches its stats through an ad spend projection that measures the ad dollars brands invest in creators through direct partnerships. Earlier this week, credit card provider Visa released a report projecting the creator economy would hit $500B by 2027. Dade Hayes contributed to this report.

Flipkart-backed UPI app super.money is preparing a fresh push into buy now, pay later (BNPL) by partnering regulated banks and lenders, as it hunts for its next leg of growth beyond credit on UPI, according to two people aware of the plans. The company is looking to compete with existing checkout-finance players such as Axio and Snapmint in the tightly contested intersection of e-commerce and lending, said the first person, asking not to be named as the product is still under development. “Once it is fully built, the launch will have two parts," this person added. “One is to offer super.money as a checkout option on e-commerce sites, and the other is to bring an e-commerce layer inside the app itself with BNPL-style financing at checkout." The second person said the broader idea is to position super.money as a one-stop destination for e-commerce journeys supported by credit, so that users can move from discovery to payment in a single, smooth flow on its interface. Mint could not independently ascertain a firm timeline for the launch. However, the two people cited above said the BNPL product is currently in development and testing, and is expected to go live only after the company completes tighter KYC and other regulatory checks that apply to this category. This emerging category, where BNPL is offered as a checkout option across commerce sites, is not new. Companies such as Snapmint, which raised about $125 million this year, and Axio, acquired by Amazon for around $200 million, are already significant players in this space. According to Brijesh Damodaran, managing partner at Auxano Capital, a BNPL offering allows a UPI app to move beyond being just another payments button at checkout granting it greater control over the merchant interface with features such as EMI options, offers, and seamless pay-later flows. “UPI has won on volume but not on margins. But it carries zero MDR (merchant discount rate) and is heavily commoditised. BNPL or checkout credit lets a UPI app move from pure payments to credit-led revenue through interest, fees, or merchant commission," he said. MDR is the fee merchants pay to payment processors for accepting digital payments; UPI transactions have had a zero MDR regime since 2020, meaning payment apps earn no direct revenue from flows. Within the broader consumer credit landscape, BNPL is expected to grow at a robust clip of 20–35% annually over the next several years, though the big question is whether large banks, traditional card issuers, or UPI-first players like super.money will end up controlling most of the market at checkout, Damodaran added. Business basicsA spokesperson for super.money declined to comment on the new BNPL plans. However, founder Prakash Sikaria told Mint that the app had processed “around ₹740 crore of loans" last month alone through its various credit products. Apart from loans, super.money also works with a clutch of banks, including Axis Bank (for a co-branded credit card and secured cards), Utkarsh Small Finance Bank (secured credit cards and fixed deposits) and Kotak811 (secured cards and an integrated savings–spending–borrowing account). “Next year, our projection is 2 million cards. We are already among the top three issuers of RuPay cards and we want to be the largest," Sikaria said. Flipkart launched super.money beta version in June 2024 and rolled it out publicly in August that year. Since then, the app has doubled down on young, often first-time borrowers as its core market. To acquire these users, super.money leaned on a rewards-led model that offers up to 5% cashback on every UPI transaction. The strategy appears to have paid off: by September 2025, the app had climbed into the top bracket of UPI players by transaction volume, overtaking established names such as CRED, Amazon Pay, WhatsApp Pay and BHIM.

In September, super.money processed 256.34 million UPI transactions worth ₹9,852.44 crore, even as PhonePe and Google Pay continued to command 80–83% of the overall market, down from about 85% a year earlier. On whether such heavy cashback-led acquisition is sustainable, Sikaria said the average annual cashback per user is roughly $2–3. “Our thesis is we just need to monetize $2–3 more per user than our competition," he said. “India has a wide diversity of users; typically, monetisable users subsidise non-monetisable ones. If you can largely avoid non-monetizable users and focus on a high-Arpu (average revenue per user) segment, your average Arpu is much higher." Elaborating on secured credit products, Sikaria said that super.money sees average monthly spends of about ₹5,000–6,000 per secured card user, largely led by merchant payments. The app now has roughly 10.0–10.5 million monthly transacting users. On the revenue side, Sikaria said super.money is making about $3 million a month, which works out to an annualized revenue run rate of around $36 million at present. Flipkart’s renewed fintech bet with super.money marks its second coming in payments and lending after its PhonePe chapter. The e-commerce major bought PhonePe in 2016, but the two separated ownership in December 2022, paving the way for both to raise capital and scale on their own, with Walmart continuing as the common majority shareholder. Since then, PhonePe, led by Sameer Nigam, has filed draft papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for an initial public offering of around ₹11,000 crore and seen large secondary share sales, including General Atlantic’s $600-million deal that helped employees cover tax outgo on exercised stock options. Regulatory lensThe BNPL segment has drawn scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in recent years, especially around low-ticket unsecured lending, deferred payment products routed via prepaid instruments, and opaque pricing for borrowers. The RBI has tightened norms on digital lending and pushed lenders to hold more capital against unsecured retail portfolios. In 2023, the RBI also tightened rules around first-loss default guarantees (FLDGs), a popular comfort structure used by fintechs with their NBFC partners, where the fintech promises to cover part of the lender’s credit losses. The central bank capped such guarantees at 5% of the outstanding loan pool, after earlier market practice in some unsecured digital lending segments had reportedly gone much higher. That pushed several lending service providers to pause or redesign short-duration, small-ticket credit products as their NBFC partners reworked risk, capital and economics under the new cap. The BNPL landscapeThe UPI and BNPL market has filled up with rivals such as Navi (founded by Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal), MobiKwik, Paytm, Amazon Pay and Google Pay. In BNPL specifically, super.money’s planned products would sit alongside Snapmint and Axio, as well as captive “pay later" offerings such as Amazon Pay Later and Flipkart Pay Later, plus horizontal BNPL specialists like Simpl and LazyPay (owned by PayU). Also Read | Why Manipal and upGrad want Byju’s—and what’s really at stake now The BNPL industry in India has witnessed turbulence over the last few years, especially after high-profile setbacks like the shuttering of ZestMoney. Once a poster child for digital lending, ZestMoney ceased operations in December 2023 amid mounting non-performing assets and regulatory pressure, before parts of its loan book and technology platform were sold to DMI Finance, an NBFC lender. Layoffs and restructuring followed, and similar pressures have also hit rivals. Simpl, another leading checkout credit provider, has reportedly trimmed its workforce in October this year and faced regulatory heat, including enforcement action from the Enforcement Directorate this year.

Title: In the Wake of the U.S. November Elections and the Reopening of Government? Food Insecurity, Worsening Economic and Social Crisis
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/elections-reopening-government-social-crisis-worsen/5906324
Time Published: 2025-11-20T12:29:54Z
Full Content:
On November 4, the electorate in several United States municipalities and gubernatorial races delivered a resounding rebuke to the current trajectory of the MAGA Republicans who control both Houses of Congress and the White House. The elections came just over two weeks after the second “No Kings Day” around the U.S. which mobilized an estimated 7 million people. Therefore, on electoral and mass levels people are expressing their disagreement and anger with policy imperatives of the current administration. During the months of October and early November, the U.S. Senate could not agree on a national budget to keep the federal government functioning. The major issue stalling an agreement was the threat on the part of the administration and its allies in Congress to not provide adequate funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was passed during the tenure of former President Barack Obama. Although the ACA has never been a viable substitute for a genuine national insurance program which would guarantee healthcare to all persons living in the country, the dissolution of what is labelled pejoratively as “Obamacare” absent of an alternative would of course prove disastrous. These cuts in healthcare funding, which delayed the reopening of the federal government for 43 days, resulted in the refusal of the administration to provide billions of dollars in Supplemental Nutrition Agriculture Program (SNAP) benefits to tens of millions of people. It would take a federal court decision demanding that the Trump administration pay out benefits to families which rely on these programs for a bare minimum of food to compel partial payments. Some states in the U.S. recognizing the potential for severe malnourishment, did release emergency funds to stave off a major food deficit crisis. . . Yet the crises are by no means resolved. Although the Republicans in the Senate pledged to reopen a debate on the extension of existing ACA subsidies, there is no methodology for holding them accountable. If the costs of healthcare premiums for ACA recipients increase substantially, it could very well portend the demise of the program since those within low-and-moderate income households would not be able to afford enrollments in this program. In addition to threats to the existence of the ACA, there is currently a bill under consideration in Congress which would place two-year limits, with some exceptions, on Section 8 housing subsidies. If these plans are carried out it would result in homelessness for millions more in the U.S. Consequently, the suspension of SNAP benefits, the overpricing for healthcare coverage and the severe curtailment of housing subsidies would inevitably result in the premature deaths of millions in the U.S. One commentator over the conservative Fox News network said on air that people who have no homes to live in should be given lethal injections by the government. These developments had a profound impact on mass mobilizations against Trump as well as the outcomes of the November 4 elections. The emerging crises requires an independent strategy to build a sustainable resistance movement to not only stop the ongoing attacks from the White House and Congress, the struggle must move to enhance the social safety net and improve the overall economic conditions for the workers, farmers and youth inside the U.S. One of the most watched elections during early November was the mayoral race in New York City, the largest municipality in the country. Zohran Mamdani won the election as a stated democratic socialist committed to lowering the cost of housing, public transportation and childcare. Mamdani emphasized that the municipality was a “city of immigrants” and therefore should not cooperate with efforts by the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents to hunt down and deport residents of New York. During the days leading up to the elections, ICE personnel attacked vendors on Canal Street in Manhattan who are there daily merely to make a living amid rising inflation. People in the neighborhood battled the federal agents demonstrating their opposition to the immigration policies of the White House. In other elections where Democratic candidates won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, undoubtedly were the voters’ response to the presence of ICE and the worsening economic situation facing working people. In California, a referendum to create five new Congressional districts was a direct response to the actions of the Texas state legislature to enhance the membership of the MAGA Republican representation in the House of Representatives. Los Angeles, the second largest municipality in the U.S., has been targeted by the Trump administration by deploying large units of ICE agents along with federalized National Guard troops and Marines. These efforts by Trump have not endeared people in California and other states to his domestic policies. In Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., the deployment of the National Guard was carried out absent any support for these actions by the people. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago have taken legal and political actions to prevent the sending of National Guard troops into the third-largest city in the country. On a daily basis people in Chicago and its suburbs have been challenging ICE in their raids on communities, workplaces and commercial businesses. Portland, Oregon, which is not a majority African American or Latin American municipality, has also been targeted in all likelihood for its progressive population which fought the deployment of federal agents during the George Floyd uprising of 2020. On a legal basis and through mass demonstrations, the people of Portland strongly objected to the sending of National Guard troops into the city. Although Trump declared that ICE, the Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) agents and the National Guard are being deployed to find, detain and deport migrants, in actuality his security personnel have stated that they are after “gangs” and drug traffickers. These agents are setting up checkpoints to monitor the populations as a whole. Despite the claim of economic prosperity over the last ten months, untold numbers of workers, farmers, agricultural employees, small and medium-sized businesses are suffering immensely due to the repressive apparatus of the state. Many people are afraid to go to work while others cannot patronize businesses due to cutbacks in services. Large transnational corporations are being impacted as well with layoffs in the auto industry, delivery services and hospitality sectors. Sonder corporation after ending its partnership with Marriot International, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Amazon, UPS, Verizon and others have announced the layoffs of tens of thousands of employees. These layoffs will compound the problem of joblessness brought about by the massive downsizing within the federal government since the Trump administration came to power. During the campaign for president in 2024, Trump claimed that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. After 10 months, the war rages on with Russian Federation troops now surrounding Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Sanctions against the Russian Federation and continuing weapons supplies from the U.S., UK and the European Union (EU) have failed to turn the tide of the war. Many other false statements related to ending the war in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have further exposed the ineffectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. The forced migration to at least five African states continues to prompt protests and legal actions in the U.S. and in at least one country on the continent. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is threatened with wider military assaults. Dozens have been executed extrajudicially by the Pentagon under the guise of fighting illegal drug smuggling into the U.S. In response, the government of President Nicholas Maduro has mobilized over 5 million people to resist any attempted land invasion. In Palestine people are still being killed, displaced, denied food and medical services weeks after a ceasefire was declared. Trump’s meeting with the Saudi monarchy will not benefit the workers and oppressed peoples in the U.S. and West Asia. These domestic and foreign initiatives by the U.S. administration are not reflective of growing strength among the imperialist states. It is a clear signal of a political quagmire and economic decline of Washington, Wall Street and its allies around the world. Therefore, the resistance movement to the Trump administration must seek allies broadly inside the U.S. as well as internationally. This global alliance of progressive and revolutionary forces provides the only method for the reversal of the present period of reaction. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Walmart raises sales outlook, boosted by e-commerce and higher-income shoppers

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Shoppers are still flocking to Walmart. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook Thursday, heading into the crucial holiday shopping season. Walmart also offered fresh signs that it is shedding its original identity as a strictly down-market brick-and-mortar operation by growing its e-commerce business and increasing its market share of higher-income shoppers. Walmart's shares closed more than 6% higher Thursday, even as the broader market suffered a dramatic sell-off. The stock is up more than 18% this year. The biggest retailer and grocer in the United States acknowledged the added financial pressures on lower-income households but said middle-income families are holding up. Walmart saw more sales growth in its grocery and health and wellness product categories than in general merchandise. "As pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items," Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said on a call with analysts Thursday morning. The company reported that same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the quarter that ended Oct. 31, exceeding analysts’ expectations. “The team delivered another strong quarter across the business. eCommerce was a bright spot again this quarter. We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart reported 27% growth in e-commerce sales globally. Walmart also announced that it will move from trading on the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq next month. It’s the latest sign of America's largest private employer working to position itself as tech-forward in order to compete with Amazon. The discounter's third-quarter earnings come amid growing questions about whether Americans contending with tariffs, corporate layoffs and accelerating inflation are still confidently spending on retail. As a bellwether for the U.S. economy and consumer confidence, Walmart’s strong earnings and guidance indicate that consumers are still shopping — at least at the lower end of the retail price point. The company announced last week that McMillon will step down in January. McMillon, 59, started at Walmart as an associate in the 1980s and has helmed the company since 2014. Under his leadership, Walmart improved pay and benefits for many employees, renovated hundreds of stores and boosted its e-commerce and delivery programs, especially during the Covid pandemic. John Furner, CEO of Walmart U.S., will take over the top job Feb. 1. Since 2019, Furner has led Walmart's American operations — by far the largest slice of the company, with around 1.6 million of Walmart's approximately 2.1 million total associates worldwide. Walmart is leading the retail race against longtime rival Target, which Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter sales and cut its full-year profit guidance. Target’s sales have faltered over the last few years, with some consumers expressing frustration over what they said were disorganized stores and rollbacks of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In October, Target said it would cut about 1,800 corporate jobs. Target is hoping for a fresh start in the new year. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke will take over Feb. 1, the same day Furner becomes CEO of Walmart. The struggling retailer said Wednesday that it plans to increase its investment in stores and technology next year by 25%. Since January, U.S. businesses have had to contend with ever-changing tariffs under the Trump administration. Walmart has navigated the uncertainty by raising prices on some items, while swallowing some tariff costs on others. In the three months that ended Oct. 31, prices at Walmart U.S. rose around 1% overall, with higher prices on electronics, toys and seasonal items in particular due to tariff pressures. In the grocery section, Walmart expects egg prices to drop but anticipates the record-breaking beef prices will stay high, in part from cattle herds shrinking over the last few decades. Prices for other grocery staples are also up, though the Trump administration's rollback of tariffs on many food items last week could offer some relief. Despite the rising prices, Walmart is offering its annual Thanksgiving menu deal for 10 at less than $4 per person. It's less expensive than last year's package, but it also contains fewer items. The company is also expanding its use of artificial intelligence, teaming up with OpenAI to allow customers to buy from Walmart within ChatGPT. Walmart has not detailed the terms of the partnership or shared when the new option could be available. This week, Target announced its own collaboration with OpenAI. Walmart has lagged behind rival Amazon in AI-driven e-commerce — Amazon debuted its Rufus shopping assistant in February 2024, more than a year before Walmart launched its counterpart, Sparky.

Title: Long-delayed jobs report to show hiring amid wobbly economy
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/long-delayed-jobs-report-show-hiring-amid-wobbly/story?id=127668400

The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as "stagflation." Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. “We have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. "A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it," Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Scott Horsley Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An overdue report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%. The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December. While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall. The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months. Loading... For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling. "Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode," Waller told a group of economists in London this week. Business leaders, he said, are "starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future." Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers. Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But minutes from the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers. Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year. Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting. But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. "You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door," Waller said. "And then these firms are not going to be hiring." While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios. The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs. The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring. Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come. "There's definitely a reduction of supply," he said. "But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The September jobs report is finally here

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The United States added 119,000 jobs in September, a stronger-than-expected figure and a sign that the economy was adding jobs at a healthy clip before government shutdown. But the details of the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a more mixed picture, that of a labor market that has recently begun to look wobblier amid high-profile layoff announcements from a host of blue-chip companies. September's employment gains were concentrated in health care, food and drinking establishments, and social assistance. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, though the pickup was due in part to an increase in the labor force, which the BLS said gained 450,000 new potential workers. The pace of wage growth slowed. Thursday’s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the BLS said Wednesday. The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market. But data from private and alternative sources has painted a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and stubborn price increases. Over the past few weeks, Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS have announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Their ranks were joined Thursday by Verizon, which announced the start of layoffs affecting 13,000, according to an internal memo. About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve — a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis. A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions. Whatever the exact total, those who do find themselves without work are now experiencing an average unemployment spell of 24.5 weeks — nearly six months. That’s the worst reading since November 2017. Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring. And what companies are still hiring are offering lower compensation rates that more experienced workers may have trouble accepting. The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said. Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a “post and pray” job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach. A bright spot has been local government, Price said — something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in. “It’s a weird market,” she said. Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration. “My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,” he said. In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable. The Fed’s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. “Most participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further” interest-rate cuts “could add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,” the notes said. So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires. “Fears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Pop In 2025 or 2026? How About Nvidia and OpenAI?

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Title: A shorter shopping window complicates retail’s already challenging holiday season

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was originally published on sister site, Modern Retail. This season, retailers and shoppers alike are contending with a shorter holiday shopping window — on top of tariffs, waning consumer sentiment and recession fears. The 2025 holiday shopping season is shorter than usual, with 28 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That’s one extra day compared to last year’s ultra-condensed shopping season, but four fewer shopping days than 2023. Cyber Monday will fall in December this year, and Christmas will be on a Thursday. By some metrics, the holiday shopping season is shaping up to be merry and bright. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising as much as 4.2% over last year. Similarly, EMarketer is forecasting holiday sales of $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year over year. But the holiday season is unfolding against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. U.S. employment is worsening with the highest level of October layoffs in 22 years last month, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Retail was one of the most heavily impacted industries, Modern Retail previously reported. Tariffs and inflation have also negatively colored consumer sentiment heading into retail’s biggest sales season. Consumer sentiment has fallen about 6% in November so far, according to the most recent survey from the University of Michigan. All told, this year’s condensed shopping calendar is landing at a difficult moment for the industry. Retailers are already juggling tariff-related cost pressures that have complicated everything from inventory planning to pricing strategy, and now they have fewer days to make up crucial fourth-quarter sales. Consumers, meanwhile, are heading into the season with shaky confidence, tighter budgets and heightened sensitivity to prices. Taken together, a shorter runway and a more cautious shopper are reshaping when — and how much — people are willing to spend, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already strained holiday period.“We’re going to see a lot of different headwinds this year, and this is one of them,” said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney, where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. Here’s a look at how retailers and consumers are preparing for a shorter holiday season complicated by President Donald Trump’s trade war, inflation and a worsening labor market. Over the past few years, retailers have pulled forward the timing of holiday deals, kicking off the season outside of tentpole occasions like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year was no exception, as Amazon effectively kicked off the holiday season with its earliest ever “Big Deals Prime Day” sale in October. The sale ran from Oct. 7 through Oct. 8, slightly earlier than last year’s event, when the sales ran from Oct. 8 until Oct. 9. Retailers including Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s introduced overlapping promotions to pull in early holiday demand ahead of the Black Friday peak. Some retailers introduced their holiday marketing campaigns well before Halloween. Macy’s, for instance, started its “100 Days to Christmas” campaign in September. Meanwhile, Nordstrom launched its holiday season campaign at the end of October. Walmart promoted its Thanksgiving meal basket in late October. That strategy may become even more important this year as retailers navigate fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, along with concerns about how tariffs and inflation may impact consumer spending. Kearney’s Black said that while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the season’s biggest tentpoles, this year’s economic backdrop is amplifying the need for strong early performance. “Cyber Monday and Black Friday have never been more important,” she said, adding that economic uncertainty and higher prices are motivating people to seek out promotions earlier in the season. According to Circana’s annual holiday outlook survey, 44% of U.S. consumers say they plan to begin their holiday shopping earlier than they normally would. That’s up four percentage points higher from Circana’s survey last year. Nearly half of consumers plan to start shopping before Thanksgiving. Less than 20% will wait until December, which marks the lowest level of late-season holiday shoppers since 2021, according to the survey. Black said the shorter holiday shopping calendar may also hinder impulse purchases. “You may be a little less likely to pick up the ‘Oh, I need to get another gift’ thing. … So, it can absolutely have an impact,” she said. A shorter shopping window means operational precision matters more. Retailers have only a few weeks to move inventory and meet tighter shipping deadlines. Black said the fundamentals will be critical: “They need to have fast shipping. It needs to be easy for [the] consumer. They need to have great in-stocks, and the experience really matters.” That pressure is pushing retailers to diversify last-mile options. Kevin Sides, CEO at logistics provider ShipMonk, said shifting volume to regional carriers has become one of the biggest logistics trends across his client base heading into the peak holiday season. Indeed, regional carriers like Jitsu, SpeedX and Veho ramped up their service coverage in the U.S. earlier this year, per Supply Chain Dive. “It’s not just FedEx and UPS getting orders out and delivered anymore. These regionals have way more of a market share,” Sides said, citing alternative parcel carriers like OnTrac and UniUni. “If 50% of your volume [is] not going with a regional, you’re leaving a lot on the table from both cost and performance.” More specialty retailers inked partnerships with delivery startups in 2025, rather than building out their own fulfillment networks, to better compete with behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Old Navy and DoorDash, for instance, launched a nationwide partnership for same-day delivery of clothing and holiday items, making it one of the first major apparel retailers on the platform. Ace Hardware also inked a deal with DoorDash earlier this year, offering on-demand delivery from local hardware stores. Despite the compressed calendar, Sides said consumers shouldn’t expect widespread delivery disruptions, as long as they avoid last-minute ordering and pay attention to shipping deadlines. “There’s not a carrier that’s not [delivering] packages in time for the holidays when you’re shipping by the third [of December],” he said. “But consumers shouldn’t wait too much to the last minute.” As the season wears on and shipping cutoffs tighten, more shoppers may turn to stores. Bain & Company’s holiday forecast predicts that 36% of U.S. consumers will shop entirely or mostly in physical stores, up from 24% in 2024. Large retailers with expansive store networks can also lean more heavily on same-day and buy-online, pick-up in-store options. Brad Jashinsky, director analyst at Gartner. said these capabilities will become more important as shipping cutoffs approach. As he put it, “That’s where the advantage of Amazon, Walmart, Target and others [comes in], where they can utilize their very sophisticated supply chains or … in-store” fulfillment.

Title: Coffee Break: Hasbara Ain’t Cheap, Musk, Ellison, Saudis, All Tapped

The practitioners of Hasbara are desperately ratcheting up their control of American corporate and social media and are reportedly seeking funding from the Arab Gulf states to help. The MAGA/MIGA conflict that is splitting Trump’s Republican coalition is one factor stressing zionist narrative control, but fundamentally fallout from Gaza is driving the desperation. The increasingly precarious state of the AI bubble that’s been propping up Silicon Valley and the entire American economy is putting more pressure on the financial underpinnings of Hasbara, Inc. Holocaust Education Sending Wrong Message? Former Obama, Clinton, Kerry and Gore speechwriter Sarah Hurwitz perhaps spoke more truth than she meant to when speaking (video) at the The 2025 General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America. Hurwitz starts with a pretty standard condemnation of 21st Century communications, blaming social media, although it is interesting to note her definition of “mainstream” as not expressing “extreme anti-Israel views.” I think that since October 7th, but really before then, there have been huge shifts in America on how people think about Jews and Israel. And I think that is especially true of young people. So, we are now wrestling with a new, I think, generational divide here. And I think that’s particularly true in that social media is now our source of media. It used to be that the the media you got in America was American media and it was pretty mainstream. It generally didn’t express extreme anti-Israel views. You had to go to a pretty weird bookstore to find global media and fringe media. But today, we have social media, which is a global medium. It is shaped, its algorithms are shaped by billions of people worldwide who don’t really love Jews. And so, while in the 1990s, you know, a young person probably wasn’t going to find Al Jazeera or someone like Nick Fuentes, today those media outlets find them. They find them on their phones. It’s also this increasingly post-literate media, less and less text, more and more videos. So, you have Tik Tok just smashing our young people’s brains all day long with video of carnage in Gaza. And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. So I want to give data and information and facts and arguments and they are just seeing in their minds carnage and I sound obscene. It’s also noteworthy that she does not see video evidence of mass murder as something that should be weighed equally with “facts and arguments.” But the novel thing she said regarded “Holocaust education” which she characterizes as “a very smart bet that made” “in this new media environment” but is now worried that it “may be confusing some of our young people” into thinking that “anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism” and “the lesson of the Holocaust is that you fight Israel.” I’m quoting this section in full because it’s the kind of thing that would have been dismissed as anti-Semitic conspiracy theory if said by Lyndon Larouche in the 1990s. And you know, I think unfortunately the very smart bet that we made on Holocaust education to serve as anti-Semitism education in this new media environment, I think that is beginning to break down a little bit because, you know, Holocaust education is absolutely essential, but I think it may be confusing some of our young people about anti-Semitism because they learn about big strong nazis hurting weak emaciated Jews and they think, ‘Oh, anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism, right? powerful white people against powerless black people.’ So when on TikTok all day long they see powerful Israelis hurting weak, skinny Palestinians, it’s not surprising that they think, ‘Oh, I know the lesson of the Holocaust is you fight Israel. You fight the big powerful people hurting the weak.’ Caitlin Johnstone titled her response “Zionists Are Freaking Out About Losing Control Of The Narrative” and I’ll quote a key passage: It’s just so fascinating to see a former White House speechwriter making so many of the points that anti-Zionists have been making for years, but taking the exact opposite meaning from them. … Hurwitz isn’t denying Israel’s abuses or framing its genocidal atrocities as the problem, she’s just coming right out and saying that people obtaining information and moral clarity about those abuses is the problem. The atrocities aren’t wrong, what’s wrong is people seeing those atrocities and calling them what they are. I love the way she complains that she looks “obscene” for trying to lay out arguments and narratives justifying the Gaza holocaust for people who’ve seen the “wall of carnage” from the genocide. I mean, yes. Yes obviously you’re going to look obscene if you try to tell someone why raw video footage of massacres, mutilated children and emaciated bodies is actually showing something that is justifiable and acceptable. You can’t stand in front of a pile of child corpses justifying their murder and then whine when people ignore your spinmeistering and keep staring at the tiny bodies. That’s like murdering an entire family and then telling the cops, “But you’re not listening to my reasons for killing them!” They’re doing the normal thing while you are being obscene. So yea, there’s that. Now that we’ve set the context and shown the panic driving Israel’s quest for total narrative control, let’s look at some of the tactical aspects of that quest. Taking Hasbara to Church and ChatGPT Haaretz dropped a blockbuster report ten days ago that reveals the aggressive and ambitious nature of Hasbara in 2025: The Israeli government has signed contracts worth millions of dollars in recent months to rehabilitate Israel’s standing in American public opinion, both online and offline. Amid a sharp drop in support from the conservative right, Israel has hired firms to conduct not just “hasbara [public diplomacy] campaigns” but also campaigns targeting millions of Christian churchgoers, bot networks to amplify pro-Israel messages online, and efforts to influence both search results and the responses given by popular AI services like ChatGPT. Among the experts recruited is a former campaign manager for Donald Trump and many of the other firms are linked to the Republican party or Evangelical communities, indicating that Israel is focusing massive efforts on communities once considered automatically pro-Israel. Among the campaigns’ goals is fighting antisemitism, which has risen alongside the decline in support for Israel. Together, these campaigns signal a new phase in Israel’s post-war public diplomacy strategy, and a shift in the way it uses agents – both AI and human influencers – for hasbara abroad. … Payments are routed through Havas Media Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of the international advertising and public relations giant Havas. In practice, Havas serves as an intermediary, executing contracts with U.S. firms on Israel’s behalf. The documents show that since 2018, the company has received at least $100 million to promote Israeli tourism campaigns in the United States and it also works with other countries, including several in the Gulf, on similar projects. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X, owned by Brad Parscale, who played a lead role in Trump’s digital campaigns in 2016 and 2020. The $6 million, four-month contract – signed between his firm and Havas Media on behalf of the Israeli government – calls for “strategic consulting, planning, and communications services to develop and execute a broad U.S. campaign to combat antisemitism.” According to the filing, Parscale’s company will produce “at least 100 core pieces of content per month” – including videos, audio, podcasts, graphics and text – and “5,000 derivative versions” monthly, aiming for 50 million impressions a month. Eighty percent of the content will target young Americans on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Campaign messages will be distributed via Salem Media Network, a conservative Christian media group that owns more than 200 radio stations and websites. Parscale was appointed this year to lead Salem’s strategy. Lucrative work if you can get it and don’t mind a little blood on your fangs hands. The American Conservative has more details on the Salem Media aspect of this caper: Salem Media, one of America’s largest conservative media conglomerates, may have already begun integrating paid-for Israeli government narratives across its extensive network of platforms. The arrangement, formalized through a seven-figure contract, raises significant questions about the intersection of foreign influence on an increasingly fracturing conservative media environment. Salem did not respond to The American Conservative’s request for comment. In September, the Israeli government retained Salem Media’s chief strategy officer, Brad Parscale, to advocate for Israeli interests through a $6 million financial arrangement. The contract filed with the Department of Justice explicitly outlines the “integration of narrative messaging into Salem Media Network properties and aligned distribution channels” as one of its key deliverables. Salem Media operates 82 radio stations across the United States and manages high-profile websites like Townhall and RedState that serve as influential platforms in shaping conservative discourse. Salem also hosts multiple podcasts featuring prominent voices in the conservative movement. Among those programs are The Charlie Kirk Show, The Dinesh D’Souza Podcast, The Josh Hammer Show, and The Right View with Lara Trump. According to company data, the network generates 80 million monthly website page views with 37 million monthly app visits. Salem’s newsletter operation reaches 4 million active subscribers, delivering 310 million newsletters every month, and also touts 44 million “fans” on Facebook. Parscale now serves dual roles: advancing Salem’s business interests while simultaneously working as a registered and compensated foreign agent for Israel. The implications extend to Salem’s roster of prominent commentators, particularly Dinesh D’Souza and Josh Hammer, who have become central figures in an escalating debate within conservative circles about America’s relationship with Israel and role in the Middle East policy more broadly. But Parscale can’t do it all alone. Musk’s X No Longer Translating Hebrew Clearly this is a time to leave no stone unturned for Team Hasbara, so they mopped up an embarrassing detail this week, or maybe Elon Musk did it all on his own out of his sincere concern about anti-Semitism. I’ll let Grok explain: Translation from Hebrew was disabled because it often amplified inflammatory or policy-violating content, like calls for violence, to a global audience via inaccurate or literal renditions. X prioritizes free speech for opinions but limits features that exacerbate harm without… — Grok (@grok) November 16, 2025 As to why Elon Musk might think this was necessary, here’s one example translated from the Hewbrew: pic.twitter.com/yDseDDhbg2 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 TikTok Is Now a Zionist Free Speech Zone While it’s not entirely clear that a new ownership consortium including Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz have completed their takeover of TikTok (based on I don’t believe anything Trump 2.0 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant says and he’s the one saying the deal is done), what is clear is that their new Public Policy Manager, Hate Speech, Erica Mindel is on the J-O-B. Before we look at Mindel’s work, let’s review what’s been reported about the new owners, via Forbes: Software giant Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and MGX, an AI-focused investment firm established by the government of Abu Dhabi, are expected to own around 45% of the new TikTok. Silver Lake also has significant ties to the Gulf States with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. owning 5% of the VC firm. But let’s get back to Erica Mandel and her work at Tik Tok, via Mel the Village Crazy Lady: Remember that time that Congress held a billion hearings on “antisemitism on TikTok” because people were sharing videos from Gaza? Well now that Zionists own the platform, this is what their spaces sound like: https://t.co/cH2hE2pSyK pic.twitter.com/jRJqFT5EUp — Mel (@Villgecrazylady) November 18, 2025 Both videos feature a man identified as “Older Millennial” who is indulging in grossly eliminationist rhetoric like “if we leave a scrap of Palestinian DNA in Gaza…”, “if we destroy everything in Gaza what will be the loss to mankind”, and in the top video he proposed issuing “hunting licenses” to those wishing to murder Palestinians in Gaza. Cleansing Tik Tok of Pro-Palestinian Voices Lest you think Mindel has been idle, since she came on board Tik Tok no longer serves up anything in response to searches for Nick Fuentes, and is “banning users from calling the IDF “terrorists” and rolling out automated moderation that retroactively wipes posts. Users report “Free Palestine” comments disappearing in real time and Israeli war-crimes videos taken down” per Drop Site News. Glenn Greenwald spoke to Guy Christensen, an American advocate for Gaza and Tik Tokker with 3.5 million followers on the platform about the new Hasbara regime on the site. The 19-year-old Christensen explains that prior to October 7, 2023, he was a non-political poster on the platform with over 2 million followers when “my feed was flooded with pro-Israel propaganda dehumanizing Palestinians. And me having no prior knowledge about Israel was shocked. I was disgusted by what I was hearing, not like not knowing anything. And, that shock provoked me to dig into the reality of Gaza.” Christensen was “disenrolled” from Ohio State University in May after completing his freshman year. The univeristy claimed it “received ‘myriad communications’ from ‘members of the university community’ expressing their ‘fear of violence and for their personal safety based on (Christensen’s) social media posts.’ Christensen blames Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic Congressman Richie Torres, among others, for driving his expulsion. The ACLU has taken up Christensen’s cause in a lawsuit. But back to our topic, regarding the new Tik Tok policies Christensen says: They mandate that people have to condemn terrorist groups designated by the US State Department, when mentioned in any videos, even when mentioned in a neutral, investigative context. They opened the door to classifying anti-Israel speech as hate speech based on their new clause about national origin. They ban the reading of manifestos. They restrict videos from the feed that show videos from war, aka Gaza. And so I’ve been forced and other people have been forced to stop showing real footage, real imagery from the destruction of the Palestinian nation in the Gaza Strip. As soon as these uh changes went into effect, my videos started getting banned or removed from the recommendation feed left and right. And to kind of put this into perspective, over the last, you know, almost 2 years before these changes, as I was posting consistently about Palestine every single day, there’s only been a handful of videos that I’ve ever gotten removed. I looked and over the last year prior to September 13th, it was one or two that you could even count. So very quickly (after the new policies were implemented) I racked up about 10 violations either (videos) removed completely without any recourse to appeal or they were shadowbanned. I would get like um 100 views from people who only went directly to my profile to view it and my fellow collaborators fellow people in the movement on TikTok, I reached out to them and they reported back the same exact thing. Many accounts other than Christensen’s, including Breaking Points Krystal Ball, have been throttled, banned, or shadowbanned on Tik Tok since Mindel took over “hate speech” on the platform. No one is even bothering to pretend that Chinese manipulation of the algorithm, the ostensible reason the platform was banned by the U.S. Congress, was really a concern. Rather the Washington Post handwrings about the 17-to-1 preponderance of pro-Palestinian videos vs pro-Israel videos on the platform. The hasbara happens out in the open now. The Ellisons Have Been Busy Hasbara Elves at Paramount Since I last updated about David Ellison (Larry’s nepo-baby) and Paramount, the team has been busy cracking down on free speech. Per Variety: An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. … Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. [Update, Nov. 7: Other sources intimately familiar with Paramount said that while an itemized list does not exist, the management team shares a set of values and has no desire to work with anyone who expresses hate in public and damaging ways]. Bari Weiss’ takeover at CBS News is also getting press, from Puck at the end of October: she has had real discussions about the feasibility of their transfer. Her targets have included Fox News anchors Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer, and Dana Perino, as well as CNN analyst Scott Jennings; and, as I reported earlier this week, she has also discussed expanding Anderson Cooper’s role at the network beyond 60 Minutes. In an industry where talent acquisition has its own set rules of engagement, Bari’s instinctive and freewheeling approach has struck many as unorthodox. To many TV news veterans, it is also seen as a sign of her inexperience and lack of managerial finesse. Network executives lock their talent into yearslong contracts—Anderson’s runs through 2026, Bret’s into 2028, and Dana’s into the 2030s—and include specified negotiation windows that don’t open until the final three to six months of the agreement. Savvier network leaders tend to re-up their stars before that window ever opens. Getting out of these contracts isn’t impossible, of course, but it doesn’t happen on a whim—and it usually requires quite a bit of discretion. The casual, D.I.Y. approach is very on brand for Bari, and presumably one of the reasons that David Ellison brought her in to disrupt the business. In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict. (On Friday, Trump sat down with Norah O’Donnell for his first interview on the network since he sued 60 Minutes.) Paramount Alone Isn’t Enough But Paramount is small beans in the overall media picture, which explains the Ellisons’ drive to acquire WBD (Warner Bros Discovery). Keep in mind, streaming has completely upended the American media business. The lumbering titans that bought up most of the nation’s TV networks and movie studios are getting pwned by Netflix and Alphabet’s YouTube. pic.twitter.com/fqYJtLxYmu — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Let’s hear from The New York Times regarding Paramount’s efforts to acquire WBD: Over the course of four weeks, Paramount made three offers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, ratcheting up the financial stakes of a deal that would reshape the media landscape. … The move essentially kicked off a public frenzy of interest from other potential suitors this week, including Comcast and Amazon. If they bid, that could pressure Paramount to further increase its offer. Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it was initiating a sale because of “the unsolicited interest of multiple parties” for both some parts and all of the company. Paramount’s first bid was for $19 a share, before moving up to $22 in late September. Paramount’s latest bid was delivered on Oct. 13, offering to pay the company’s shareholders $23.50 a share in cash and stock, according to the letter. That offer represented an 87 percent premium to Warner Bros. Discovery’s share price before its intent to make a bid for the company was first reported on in early September. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. shares closed at $20.53. A takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount would be a tectonic shift for the media industry. It would combine two of the largest Hollywood studios, Warner Bros. and Paramount, granting huge clout at the box office and putting CNN and CBS News under the same corporate umbrella, which would give the new company enormous sway over the news industry. It would combine Paramount+ and HBO Max, two of the biggest streaming services, bringing the company’s movies and shows into hundreds of millions of living rooms. According to Variety (in a report which Paramount denies), Paramount is “putting together a $71 billion bid for WBD in conjunction with funds from three Arab countries: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).” Regarding Paramount’s denial, one media insider reports: Sources familiar with the talks say the connections behind that capital did not appear on their own. Ari Emanuel has long standing ties across Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, and he publicly supported Ellison’s previous Paramount effort. Paramount issued a denial, but multiple industry sources confirmed that a holding company structure allows outside capital to participate without ever appearing on Paramount’s balance sheet. I’ve previously posted on Ari Emanuel’s involvement in the Ellisons’ acquisition of Paramount. Yahoo Finance had more on the wheeling and dealing going on in the Trump White House this week while the POTUS is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and cutting some private Trump organization deals of their own): Elon Musk, Tim Cook, golfer Bryson DeChambeau and other notables will join Ellison at a black-tie dinner held in the Saudi royal’s honor, a person familiar with the guest list tells Deadline. Earlier Tuesday, Trump met with Cristiano Ronaldo, the soccer star who recently re-upped his $200 million-a-year contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr. Ronaldo was also on the guest list for the dinner. A Variety report, citing anonymous sources, said a coalition involving Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, had formed in support of a forthcoming $71 billion bid by Paramount for WBD, which would be a notch higher than prior bids in the $60 billion-plus range. Now why would David Ellison need to go to the Gulf States to fund his hasbara? Maybe Daddy’s company Oracle is having some financial issues? Oracle Doesn’t Have Infinite Money CNBC reports that Oracle has lost one third of its market cap since September and is issuing $38 billion in debt to “finance its AI buildout”. Reuters is reporting that investor sentiment on that Oracle debt is bearish: Oracle bonds have taken a hit in recent days following a report that the cloud and artificial intelligence service provider plans to add another $38 billion to its heavy debt load to fund its AI infrastructure, according to analysts and investors. … “What’s interesting is most of the (major tech) companies are trying to sustain their (stock) buyback programs at the same time that they’re spending on capex currently and to do that, they’re actually borrowing and so they’re using debt,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The price of Oracle’s bonds maturing in 2033 with a 4.9% coupon has dipped, pushing yields up more than three basis points over the last two weeks, while the yield on its newer bonds maturing in 2032 with a 4.8% coupon has risen almost two basis points in one week, according to market participants. And The Financial Times put out a doozy of a report asserting that “Oracle’s net debt is already at 2.5 times ebitda, having more than doubled since 2021, and it’s expected to nearly double again by 2030. Cash flow is forecast to remain negative for five straight years.” The piece included several charts, including this particularly brutal one: pic.twitter.com/TTs0b2Q1Hw — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Time will tell if the Ellisons’ hasbara-promoting media empire will grow even larger, but at the moment it appears to be on the proverbial knife’s edge.

And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. Good on the younger Jews. Don’t let the old fuckers gaslight you into believing up is down. I think Nassim Taleb is right about social media being more a return to common sense and a two way debate than the programmed propaganda of traditional media. Ideas and opinions have to stand on their merits and against the opinions of others. People are freer to hold their own views on social media. Ultimately most people are reasonable, and know right from wrong. Essentially, Israel and its foreign assets are freaking out because the heretofore wildly successful color revolution In the US is being challenged. Where’s Waldo? Noting: “In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict.” Hilary. What are you doing in that group? Grifting again? Blabbering about how stupid your Columbia students were? Special cameo appearance, too, by gay icon Tim Cook. Ahhh, role models. Time to throw some to the flames. ” Time to throw some to the flames.” Or, as an unrepentant misogynist I knew once put it: “Time for a good old fashioned Auto da Fem.” Yes, if you want to do “cutting edge” deals, bin Salman is the one to see. The first thing I remember watching about the Jews in WWII when I was pretty young was the TV movie The Wall, which at the time I thought was a dramatic retelling of history, but that I now recognize as hasbara. It came out in 1982, which I’ve come to learn is about the time Israeli propaganda really kicked into high gear. My understanding (and older commenters, please correct me if I’m wrong here) is that before the 70s or so, WWII was looked upon as a great tragedy for the whole world, but not as a war specifically fought to persecute and murder Jewish people. Millions of Jews died, but many millions more Russians and Chinese did too, among others. Plenty of misery to go around. It wasn’t until a few decades after the war that Israel developed the narrative that the war was about them and their special grievances in order to justify allowing the Israeli government to get away with whatever it wanted to with impunity. Yes, Nazi Germany killed millions more of Russians in battle than Jews, but the extermination camps created by the Nazis were primarily intended for Europe’s Jewish population. WWII was not about the Jews, but it is incontrovertible that Nazi Germany attempted to exterminate all of European Jewry. Systematically rounding up a population and sending them by rail to gas chambers for extermination was an atrocity never before seen in war. That said, what Germany did to the Jews in WWII does not excuse Israel for what is has done in Gaza. Don’t forget the gays and the Romani people. They too were Nazi “untermenchen” As well as various “defective” people supposedly polluting the gene pool…. Agreed. War is hell and gives people the excuse to justify atrocities. There are no clean ones fought by ‘the rules’. There were 1 million+ Greeks ethnically cleansed from Anatolia during WWI and that’s not even on most people’s radar, and wouldn’t be on mine if not for some partial Greek heritage. Genocide against Jews in WWII wasn’t the first in history, and the current Zionist entity is proving beyond doubt that it wasn’t to be the last. But the way these various horrific events are referred to in today’s Western society is very different. Those who comprise the Zionist entity which puts out the hasbara Nat discusses, where the problem isn’t the wholesale slaughter of other human beings but the negative PR, are a psychologically damaged people. There’s a lot hanging on the terms “rail” and “gas chambers” in that statement, but it is incontrovertibly true the Nazis would have been quite happy if the Jews had all shipped off to Anywheresville as long as it wasn’t anywhere in Europe. The American genius was to genocide the indigenous populations without recourse to neither rail nor gas but nontheless providing the basic conceptual model for the subsequent Nazi experiment with Slavs, Gypsies and Jews. However, the most successful genocide in European history, ie, no survivors, is that of the Cathars whose frenzied slaughter was led by none other than that champion of the oligarchy as the governing principle of England, and by extension the US, Simon de Montfort, after whom an English university is named. Simon de Montfort, famous for his role in Parliamentary history, was a younger son of the crusader also called, Simon de Montfort. The younger Simon, being a younger son conceded the family’s French seat to his older brother, but received family support for laying at least partial claim to the title and lands of the Earl of Leicester, which the elder had had a claim to through his mother, a Beaumont. Both Simons played a part in the Magna Carta. Simon, the genocidaire and fifth earl of Leicester, was protecting his interests in 1215, and his son, the sixth earl of Leicester, was both a crusading genocidaire in Gascony, like his dad, but his brother-in-law, Henry III, was none too happy about it and, ultimately, after going on another crusade and coming home to a bit of turmoil, defeated Henry in 1264, called parliament in 1265 and promptly got himself killed at Evesham in the same year. Both men, it seems, were rat’s arses who got off on killing people with different beliefs. Very few of the 12 million Soviet civilian victims died in the battles, they were tortured, labored and starved to death unless just executed as an example. They were not collected to camps, just driven inside their churches and burned. In Belarus alone Germans erased over 600 villages completely (with their inhabitants) and partially destroyed over 5000. All and all the number of destroyed villages was over 70,000. The very concept of “lebensraum” included only the raum, not the people leben there at the time. That was only for the “Aryans”. It was a purposeful, genocidal, on-site ethnic cleansing. Under General Plan Ost, the Slavs of the Eastern Front (Poland, Ukraine, Baltics, Russia) were also intended to be exterminated, by a combination of killings, working to death and restricting their food. A small remainder were to be enslaved. In this respect, the concentration and extermination camps were laboratories for a much greater programme of Slavic extermination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost The justification claimed by Israel could be claimed by Poland and the Ukraine and Russia too…. I remember even in the early-mid 80s most WWII programs were more tilted towards the Pacific rather than European theatre. Probably because the US was pretty much solo there. I think it was the xian/born again stranglehold of the 80s that really cemented the zionazi mentality. Afterall, Reagan was a firm believer in jesus returning after jews went back to israel…so the xians can then convert or kill them all. I can’t speak for the 1970s vs. the 1980s, but I do know that by the 1990s a lot of “new” narratives about World War 2 were so entrenched, that anyone going up against them, including unwittingly, was getting blacklisted by both media and academia. Norman Finkelstein (“The Holocaust Industry”) comes to mind, but it wasn’t just hasbara-related; I recommend “History Wars” (from 1996!!) for a great summary of the scandal manufactured around the Smithsonian’s attempt to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings. Meanwhile, this apparently had not been the case in the 1960s, based on what’s in the older history books, e.g. William Shirer’s “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich”. So somewhere between the 60s and the 90s the switch must have gotten flipped. Insofar as the numbers. Nazi Germany was responsible for >20 million civilian and PoW deaths – ~18 million in the Soviet Union, including 3 of the 6 million Holocaust victims (which are hardly ever mentioned in “Holocaust literature”, by the way), plus 3 million of the non-Soviet Holocaust victims, >1 million in Poland, and at least hundreds of thousands if not a million plus in former Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Plus French resistance and the like, so maybe the figure is closer to 25 million. But it’s not just that, it’s the shift in focus. I watched a fascinating lecture a few years ago, where a guy just took the tourist brochures at the Auschwitz museum from different eras, and compared them. The one from the 1950s was a 200 page book (!!), explaining in detail how the Nazis came to power, why they murdered >20 million people, the whole history of the Holocaust specifically, but including how German industrialists profited from it (by working to death those Jews who were not sent to the gas chambers immediately), and on and on and on. The brochure from the 2020s? Three or so large format pages with more pictures than text, the sum of which comes down to – Hitler was evil for the sake of evil, and hated Jews because he hated Jews, and exterminated 6 million of them thusly, the end. Now, it isn’t just the effect of hasbara specifically – but that’s part of it, because if you start describing German settler colonialism, someone is bound to ask the question of how Israel’s settler colonialism is different, aside from specific tactics chosen. To be sure, it isn’t all bad in Thick History Book Land (just more bad than good). But that’s not where the great majority of the populace is, hence TikTok and CBS-WB… Germany in WWII mostly observed the Geneva Conventions with regard to POWs in the West, but embarked on exterminationist policies against the Soviets. At least 1.3 million Soviets held as POWs were murdered quite apart from battle deaths. Cold War propaganda distorted narratives of WWII atrocities in general. The firebombing of Dresden (in the Soviet zone of occupation so the evidence was in Soviet custody) for example “expanded” in Soviet propaganda by an order of magnitude to 200,000 dead. For the Americans, Stalin’s crimes had to be lumped into the common basket of “totalitarianism”. Local complicity and resistance made for morally complex stories coming from France, the Netherlands, fascist Italy and Papal Rome, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and as we are all now aware, Ukraine. I think awareness of the holocaust assumed all of its contradictory parts at least from the last days of WWII, but was layered over with many salient events and retellings, including movies and books and news events. Zionists were sure they had the answer even in the 1930s. The cynical reaction of Norman Finkelstein or John Mearsheimer began to emerge in the late 20th century. Kudos for a great round-up. Timely and important. My pleasure. Been meaning to get back to this topic but Mamdani and the MAGA civil war have been eating up my slots. Ditto Sunshine. Forwarding. Ditto Ditto Much appreciated NWT! Interesting to see the name Havas Media here helping with the Hasbara effort. The current owner, Bolloré, is a far right French industrialist billionaire who’s been accumulating propaganda outlets by buying out and then transforming formerly traditionally center left or left French media over the past decade or so into bilious anti Muslim and far right French Catholic (a huge subject) outlets to manipulate French opinion. The journalists that come with the acquisitions are unionized and fight with the few legal means at their disposal (it’s a strangely regulated profession) until they eventually just quit. Havas itself was built on money generated from the cotton trade, when it was produced by slavery, first in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and after the revolution in Brazil. Dirty money seems to stain permanently. Or in Balzacian terms “Derrière chaque grande fortune se cache un crime”. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X Sure makes me wonder about the Kirk assassination. Curious for it to happen as the hasbara rubber is hitting road. Here in Michigan as in several other states genocide, the Holocaust/ Jewish genocide and Armenian genocide are required to be taught in the public schools. There is a panel to approve the content. I have written those responsible for overseeing this as well as my state legislators as well Congresswoman Tlaib’s office to suggest that the Gaza genocide be added to the program. I received no responses. I managed to get myself blocked from further posting or commenting on Substack, since this; https://johnmerryman.substack.com/p/gods-problems Given my problems are not about politics, ethnicities, or any of the social and cultural branding, but the basic conceptual foundations of Western Civ, in this case, monotheism, I don’t really have a problem with the hasbara, as it is turning the entire media system into used toilet paper and sucking the political flunkies down with it. Ask yourself, is God Spirit, or Authority? They are not synonymous….. Democracy and republicanism originated in pantheistic cultures. And here I was thinking I might be allowed to express myself on substack. Thanks for disabusing me of that fantasy. The hasbara was happening long before the ’80’s. I remember the “making the desert bloom” hasbara coming in the late ’50’s. No mention of Zionists taking inventory of the best farms in Palestine in the ’30’s and ’40’s to be acquired (stolen) after 1948. Historian Illan Pape writes about that from actual records. There was a plan, it was implemented with German efficiency and explained as something else. What was that Goebbels said about repeating a lie frequently enough? a link would be great, I did a quick search and found this but if a person knew a more relevant to comment link that would be better, not a criticism per se, but more the farther down the pilot hole, the easier to set the screw… https://www.stopthejnf.org/the-jnf-the-principal-zionist-tool-for-the-colonization-of-palestine-by-ilan-pappe/ this is from 2023, earlier might be better A useful link might be Leon Uris’ novel, “Exodus,” published in 1958. That was the year I graduated high school and I read it and loved it. So inspiring! “Exodus” the film was released in 1960. Starring …. swoon ….. Paul Newman! One of the most effective propaganda films ever. By the time I graduated college in 1962, most of my friends were seriously considering spending time on Israeli communes, to help make ‘the desert bloom.’ It was decades later that I learned about the 1948 Nakba, the expulsion of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and farms, from the reading I did after 9/11, especially a small book by I.F. Stone. Yes, with the lyrics to the Schlockmeister theme song – “This land is mine/ God gave this land to me” – written by the uber-Goyishe pop star, Pat Boone, of all people. tegnost – here is a link to an excellent overview of “Blaming the Victims”, a book published in 1988 about myths connected to the founding of Israel. https://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/28th-may-1988/28/it-takes-two-to-tell-the-truth My parents were living in the Lebanon at that time, and did volunteer relief work with Palestinian refugees. They met many who had been driven from their homes at gunpoint. They were surprised to get home and hear that the Nakba happened because Arab leaders had broadcast instructions to Palestinians to flee their homes. That’s one of the myths addressed in the essay. It may be that since the Zionists took over Tik Tok, that it will just become another Bluesky meaning an echo chamber which the kids will just abandon. There may even be lingering resentment by those kids how their Tik Tok was taken off them and just become another Hasbara outlet courtesy of the government. The Zionists may have taken over CBS News too but when you get down to it, how many kids gets their info from CBS News in the first place? I would have figured their audience to be a much older cohort. So what will the Zionists do? Sure they will try to make all those atrocity videos be disappeared down a Memory Hole but I would not be surprised if they eventually tried to convince people that all those atrocity videos are just AI videos and that nothing ever happened. It’s all the work of Hamas don’tcha know? The civilization gods are bigger than the tribal gods. Even if the tribal gods ruled for hundreds of thousands of years and the civilization gods for only the least several thousand. The Golden Rule is a better long term strategy than Kill all the Amaleks, because what goes round, comes round. This is close to my thinking on how this will play out. The fact the Israeli system and friends are resorting to it while otherwise digging a deeper hole adds to a theory of mine: When the Israelis got a Jewish state, most of them rapidly traded in the proverbial “yiddishe kop”. On a related note, I think there’s an even deeper reason it won’t work, and I’ve been surprised that nobody else seems to have expressed it yet. For several reasons, I don’t post much on Gaza and Israel, but I think almost everyone is misdiagnosing why youth support for Israel, especially in the US, is collapsing. Gaza has definitely accelerated things, and also stripped away much of the Jewish claim to special treatment after the Holocaust. But the clouds could part tomorrow, the Palestinians and Israelis could make peace, with everything between them forgiven… and all but the most clueless younger American would carry on a simmering ill will towards Israel. Gaza is not the prime mover. The deeper rupture is only now presenting openly, still jumbled up and expressed in inchoate ways, but to put it simply, a blood debt has been incurred. America vis-a-vis Israel, regardless of how Israel justifies it in its own interests. This has nothing to do with anti-Semitic bigotry (though some will make tactical alliances and unfortunately many may drift into it). All one has to do is look at any American political issue in my lifetime that touched on “our future”, then ask which side the Israeli body politic actively enabled. New owners trying to buy up or cut down media channels as quick as they spring up is Sisyphean enough. Beyond any platform though, people in this country will keep the score in their own lives, and all but the most irredeemable suckers will conclude that Israel treats the average American as an enemy. And someday America will return the favor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnJucRfS_ig Nah man, my mom’s on woowoo. > my mom’s on woowoo. LOL #ExactlyThis Thanks again Nat, for this breakdown! @allbrt: I wwas wondering where in the hierarchy of visited sites TikTok sits … • According to semrush.com, TikTok is not even in the Top 20 in the United States. It’s 16th if you open up to the entire globe. • Across multiple stat tracking entities, TikTok settles somewhere around 17th in popularity. So I guess #T3amZ10ni5M paid a whole lotta money to get the 17th to 20-something-th most popular site to push their propaganda … FWIW, a lot of the content making waves in on YT now. YouTube, by comparison, in #2. I was going to mention how most of that top 20 was generic or shopping related, so not that relevant in shaping opinions….. but then I noticed that DDG is now bigger than either Twitter (X) or Bing!!! When did that happen? And Yahoo is somehow still alive!?! (these days, I’ll take whatever glimmers of hope I can find : ) I was surprised as well. I guess one may want to filter to social network sites since that’s where the Hasbara is focused. YouTube is not technically a social-networking site, but since the rise of its Shorts, I think you kinda have to include it since Tik-Tok exists basically as a short-video site. If we change the filter to global (so Tik-Tok shows up in the top 20), and filter out non-social-networking sites, you get: Site – Visits YouTube – 49B Facebook – 10B Instagram – 6B Reddit – 5B X – 4B Tik-Tok – 2B So the 6th largest Social Networking presence globally, but 25 times less visits than YT, and 5 times less than FB. Some big Boomer/GenX energy still out there … LOL #MyMomsOnWooWoo Why would Arab states want to fund hasbara? And famously, Smotrich said it might be moral to starve 2 million Palestinians. That might sound unfriendly, but don’t you dare compare him to that moustache guy. He only said 2 million instead of 6 million, so it’s not the same thing at all. https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/middleeast/israeli-minister-smotrich-starve-gazans-intl/ Kind of in the same spirit, I can’t help but notice how much Matt Taibbi seems to have realized who his (heftily paying audience – at least for Substack – $10/month!) really is. https://www.racket.news/p/the-jeffrey-epstein-story-is-beginning So now the whole Epstein affair is another Russiagate. Whatever keeps those new right-wing subscribers clicking and paying, I guess? Though his deterioration, moral and professional, has been apparent for years now, it’s still sad. Once upon a time, he was a good reporter. Of all these, I think the TikTok thing will be most effective. I’d guess that very few young ‘uns will dump TikTok over this as it won’t affect their main usage needs (dances or whatever they are up to). So TikTok will continue, just without informing the kids about the Zionist genocide. Sure, some will follow it by other means but a lot will just slip back into ignorance.

Title: Kyle Butler

Full Content:
Kyle Butler eats, sleeps, and breathes tattooing. The Aurora-born artist and entrepreneur has been collecting ink since he gave himself his first stick ’n’ poke at age 14 (it was the Deathwish Skateboards logo). A week after his 18th birthday, he moved to Chicago to study creative writing at Columbia College and soon began home tattooing. Two years later, he dropped out to devote himself to what had become a full-blown obsession. Now 33, he’s the sole owner of the Irving Park street shop Red Devil Tattoo, which he started with Miranda Larson in 2021, and also runs a private, appointment-only studio nearby. As tattooing moved from an underground industry to a “legitimate” trade in the late 20th century, home tattooing became frowned upon by the broader professional community. But many artists—including many industry trailblazers—had started as so-called “scratchers.” Over the past decade, home tattooing has experienced something of a renaissance thanks to the wide availability of single-use needles (an industry standard since the early 2000s) and home tattoo machines, along with the ubiquity of social media as a tool for learning and self-promotion. Butler embodies a shop owner who came from the modern underground. He remains excited about how reduced barriers to entry have led to fresh styles and ideas in tattooing. At the same time, he encourages a reverence for tattoo history and an investment in the craftsmanship (such as learning to build one’s own machines) that’s often lost to younger artists. To Butler, tattooing isn’t a trade, it’s a lifestyle—and he can’t imagine any other. I tattooed myself when I was 14. Then I got a tattoo in Indiana when I was 16 because you can get tattooed underage in Indiana, so we just drove over the [Illinois] border. Once I turned 18, I was getting tattooed all the time. I like getting tattooed. There’s something primal about it. No matter where you come from or who your ancestors are, at one point, they were tattooing themselves or marking their bodies or decorating [them]. Tattooing can be really transformative because it’s both immediate and permanent. You walk into a place one way and you walk out different. At 18, I had no inkling I was going to tattoo. I just knew I was obsessed. There’s all these ways you should go about [becoming a tattooer]: Get an apprenticeship, train, have a mentor, etc. I was way too antsy and maybe anti-authority for that. I just had to do it, so I started tattooing my friends. I dropped out of Columbia in 2015. I really liked school—like really, really—but tattooing kind of overtook all my time and energy. I lived at a big, shitty punk house with a million people; I paid, like, $200 a month in rent and split a room. That’s where a lot of my practice came: There’d be some punk band on tour who’d want to get tattoos after the show, so we’d stay up all night partying and tattooing. When I started, I wasn’t thinking of it as a hobby or a career. It felt more like a lifestyle. I just knew that I was gonna be into tattoos forever. If I was making money, if I wasn’t—there was no way I’d stop. I slowly started to get better and meet helpful people. I started to travel a lot, too. I was doing guest spots at different shops across the country. I did a couple really long trips where I packed all my tattoo stuff in my car and drove from, like, Chicago to LA, stopping and tattooing where I could—[working at] random shops where I had a friend from the Internet or a punk house where I knew people. Tattooing used to be really hard to get into. My generation no longer needs the traditional shop structure to make a career. There’s a lot of DIY, underground artists who don’t have to be legitimized in a traditional sense. Not having to go through other people to get your equipment and stuff, people are able to make a living themselves, which I think is cool. There’s bad parts about that, too. Tattooing has a really rich history and beautiful lineage. When you’re disavowing shops or the old ways in general, you’re narrowing your mind. I try to think of Red Devil as a contemporary model where it’s more people who maybe didn’t have the traditional shop apprenticeship, but we are a street shop. We do walk-ins. We’re interested in the people who’ve done it before us and carrying that [spirit] on. One of my biggest influences is [pioneering Filipino American tattooer] Leo Zulueta. I got tattooed by him right before I started tattooing. He’s sort of the godfather of modern tribalism. His style is super fast, punk rock, in-your-face-looking black work, which I’d seen out in the world, but to see it in person totally flipped my lid. The shop was set up different, like the lights were lower [than most studios] and the stuff on the walls was more anthropological photos, people from antiquity or with tattoos all over their faces—tribal tattoos from different cultures. He drew the tattoo right on [my skin] and took his time drawing, erasing, and drawing it again. It was very abstract and tailored to me. I hadn’t experienced any of that before. Sometimes I’d get tattooed at a shop and people would ice me or say something about how I was a “scratcher.” I didn’t really give a fuck. Maybe this is my stubbornness or contrariness or whatever, but if somebody told me not to do something, that made me want to do it more. It gave me a drive to get better. I still have a lot to prove. I don’t know if it’s to myself or other people, but this tattooing thing—it’s endlessly challenging. The realm of possibilities is so big I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface. Your creative and technical ability is always one step behind your vision of the future. I hadn’t put much forethought into starting a shop. I was working at my house for a few years, and then I got a job at [Rogers Park’s Fudo Tattoo], which I loved. I learned a lot from the owner, Dustin Golden. But then I started to feel antsy, and I quit and opened a private tattoo studio in this old warehouse. It was just me, and I really enjoyed it. Then I was bored of that, so I met Miranda and was like, “We should open a walk-in shop.” It was always the plan she’d eventually move back to Texas, and I’d take over. Then this past January, I opened a private studio a couple blocks from the shop. That’s a lot of places to work in ten years, but I think your environment can really dictate your creativity. Changing it is a really good way to open and close chapters of your life. When I started, I was sort of a snot-nosed punk rock kid, like, “Fuck you! I do whatever I want!” Now I have so much more respect for the people who did it before me, all of my favorite tattooers from the 70s, 80s, 90s. All the stuff they were able to accomplish pre-Internet, pre-tattoo television shows, when you had to make your own needles and pigments, and be a good craftsman—it’s unbelievable what they were able to do with the limited technology available to them. My old boss, Dustin, has been building machines since the 2000s. He was the first guy I was around who did that. I’d always struggled with machines. Being self-taught, I had to figure out all that stuff on my own. I was always trying to make them work better or fix them, only to break them and have to get something new. Dustin’s machines were the first ones I even liked. He taught me how he builds them. Having the technical knowledge to troubleshoot issues really changed my tattooing. That’s a lost art now because you can literally order anything you need to tattoo off Amazon and get it in a day. But there’s a real artfulness to getting a machine to look and sound and work exactly how you want. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle because I love people. I love talking to people and working in a city like Chicago, where everyone you tattoo is so different. Touch can be a really beautiful thing in how it connects people. Plus, people will sit in the shop all day and get tattooed next to somebody, and they’re all into it. Maybe none of them would ever have a conversation on the street, but now they’re sort of initiated into this physical, tangible blood ritual that’s quite bizarre. You walk in a grocery store or whatever, and somebody comments on your tattoo—that’s a bridge, too. I still love tattooing as much as when I started. I still get giddy [like] I did when I was 14, tattooing myself in my house. There’s something about it that is so potent to me. It hasn’t lost any of its magic.

The rupee gained 2 paise to close at 88.58 against the US dollar amid strong equity markets and lower crude prices. CareEdge Ratings expects the passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes to grow by around 4% in FY26, driven by GST rationalization, easing inflation, and supportive fiscal measures in the Union Budget 2025–26. The GST cut on small cars (28% to 18%) is likely to revive entry-level demand, which has been under pressure for the last few years while removal of Cess on SUVs will further boost demand. SUVs are expected to continue dominating the market, growing by 8–10% and outpacing overall industry growth. Meanwhile, EV penetration is likely to remain modest at 3–4% while Hybrid volumes could grow by 34-38% in FY26, reaching ~1.07–1.10 lakh units, up from ~80,406 units (registered) in FY25. Madhusudhan Goswami, Assistant Director, CareEdge Ratings said, “GST rate cut coinciding with robust consumer sentiment in the festive season led to PV registrations reaching an all-time monthly high in October 2025. GST rate cut led to improved affordability, especially for the first-time PV owner. Also, robust growth in retail sales was observed across rural and urban markets. Going forward, with the end of festival season, PV sales is expected to normalize, however, growth momentum is expected to sustain due to upcoming harvest season boosting rural demand along-with seasonal demand from weddings.” The PV industry recorded healthy growth of 7.4% in FY24, which moderated to 3.7% in FY25, in line with CareEdge Ratings’ expectations. This slowdown was primarily due to the levelling off of pent-up demand, higher vehicle prices, and the high base effect of previous years. Despite these challenges, new model launches and strong SUV demand sustained overall momentum. Utility vehicle (UV) volumes grew 21.8% in FY24 and 14.0% in FY25, supported by a robust order book and rising preference for SUVs. In contrast, passenger car volumes declined 8.5% in FY24 and 11.5% in FY25, reflecting subdued entry-level demand and a structural shift toward SUVs. In a move that underscores the rising expectations for security and compliance across Web3, Polygon has officially listed Cyberscope, a subsidiary of TAC InfoSec Limited (NSE: TAC), as the first Smart Contract Audit company in the Polygon Ecosystem. The listing appears under the “Tools” category — placing Cyberscope alongside the foundational infrastructure powering thousands of decentralized applications on one of the world’s most scalable blockchain networks. For TAC InfoSec Limited, this marks another decisive step in its global Web3 expansion strategy — one that industry analysts say could materially influence the company’s audit volumes, revenue mix, and market leadership as blockchain security becomes a top-line concern for developers and investors. People familiar with the matter estimate that the Polygon integration could drive 400–500 new project engagements annually, of which 320–350 are expected to convert into full smart contract audits, supplemented by 60–80 KYC verifications. The demand pipeline is tied to the rapid growth of Polygon’s ecosystem and the increasing pressure on emerging Web3 teams to meet institutional-grade compliance norms. 360 ONE Asset has announced the appointment of Pritam Doshi as Chief Investment Officer and Head - Renewable Energy.

Extreme fear, record ETF outflows, and a brief slip of the futures curve into backwardation underscored the depth of the move. Yet several structural indicators are turning supportive, liquidation clusters are building in the $85K–$90K region, and short-term holder capitulation is nearing exhaustion. Together, they point toward a maturing correction phase rather than the start of a deeper bear cycle. Bitcoin’s asymmetric reaction to equity weakness also mirrors patterns historically seen around macro lows. Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s slide. Ethereum’s 20% monthly decline has driven its Mayer Multiple below 1, a zone that has repeatedly marked long-term accumulation ranges. Liquidity pockets near $2,900–$2,760 may still induce short-term volatility before a base settles. Solana and XRP recovered modestly on the week, but exchange reserves and open interest trends show broad deleveraging across majors rather than exit-driven selling. With sentiment compressed and risk premiums elevated, the market is operating inside a technical pocket that has often preceded reflexive rebounds once macro drivers stabilise. Our advice: The market is showing signs that the worst of the selling may be behind us, but it is still early to call a turn. Liquidations around $85K to $90K and cooling capitulation tell us sellers are tiring, yet we need spot strength to confirm it. Stay light, avoid leverage, and let the market show stability before adding risk. Stick with BTC and ETH for now, and treat altcoins as short, tactical trades until liquidity improves.” Hindustan Copper informed exchanges that an accident at Malanjkhand Copper Project at Balaghat District of Madhya Pradesh (a unit of Hindustan Copper Ltd) led to the demise of one contractual employee engaged by a mining contractor.

With its dominant market position at 57% in clean air for Indian commercial trucks and 52% in passenger vehicle shock absorbers, it is well-positioned in this market driven by BS-VI compliance and regulatory tailwinds.

Thanks & Regards, Kunal Sodhani (Beast) (Personal view) Indian government bonds are expected to trade in a tight range early on Wednesday, with sentiment likely to remain subdued as buying from a key investor category, which includes the central bank, slumped in the previous session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note may drift between 6.50% and 6.55%, a trader at a primary dealership said, after ending at 6.5258% on Tuesday. Purchases from the “others” category, which includes the Reserve Bank of India, plummeted to about 2 billion rupees ($22.58 million), compared with a daily average of 50 billion rupees in the week ended November 7 when the central bank returned to secondary market purchases of bonds after a gap of six months, CCIL data showed. The RBI’s buying earlier this month had raised hopes that the demand–supply balance in the market would improve. The recent drop in volumes has now reinforced traders’ conviction that the purchases were largely to replace maturing holdings, rather than to send a signal for lower yields. “No buying from the others category is negative for bonds, but any further news on India’s inclusion in global indices will support the market,” a trader at a private bank said. The 10-year yield eased about 2 basis points on Tuesday, after local media reports suggested India’s chances of inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index had improved, traders said. Focus is also on the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes due after market hours on Wednesday, for cues on the U.S. rate-easing trajectory. India's equity benchmarks are set to open flat amid subdued global sentiment and investor caution ahead of key economic data.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

Full Content:
Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition has a download size of 27.3GB on Switch 2 and 27.1GB on Switch. Both versions of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition cost $20--there's no surcharge on Switch 2--and there's a special 10% launch discount through November 24. Not only that, but there's also a stackable loyalty discount for people who own the Tomb Raider remasters on Switch. So if you have Tomb Raider VI-VI Remastered, for example, you get an additional 10% off for 20% off total. And then another 10% can be added by owning Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. Developer Crystal Dynamics is currently busy working on the next Tomb Raider game, with Amazon serving as publisher. However, Crystal Dynamics has seen multiple rounds of layoffs this year, and Microsoft canceled the Perfect Dark reboot--another project the team was developing. Meanwhile, a new trailer premiered earlier today on X for Season 2 of Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft animated series. There is no word on whether the rest of the Survivor trilogy will head to Switch and Switch 2. For more, check out GameSpot's Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition review.

Title: Layoff notices flared in October across much of U.S., Fed report shows

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 12:16 PM EST / CBS News Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs. It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Layoff notices across the 21 states tracked by the Cleveland Fed reached a peak of more than 550,000 in March 2020. Major companies including Target, Amazon and UPS have announced rounds of job cuts in recent weeks, with some economists noting that the labor market appears to be weakening. The record-long government shutdown has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions. Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while ADP data released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1. Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come. Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a Monday email that they expect layoffs to pick up next year amid wider AI adoption, while noting that the technology has had a "net positive impact" on the labor market so far this year. The delayed September employment report, which will be released Thursday, will provide another barometer on the health of the U.S. labor market. Economists polled by financial data provider FactSet predict payroll gains of 50,000. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: UK’s Pulse Films to end TV content production as parent company Vice Studios makes redundancies

Pulse Films was behind Gangs of London for Sky and AMC Gangs of London maker Pulse Films is to stop production of TV and film content after parent company Vice Studios Group made a number of layoffs in the UK. The celebrated scripted prodco, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has made shows such as Netflix factual hit The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann and Sky action series Atomic, will now make only branded content, music videos and commercials. According to reports by Deadline, Vice has made layoffs in Pulse’s London headquarters, with all future scripted projects – such as a fourth season of Sky/AMC gangster series Gangs of London – to now be taken over by Vice Studios in LA. Vice Studios Group co-president Jamie Hall last week was named the new scripted MD for BBC Studios Productions, with the former Pulse Films chief operating officer and president of scripted TV set to take up his new role in January 2026. Vice Studios is led by former Amazon and Paramount executive Amy Powell, who was named president in May. In August, Vice raised US$75m via a new credit facility led by Western Alliance Bank, with plans to use the funds to support content investment through Vice Studios. The company said the credit facility was part of a larger five-year, US$500m investment in developing and producing scripted and unscripted content for TV, streaming and digital. Pulse was impacted in 2022 by the departures of founders and CEOs Thomas Benski and Marisa Clifford, who stepped down after 16 years at the prodco. Their departure came six years after the pair, who founded Pulse Films in 2005, sold a controlling interest to Vice Media Group. Benski subsequently joined forces with French actor Omar Sy (Lupin) and Hollywood director Louis Leterrier to launch scripted outfit Carrousel Studios in 2024, as well as rolling out talent- and IP-led media group and venture capital firm Lumina late last year. In September, Lumina made a seven-figure investment in creator-first UK management group Arcade, which represents YouTube collective The Sidemen.

Now, he is bringing his management skills to an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up with fewer than 100 employees. Project Prometheus, which Mr Bezos co-founded with scientist Vik Bajaj, will use AI to accelerate engineering and manufacturing in fields like aerospace and cars, The New York Times reported. The start-up has US$6.2 billion (S$8 billion) in funding, sourced in part from Mr Bezos himself, and employees counted in the dozens, some of whom were poached from leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. As co-CEO with Mr Bajaj, Mr Bezos is back in a formal executive post for the first time since stepping down from Amazon in 2021. The billionaire has since devoted time to his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and made headlines for his personal life, including a star-studded wedding in Venice in 2025. Mr Bezos has also more closely aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s administration, attending his inauguration in January and ordering a pro-business revamp of the opinion page at the Washington Post, the news media outlet he owns. Project Prometheus enters a crowded AI market dominated by tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, alongside pioneering firms OpenAI and Anthropic. The venture is part of a broader trend towards applying AI to physical tasks, often using robotics. Unlike the generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, it aims to develop systems that learn from real-world experimentation, rather than just digital text, with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery in physics, chemistry and engineering. Another dramatic shift since Mr Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 is the rise of AI-native start-ups built around ultra-lean teams – a reversal of the old playbook that equated headcount expansion with business growth. When Mr Bezos left the CEO seat at Amazon, he oversaw more than 1.6 million employees. On the company’s most recent earnings call, current CEO Andy Jassy attributed thousands of recent layoffs to ongoing efforts to eliminate layers of bureaucracy after years of over-hiring. Some parts of Mr Bezos’ philosophies may require a reboot for the AI era. His preference for lengthy memos with narratives indicating deep thinking by the author may be outdated now that workers can use generative AI tools to do the writing for them. But his Darwinian approach to work culture jibes with what is expected now at many of the hottest AI start-ups. And some of his management ideals, like keeping teams lean and fast and making them exceptionally talent-dense, will arguably never go out of style. When Mr Bezos stepped down after 27 years of running Amazon, he was widely lauded as one of the best CEOs in tech history. If his new start-up succeeds, it will likely come down in part to how relevant his management philosophy still is – or how much it has evolved.

Title: Dutta Dismantles the Fed's Rate-Hold Case
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/11/17/dutta-ends-the-fed/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T19:26:30Z
Full Content:
Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

Title: Major MMO Is Coming To Steam With A $50 Alpha Test, Which Is Actually A Discount

Ashes of Creation could be the next big MMO, if it ever releases in full. By Cameron Koch on November 17, 2025 at 9:32AM PST Indie MMORPG Ashes of Creation, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to Steam. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50. That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation website. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam. Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play. Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ. "Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states. Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from. "Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players." Ashes of Creation ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to pay $500 for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--one set in the Warhammer universe and another called project Ghost led by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street. Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of active development on its MMO New World, which once had more than 900,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO. It was, strangely, not the first time that has happened. A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of cigarettes and other tobacco-related products. This stock offers value investors a compelling entry point, along with a generous dividend yield of 7.09%. Altria manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. The company’s dividend payout is based on free cash flow, ranging from about 64% to 80% per quarter. In recent quarters, free cash flow has exceeded dividend payments, providing a solid buffer. Altria generates strong cash flow from its core tobacco business, which provides a stable base, albeit with regulatory risk, and yields are among the highest in the S&P 500, at least for now. The company primarily sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand, as well as: It sells its tobacco products primarily to wholesalers, including distributors and large retail organizations, such as chain stores. Altria used to own over 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A. (NYSE: BUD), the world’s largest brewer. Last year, the company sold 35 million of its 197 million shares through a global secondary offering. That represents 18% of its holdings but still leaves 8% of the outstanding shares in its back pocket. Altria also announced a $2.4 billion stock repurchase plan partially funded by the sale. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a $72 target price. Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) owns one of the largest portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States. It is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that pays a solid 8.15% monthly dividend and stands out in the market with its unique offering. The company has 224 hotels with more than 30,066 guest rooms across 87 markets in 37 states, plus one property leased to third parties. Its hotel portfolio includes 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels. They are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, including: Apple Hospitality hotels are in various states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, and others. Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating with a target price of $14. This top master limited partnership is one of North America’s largest and most diversified midstream energy companies. Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE: ET) is a safe option for investors seeking energy exposure and income, as the company pays a substantial 7.91% distribution. It owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. It has a strategic footprint in all the major domestic oil and gas production basins. Energy Transfer operates one of the largest integrated midstream systems in the U.S., with nearly 107,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 235 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of storage capacity. Its strong presence in Texas, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides it with access to some of the country’s most affordable natural gas. The company is receiving significant inquiries for pipeline projects to serve power plants (45 plants across 11 states) and data centers (over 40 prospective projects), with potential demand exceeding 5 Bcf/d for power plants and 3 Bcf/d for data centers.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.
