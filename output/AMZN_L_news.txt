As Paramount and Amazon undergo a fresh round of cuts, creators are offering new opportunities Boo! Did I scare you? Well if I didn’t, the state of Hollywood right now probably will. This past week has been a rough one. On Tuesday, Amazon announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs to keep up with this “generation of AI,” layoffs which impacted the company’s video games and publishing divisions. And then there’s Paramount. As part of the company’s new cost-cutting strategy under David Ellison, Paramount will reportedly be laying off 2,000 employees in the coming weeks. But as bleak as these axings are, there is one area that’s hiring. Yep, it’s the creator economy. From 2022 to 2024, Los Angeles employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, workers in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. As the creator space has gotten bigger, its biggest players have created their own media companies. These businesses are often created with the goal of expanding a creator’s audience and turning their reach and popularity into a more passive and sustainable revenue stream. To make that happen, a lot of these creators have been turning to Hollywood alum. And at the pace some of these creators are moving, they need good experienced people, stat. Take Sean Atkins, the president and CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, who originally came from MTV and Discovery. There’s also Corie Henson, the former head of NBC unscripted TV who moved to Beast Studios. As I’ve spoken to more creators, there seems to be a shift from solely recruiting other digitally-native personnel to bringing in people with more experience in traditional media. Or as one high-ranking creator exec told me, “They’re looking to add adults to the room.” This broadening doesn’t just apply to creator-made companies. There’s also been a boom of companies designed to support creators like Kajabi and Raptive on the tools and strategy side; Night and Digital Brand Architects on the agency side; and QYOU Media on the advertising side. If these companies haven’t already started hiring from film and television pools, they’re at least talking about it. G&B Digital Management, a creator-focused management company founded by Kyle Hjelmeseth, even hosts workshops to help actors, crew members and creatives in traditional media pivot to the creator economy. The next one is coming to Brooklyn on Nov. 12. This isn’t meant to sugarcoat a truly sucky week. Thousands of talented people are getting booted from their jobs. And the ones who are still lucky to be employed are either panicking about their futures (hello Warner Bros. Discovery!) or are spread so thin they can barely breathe. But amid all the horror, there is a small sliver of hope. Now onto the rest. Kayla Cobb Senior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com IShowSpeed freaks out over AI deepfakes MrBeast isn’t the only mega creator panicking over the state of AI. During a livestream last week, IShowSpeed (45 million YouTube subscribers) watched several deepfake videos of himself generated by Sora 2, OpenAI’s latest model. Speed admitted that giving the app permission to use his likeness publicly was a mistake and said, “Whoever told me to make it public, chat, you’re not here for my own safety, bro. I’m f–ked.” So he’s not a fan. Tubi ups its creator bets with Hartbeat and Audiochuck Tubi, the free ad-supported streamer owned by Fox, upped its creator investments in two major ways this week. First up is a deal with Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat for four movies, the streamer’s first exclusive deal for creator content. Two of the upcoming movies will come from Kinigra Deon (5.5 million YouTube subscribers) and 85 South Show (3.4 million Instagram followers). That was on Wednesday. On Thursday, Tubi announced a multiyear deal worth $150 million with Audiochuck, the media company from Ashley Flowers that’s behind “Crime Junkie,” “The Deck” and “So Supernatural.” As part of the deal, Tubi will have exclusive distribution and advertising sales rights and will develop a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel. No wonder Tubi got so many shoutouts during this quarter’s earnings call. NASCAR and Night partner on creator-focused series with TimTheTatman, Emiru and more NASCAR is tapping creators as part of its effort to expand to younger audiences. The upcoming Creator Series, launched in partnership with the digital talent agency Night, will be hosted by NASCAR analyst Mamba Smith and will see professional driver Carson Hocevar race alongside eight top creators. The creators taking the wheel include: The four-event series will run through October through February and will be available to watch across Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. TikTok creators can earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions During TikTok’s Creator Summit, the company announced creators can now earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions. As the name implies, subscriptions let fans can gain access to paywalled content from TikTok creators. The platform also introduced two new AI-powered tools. Smart Split automatically edits longer content into multiple shortform videos. Then there’s AI Outline, which helps creators generate video titles, hashtags, hooks and outlines for their videos. Netflix is experimenting with vertical videos but swears it’s not competing with TikTok At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Netflix Chief Technology Officer Elizabeth Stone said the company is starting to experiment with more vertical videos, which is home to shortform content. But Stone promised the company isn’t trying to compete with TikTok or the emerging shortform drama trend. Remember when Netflix promised it wasn’t going to have ads? Or it wasn’t going to invest in live sports? Or when it swore “Stranger Things” wasn’t coming to theaters earlier this month? So sure, Netflix. YouTube partners with Adobe, settles Disney lawsuit It was a big week for YouTube. As part of Adobe’s new slate of AI toolsfor creators, the company announced a partnership that will add a Create for YouTube Shorts option to the app version of Premiere (I’ve been trying it out, and that platform is seriously awesome). YouTube also announced a series of updates to optimize watching videos in the living room. In the past year, YouTube channels earning six-figure paydays from TV viewership increased by 45%. YouTube and Disney also settled their ongoing legal feud over Justin Connolly, the former Disney employee who’s now YouTube’s global head of media and sports. Oh, and Alphabet posted its first $100 BILLION quarter. Very casual, guys. Steven Bartlett’s company backed by Slow Ventures at a $425 million valuation Slow Ventures and Apeiron Investment Group backed Steven Bartlett’s company Steven.com at a $425 million valuation. Bartlett is behind the podcast “Diary of a CEO,” which has 13 million subscribers on YouTube and is routinely included on lists of the most listened to and watched podcasts. The exact investment amount hasn’t been disclosed. By the way, Kamala Harris stopped by Bartlett’s podcast today. Shorthand Studios hires BuzzFeed alum Zack Evans You know how at the top I said creator companies are looking to hire Hollywood talent? They’re also looking at media alum. Case in point Zack Evans, the BuzzFeed and Cameo alum who was just hired as Shorthand Studios’ VP of creative strategy. Shorthand Studios is the content and production studio under Underscore Talent. Kaya Yurieff and Jasmine Enberg launch Scalable to cover the business of the creator economy The Information’s former creator expert Kaya Yurieff is going off on her own. On Thursday, Yurieff and eMarketer alum Jasmine Enberg announced the launch of Scalable, their new venture dedicated to covering the business of the creator economy. Scalable will be partnering with The Lighthouse, Whalar Group’s creator campus. Stapleview “SNL” may wanna watch its back because Stapleview’s content has been crushing it lately. A comedy collective for up-and-coming comedians, Stapleview (198,000 TikTok followers) has already launched several internet shows like “Ad World” and “Clear the Air with Taylor Ortega.” But its latest batch of sketches have been on fire. It’s also the company behind Grace Reiter’s (3.4 million TikTok followers) “That’s Enough” podcast. Reiter is great on her own, but there’s something magical happening right now with Stapleview’s full comedy lineup. Want more? Explore WrapPRO now.

Title: ESRT Closes Q3 2025 With Strong Fundamentals But Muted Leasing Numbers

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) reported an increase in visitors to its eponymous building, along with fewer leases in the third quarter of 2025 as its portfolio reaches critical capacity. Net operating income from the observatory at the Empire State Building saw a modest increase to $26.5 million — up slightly compared to $24.1 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis — but it still hasn’t reached the $28.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, the real estate investment trust said Thursday. The decrease in visitations has been attributed to tourism being negatively impacted by international politics, according to ESRT. Leasing velocity across its entire portfolio, both retail and office, was down from 232,108 square feet in the second quarter to 87,880 square feet in the quarter ending Sept. 30. ESRT explained to investors during an earnings call that the drop was due to its available spaces reaching capacity. In the third quarter, ESRT’s notable lease deals included a 19,883-square-foot renewal and expansion for Jencap Group at 1350 Broadway, and a 16,402-square-foot renewal for Haver Analytics at One Grand Central Place. Occupancy increased 80 basis points to 90.3 percent across its Manhattan portfolio. ESRT reported 150,000 square feet of leases currently in negotiation, and 500,000 square feet of Manhattan office vacancies. “We have less space to lease, and a portion of our Manhattan office vacancy is held off-market in connection with our assemblage of large block opportunities at several properties in response to market demand, which will provide strong long-term results,” an ESRT spokesperson said. ESRT’s portfolio is optimized to protect against possible market contraction through layoffs at big companies like Amazon — which just cut its headcount by 14,000 people — according to ESRT Chairman Tony Malkin, who emphasized that he is in talks with enough potential new tenants that he does not see the job market being an immediate cause of concern. “Everybody we speak with comes to us for the quality of our portfolio, and several of them have migrated from what would be thought of as glass and steel buildings,” Malkin said. “We still have ongoing expansion within our portfolio from existing tenants. There are all kinds of reasons people might not expand, but we don’t see any of them playing out right now.” Funds from operations was 23 cents per diluted share compared to 26 cents in the third quarter of 2024, which equates to about $61.2 million compared to $69.2 million, respectively, over the same periods. Malkin reiterated his agnostic stance on politics, specifically in terms of how leasing could be impacted by the presumptive victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Nov. 4 mayoral election. “We do policy, not politics,” Malkin said. “So whoever shows up, whatever administration arrives, that’s the one with which we deal, and that’s where we try to both contribute to policy and do our best work from a business perspective.” But in a more direct address to the question of whether the market is vulnerable to policies from a Democratic Socialist mayor, Malkin said he is confident that the New York City market will continue to be what it has always been to people looking to build a business and a career. “New York City has and continues to be a magnet for the job-seeking college graduates, folks who want to come and make their careers and live in a vibrant environment,” Malkin said. “And by the way, those are an awful lot of today’s voters. They are the employees. The employers are here because they want those employees.” Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Amazon Ads Business Jumps 24% From Prior Year to $17.7 Billion

$33 billion: How much Amazon made in the third quarter from its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services—up 20% year-over-year and beating analyst projections. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. $17.7 billion: How much Amazon made from advertising in the second quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year. 13%: The amount that Amazon’s total net sales increased compared to last year’s Q3 earnings, to $180.2 billion. $1.8 billion: What Amazon expects to pay in severance fees related to layoffs, which started this week when the company announced cuts of around 14,000 corporate jobs. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal both reported that the total number of affected jobs is expected to hit 30,000. -69%: The drop in Amazon’s free cash flow—down to $14.8 billion versus the $47.7 billion reported in Q3 last year—largely due to capital investments related to artificial intelligence. 60%: Increase in the number of rural communities that have access to Amazon’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery over the last four months. 250 million: How many people have used Rufus, Amazon’s generative AI shopping assistant, so far this year. The company claims people who use Rufus are 60% more likely to complete a purchase. $2.5 billion: The settlement Amazon had to pay this quarter after the FTC proved it misled people and made it exceedingly difficult to cancel subscriptions. CEO Andy Jassy kicked off Amazon’s Q3 earnings call by discussing AWS, the company’s cloud-computing business, noting that the 20% growth rate is a return to a pace the company hasn’t seen since 2022. He also teased “several” new AWS deals signed in October that haven’t yet been announced. “AWS is where the preponderance of companies data and workloads reside, and part of why most companies want to run AI on AWS,” Jassy said. The AWS growth numbers outpaced analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares jumped as much as 14% in after-hours trading. The company still has more demand for AWS services than it has capacity for, however. Currently, the bottleneck is in power, Jassy said, though it could at some point shift to chips. Amazon has added 3.8 gigawatts of power to its AWS infrastructure in the last year, with another gigawatt coming in Q4. For its advertising division, Amazon highlighted deals with Netflix, Spotify, and SiriusXM. The ads business saw 24% growth from the year prior, to $17.7 billion in revenue. Agentic commerce is coming. While it’s become very easy to buy things online when you know what you want, a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages over ecommerce when you don’t know exactly what you want, Jassy explained in response to an investor question about agentic. But that’s going to change as AI agents get better at guiding online shopping experiences, he said. “AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online,” Jassy said. “That’s really good for customers, and I think it’s really good for Amazon, because at the end of the day, you’re going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably.” Kathryn Lundstrom is ADWEEK’s commerce and sustainability editor.

Title: The Great VC Reshuffle: OpenAI’s $500B Restructuring, A16z’s $10B Mega-Fund, and Why Two-Thirds of Series B Investments Fail

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back!! 20VC x SaaStr with Harry, Rory and Jason! Bottom Line Up Front: Three seismic shifts hit venture this week. OpenAI completed the most significant corporate restructuring in tech history, clearing the path for a potential $2 trillion IPO while Sam Altman keeps zero equity. Andreessen Horowitz raised $10 billion—but when you break down the individual funds, they’re more beatable than the headlines suggest. And new data proves what great investors always knew: two-thirds of Series B investments return less than 2x, making picking more critical than ever. Meanwhile, companies like Mercor hit $500M in revenue in record time, and the debate over when founders should sell intensifies as regulatory risk reshapes M&A. The big news this week: OpenAI successfully cut deals with Microsoft, Delaware, and California attorneys general to implement their long-awaited restructuring. They’re now a proper public benefit corporation (PBC)—similar to Patagonia—with a $135 billion charitable foundation owning roughly 20%, Microsoft owning 27%, and employees owning another 20%+. What This Actually Means: The most shocking detail? Sam Altman will have zero equity in the restructured entity. Think about that for a moment—we’re simultaneously watching Elon Musk argue for a trillion-dollar pay package while the CEO of OpenAI owns nothing in a $500 billion company. Jason Lemkin noted the absurdity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll explained the power dynamics: “It gives him in some ways more power as well as less power. You can’t assail the man for capitalism when his other billion-dollar entities are the ones that let him finish off the McLaren collection.” Microsoft emerges as a clear winner, turning their $13 billion investment into a 10x return with ongoing revenue share and Azure contracts. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” The charitable foundation also wins big—$135 billion is, as O’Driscoll put it, “a significant contribution to whatever good they hopefully will do with that money. There’s $135 billion out there that’s not going into someone’s pockets to buy yachts, boats and football teams. It’s actually going to try and solve world’s problems.” He added the historical perspective: “I would have laughed in 2016 at the people who started OpenAI saying we want to do good for the world. But at a big picture level they succeeded—they built something worth $130 billion which is a foundation that they can be proud of.” Here’s where it gets interesting for founders and investors: OpenAI now has a clear path to what could be the most popular retail IPO in history. Lemkin was direct: “I just can’t think of a retail IPO that would be more popular than OpenAI. Just bringing everyone out of the woodwork to put a little bit of their life savings into it—to ignore even if the valuation makes no sense. This would have to be the most popular retail IPO of all time, right?” O’Driscoll agreed: “I think you’re exactly right. People aren’t going to be reading the prospectus and saying maybe we won’t make profits. They’re not going to be reading the thing about $250 billion of cloud commits to third parties. They’re just going to be like, let me get some of that OpenAI.” Current math: At $500 billion with roughly $12 billion in revenue, they’re trading at ~40x revenue. O’Driscoll broke down the trajectory: “At even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion… It’s kind of, you know, 40 times gap and if it’s 20 billion it’s 25 times AR run rate. My guess is it would take two years in the normal course but you might see that euphoria moment. It’s within the trajectory, it’s within the strike zone if anything like the current growth rate continues.” But he added the critical caveat: “If you’re trading at 40 times revenues and your growth rate slows, it’s nasty and you fall sheer.” Lemkin pointed out another crucial advantage: “This unlocks maybe four times more equity for them potentially if the public markets are different than the private because of the potential valuation they could IPO. They may need that—they may need an extra 200 billion to go the distance.” O’Driscoll noted the banker feeding frenzy to come: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak and calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Everyone’s talking about a16z’s massive $10 billion fundraise, but when you break down the funds, it’s actually more reasonable than the headline suggests: Lemkin had the contrarian take: “I thought they were small. And what I mean is I didn’t think it was small until I saw the breakdown of the funds. At first when we talked about this before, I’m like 10 billion—that’s unprecedented. But when I look at that and the new Sequoia fund, $200 million Sequoia seed fund—that’s not that big compared to 20 VC… 1.5 billion for AI apps when you’re investing in 11 labs and friends and Replit doesn’t seem to get you very far.” He continued: “When you break apart the funds, I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has. And I don’t think one and a half billion for their AI app funds—I think it’s only twice the scale. So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” The Red Army Strategy O’Driscoll provided the big picture: “Andre Andreessen Horowitz is the red army of the venture industry now. They got the 10 billion and they’re going to march it forward. The amount of self-knowledge embodied in that is stunning. There’s one of my favorite expressions from the Russian Red Army which is quantity has a quality all its own. In other words, when you want to take Berlin, at some point what you do is you just get two million people willing to die and you march them forward.” But he also acknowledged the scale advantages: “It’s not of course it’s 10 billion. It’s 10 billion of 30% carry and 10 billion of 2% fees and 10 billion of all this. The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Harry Stebbings added the structural insight: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity.” O’Driscoll explained the optionality advantage: “You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. If you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high. The more bankroll you have to build up option value… the more option value you have at the back end because you have a $10 trillion fund, the easier it is to spray because you can amortize the cost of the losses over the one winner.” Stebbings noted the LP dynamic most don’t understand: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” O’Driscoll summed it up: “Bundling and rent extraction is fully understood.” While everyone obsesses over foundation models, Mercor quietly hit $500 million in revenue faster than any company in history—just 17 months to reach that milestone. They’re now valued at $10 billion, up from $2 billion just eight months ago. What They Actually Do: O’Driscoll explained the business: “They provide humans with specialist knowledge to—and their customers are the large foundation model companies—and what they do is they bring this human talent to bear to help the foundation model companies train the models by providing human feedback. You people would have heard RLHF—reinforcement learning through human feedback—these are the humans that do that.” He continued: “If I’m OpenAI and I want to teach my latest model how to do advanced math, what I need is a whole bunch of doctorates and PhDs who understand math that are available to pose questions to the model, judge model questions, give feedback on which answer is correct. By doing that, you effectively—by giving this human feedback—I think of it as you pound the model into submission where it eventually says, ‘Okay, I’ve learned this shit by adjusting the weights.'” The evolution is stunning: “Five years ago, we were labeling cats. And you had people often overseas charged with labeling cats and not getting a lot of money. I think Mercor realized that the market today is not labeling cats. It’s in fact answering complex physics questions, math questions, bio questions because the models know how to label cats now and what they need to do is the outer edges of human knowledge.” The Bull Case: Stebbings broke down the expanding value proposition: “It all started with talent acquisition—if you got the talent and could provide it, fantastic. We’ll pay you. Pillar two is get the talent, now we want data acquisition—you provide it to us, not we extract it. And you measure the quality of it too. And now we’re adding the third pillar, which is the implementation layer—we expect you to implement it efficiently and make sure our models get off the ground more effectively. And with that, you also see increased pricing and the willingness to spend much, much more from the model providers.” O’Driscoll on the growth opportunity: “The growth isn’t surprising because if you think about it, these model companies have grown faster than any company in human history. They’re spending $400 billion on compute. They’re probably spending $4 billion dollars on RLHF and they were spending zero five years ago. It’s an explosive growth market.” The Bear Case: But Stebbings identified the concentration risk: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue. So there is real revenue concentration there. It’s high quality customers but you do have that dynamic as well.” O’Driscoll was even more direct on the structural challenges: “Your margin profile is not amazing because the gross revenue is 500 million but you give 70% of it to the doctors and the mathematicians who are doing all whatever it is—some percentage I’m not going to speculate—and then the second fact you have against you is massive customer concentration. And at some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million,’ right?” He concluded with the ultimate framing: “From a long-term value extraction perspective, you prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two. When you look at those positives and negatives, this is fundamentally a bet that the AI capex train will keep running for two or three or four more years.” Lemkin added the timeline caveat: “OpenAI is not going to focus on getting efficient until it’s dealt with hyperrowth. So as long as it’s not getting efficient, you probably can lean in. If it slows down, then the positives—which is the growth rate—goes away and then all the negatives come back to bite you.” On the valuation at $10 billion with $500M revenue, Stebbings noted: “It’s only 20 times revenue. So like it doesn’t seem—this is where actually we’re seeing revenue compression.” But O’Driscoll provided the sobering underwriting math: “You should be underwriting anything to a 3x. So you got to be 30 billion to make it worth your while and 30 billion… at even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion. You’re underwriting a lot of training data.” Ramp raising again at $30 billion (up from $23 billion) prompted questions about whether constant fundraising is now just part of the playbook. Why The Skepticism: Lemkin was blunt: “To me, going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough. Let’s say I was a seed investor, I’ve probably had a token of dilution. So let’s imagine I’m down to 2%, which would be great. I have a $400 million position at the last round. Right now, it’s worth $480 million with dilution after this next round. I mean, it’s a lot, but it’s not doubling my position like a classic round is.” He continued: “These little rounds—22, 25, 30—and with a lot of AI companies, a lot of dilution or a lot of others, you could see 10% annual dilution in these companies or more. You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share. It’s possible. I just don’t really care about these micro step-ups that look great—you’re like 30 billion—well if the last round was at 10, impressive. If the last round’s at three like Mercor, impressive. Here I’m like, meh, that’s cute.” Why It Makes Sense: O’Driscoll explained the capital needs: “There does appear to be a combination of insane demand for the stock, an ability to use that to create this aura of inevitability. And this is more than most companies—this is one where constant growth requires lots of capital because you’re in a capital advancing business. So you probably have every dollar you add of revenue takes $5 of capital because you got to finance purchases—you’re effectively recreating Amex. So it may well be that there’s a larger demand for capital here than the average deal.” On the valuation progression, he noted: “Someone’s lending you $4 billion of that, they’re probably going to want a $1 billion equity cushion. Going from 23 billion to 30 billion… let’s say I was a seed investor with 2%—I have a $400 million position at the last round, right now it’s worth $480 million with dilution.” The Public vs Private Debate: O’Driscoll made a critical distinction: “Another spin on what you’re saying is with the exception of the new AI companies, that probably is the kind of IRR you should expect to get in a mature growth private company. There’s really early and late stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public, could just as easily be a small midcap stock at this point in time public.” He continued: “You don’t expect midcap stocks to gap up 3x in a year—you expect the overall market will go by 11%, the best companies grow 30-40% year-on-year. There’s no reason to assume that the return to the stock should be different just because it’s held in a different corporate structure. The company is the company independent if it’s public or private.” Lemkin countered: “You just said we’re still underwriting Harry asked you what we’re underwriting to. You said at least 3x. So if I’m going to underwrite to 3x and I did the last Ramp round at 23, it’s not really getting me to my 3x.” O’Driscoll clarified: “You’re confusing your pronouns. You’re trying to underwrite to a 3x. If you’re running money doing companies at 30 billion pre, you’re probably not underwriting to an overall 3x on your fund. I don’t think you are underwriting to a 3x when you’re doing ultra late stage billion-dollar revenue run rate $30 billion valuations and you’re definitely not underwriting to a 30% IRR.” New data from Carter looked at all 547 Series B investments from 2018. The results are sobering for anyone who thinks picking doesn’t matter. The Distribution: The Math: O’Driscoll analyzed the data: “If you hit those three buckets correctly, the blended return—I know it from our fund model—is 3.7x gross, 3x net to the LP. So if you look at that business, if you get enough slots in the buckets, right, in each of the buckets—the good buckets, the 5x bucket and the 10x bucket—you end up with a 3x net to the LP. So the first piece of good news is if you do it right, the return was available to you.” But he emphasized the picking challenge: “Jason picked on the negative which is two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. And what it says is picking is so important because if you skew instead of 66%, if you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” The Brutal Truth About Series B: Only 1 in 3 Deals Even Double Investors’ Money, Per Latest Carta Data Does Spray and Pray Work? Lemkin disagreed with the spray characterization: “At series B, everyone thinks they’re a great picker, don’t they? This isn’t pre-seed. Everyone’s a great picker at series B, right?” O’Driscoll responded: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. I think if you don’t pick, if you’re not a good picker, you will end up with more… If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off. I don’t think the spray and pray strategy would work here.” He identified three distinct strategies: “There’s actually three approaches. There’s picking, there’s spraying, and then the third one which someone big like Andre can do which is optioning. You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. But if you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high.” On the a16z seed strategy with 72 seed bets (compared to number two at 27), Stebbings noted: “Exactly to your point there, Rory, you said you can’t win without being a great picker. I’m not saying Andre are not great pickers, but you can if you have 72 option bets.” O’Driscoll agreed: “There are three strategies. There’s spraying, picking, and optioning. Optioning allows you to spray more. Once upon a time, you thought seed was all about option value and anything beyond that wasn’t. Because we’re dealing with gargantuan sums of money, it is now plausible that for some people A’s and B’s are partially options. If you’re going to deploy $200 million in the growth round, you don’t want to be totally slipshod at the A and the B, but you can think of it as more option value. That’s absolutely a superpower that a wall of money gives you.” Even at Seed: On whether spray works at seed, O’Driscoll did the math: “Going back to the Carter data, there were 547 series B’s in 2018. I’m going to guess graduation rate probably implies 800 A’s. That probably implies 1,600 seeds. So even what you are pejoratively calling spray and pray is doing 50 deals out of 1,600. There’s still a huge element of picking involved in that.” He identified the only exception: “The only people on the planet who have a structural business where they can de-emphasize picking because they can write checks—option checks at scale—is Y Combinator because they have a structured advantage in terms of their economics. They are the only people who’ve built a mass production seed business.” On why even the single best outcome doesn’t justify true spray: “It’ll always be true that if you pick the single largest outlier in any vintage—like if one of those deals was Figma where the B made 100x—even if it’s 300x, if you did an index and did every deal equally, it’s only a 0.2x. If you put a dollar into everything, your Figma check doesn’t return the fund. Maybe an OpenAI would—maybe there is one deal so big that it would literally return the vintage such that if you just bought the entire vintage you’re good—that probably happens maybe once every decade or two.” Synthesia, the AI video generation company at $150M ARR, reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Adobe. They’re now raising north of $3 billion instead. The Case for Selling: Lemkin was direct: “I would tell him to take it unless you’re 100% sure you’re going to build a $20 billion public company, $10 billion public company. And if you are, do it. I like to stress the test. So I’m not saying that’s the right thing to do, but I want to be the guy that gives that advice.” He continued: “Even 10 is not really worth it for a founder. It is worth it for the VCs. Excel gets another play. 3 to 10 for Excel—huge difference. So let’s say they own 15% out of a—what—$450 million fund. Instead of a 1x fund returner, it could be a two or 3x. You make that bet as a VC all day long. For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference.” On the reality of wealth: “We’ve had billionaires on our show. You’ve had billionaires, Harry. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money. It’s the same dude.” The Underrated Question: Lemkin raised the question no one asks: “There’s another thing that’s under-discussed and I’ve had this conversation twice with founders in the last 12 to 18 months in similar situations: Are you really an IPO guy? I love everything about this company, I love the founders, I love everything. There’s nothing negative. And I told them to take the offer even though I didn’t want them to as an investor. I told them to take the offer because I said, ‘You’re such a great set of founders, but I don’t know if today I see you living the public company CEO life. I just don’t see it—the way you have to do it, the constraints, the stress.'” He explained the stakes: “You have to assume it’s IPO or bust. And if you’re not that guy, then you’re going to bring in an outside CEO or it’s just a mess. So that’s the question I have: Do you really want to run a public company for real?” On the weight of being public: “I was at this Dreamforce Benioff dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know that have all been on Harry’s show and Rory’s invested in some of them. And it was great and it was fun. I got some hugs. But man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight—they weren’t stressed, no one was stressed—the weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” The Case for Taking the Risk: O’Driscoll provided the growth analysis: “Victor, I admire Synthesia enormously as a company. We tried to contact them—they didn’t get back to me. They got the deal done. I’m so disappointed. We have another investment in the space. I love the space. I admire Synthesia a ton and many of the investors there. I think the first question is how do you feel about the business? And you threw out a statistic there—they said they’re at 100 million in ARR when they took the Adobe money in April. I checked. And if they really have gone from 100 to 150 in less than 6 months, then I can make this conversation really quick. There’s no way they should sell because that thing’s exploding.” He added the category perspective: “It’s a great category. There’s a reason we made another investment in the space. We like the category. I think there’s runway there for that kind of human interface to compute.” On the LP pressure question, Lemkin pushed back: “I don’t believe that. I don’t see it. I’ve asked my LPs, I’ve asked a few others. If you’re a strong manager—okay, if you have a track record and their goal is not a 3x seed fund, but if they really want 5x or north out of you—they get the game is you got to keep playing another card. No matter what they say, I’ve asked my LP and I guess it’s a small set—do you want more money back? Even ask my most conservative LP like a university endowment that is small, that has stress—I ask you want your money back, I mean with a gain—they’re like no, we’re just telling you we’re really worried about it, like we really want DPI but we don’t want it. We want you to play another card.” O’Driscoll summarized the board conversation: “I always tell the CEO, ‘Now would be a really good time for you to look into your own heart and see how you feel. And if there’s something about the business that’s really worrying you and you haven’t told us, now would be a good time to share.’ And sometimes stuff comes out.” Stebbings added the regulatory timeline dimension: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ By which time I’ll be $400 million in revenue being acquired for $3 billion. You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times.” Amazon announced their largest white-collar layoffs ever (10% of corporate staff), is losing cloud market share (from 50% in 2018 to 38% today), and had a major AWS outage causing billions in damage. The Timing Question: O’Driscoll noted: “Contrast this with Sergey Brin coming back to Google, everything else happening. Maybe this was a tough time for your founder to leave and go to Miami. Maybe this was not—maybe it seemed like a very stable time to do a transition. Long time as CEO, but maybe this wasn’t the perfect age of maybe stepping down just before AI hit was suboptimal for Amazon.” Lemkin provided historical context: “Jeff Bezos checked out right at the peak of the last era when products were frozen in time for a decade, when AWS was the same product for a year. So are most of the companies we invested in all three of us in 2021—they were the same products as 2015. It was the great time to go to Miami because nothing was changing in the product. It was just going—just stock prices were going up in revenue, but the products were the same. So why wouldn’t you retire? There’s not going to be any change.” The Counterargument: O’Driscoll offered the alternative view: “Or maybe it was brilliant for Jeff because maybe the hook—because you’re implying in that that had he stayed all these bad things wouldn’t have happened. And it’s plausible just given his world top two or three entrepreneurial achievement of the last three decades.” But then he turned cynical: “When you’ve got a couple hundred billion dollars, my guess is you’re not maximizing money. You’re maximizing psychic pain and joy. My guess is his psychic joy in the last three or four years doing what he’s been doing has been significantly higher than the psychic pain that would have been involved in realizing you’ve never done a big acquisition in your life, you got to do a huge corporate deal in AI to matter, and all those people you hired in ’21 trying to do the right thing for COVID and expand—you all got to lay them off.” Lemkin was even blunter: “I think Bezos would lay off half his company in a fortnight if it was the right thing. I don’t think you even care.” The Problem Analysis: O’Driscoll broke down Amazon’s challenges: “The first problem is in their retail business they overinvested for COVID and now they’re trying to replace people with robotics because the technology is there and that’s just something that had to be done. And in cloud it’s less that their core AWS business has folded up. It’s like all the new compute which is 10x and 20x larger in terms of demand for these customers is AI-related compute and you’ve neither built something compelling standalone nor have you partnered—except to be fair a little bit with Anthropic. You didn’t make a meaningful partnership and you haven’t found a way to get some of that compute.” On the hyperscaler comparison: “Of the three hyperscalers in the pre-AI world, Google was able to be relevant because they had their own model. Microsoft went and rented a model from OpenAI and now the contract’s nearly up and they did it to make a lot of capital gain but they didn’t actually in my view really develop something compelling that they own from it. And you did nothing—so you lose.” Lemkin added perspective: “One thing we shouldn’t do here and you saw a lot of it with Google too is that you don’t want to overcompensate. There’s a bunch of bad news in one day and it is bad. But your position in retail is broadly good. You’re a little schlocking in terms of shopping experience but you have dominance because of your distribution and you’re doubling down on that. You’re reinvesting in robotics, you’re cutting costs. Amazon wins in their retail business because they can deliver shit faster than anyone else on the planet pretty much anywhere and you’re doubling down on that. So that’s like a win on the compute business on the AWS business. Your problem is you just—you’re not relevant in the new world. So just knuckle down and figure that out.” iRobot (Roomba) had a $1.7 billion acquisition offer from Amazon blocked by the EU “because of an incipient monopoly in the house vacuum cleaner marketplace,” as Benedict Evans sarcastically noted. The company raised $200 million in debt to bridge the deal. Now that debt is spent and they’re likely going bankrupt. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “It’s a horrible and unfair outcome for which the government and Lina Khan and the FTC is entirely responsible based on an outdated, stupid, and foolish belief about how things work beyond doubt.” The M&A Lesson: Lemkin explained the broader implication: “It’s also a reminder that when you’re going to the M&A offer like Synthesia, sometimes you’ll get the acquirer will pay a multiple that only sort of kind of makes sense—a revenue multiple that makes sense for them but you couldn’t get. And so when you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” Stebbings added the timeline problem: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ This prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions.” O’Driscoll provided the math: “Everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, you got a 2.5x in 6 months.’ No, you didn’t. You got a 2.5x in 2 years. And this prolongs—this antitrust—this prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions and at the margin probably pushes people to either push on or in the case of the crazy deals when the acquirer only wants the people, then they do the Silicon Valley acqui-hire routine. But when you’re buying the vacuum cleaner company, you want the freaking vacuums.” The conversation turned to a technical but critical question: Should investors optimize for IRR or multiple? Stebbings made the case for duration: “That duration period is also why I think it’s our responsibility as early-stage managers to be much more proactive in secondary markets because we get cash back way sooner. And the age-old thing of a 4x fund over 17 years is the same as a 2.5x fund over 10—and duration matters and time matters and IRR is king.” O’Driscoll provided the mathematical answer: “It’s not the only king because—I mean back to Jason’s comment—look, in this very show Jason was going, ‘Oh, it’s only a 30% IRR Ramp from the 22 billion to 30 billion.’ From an IRR perspective that looks amazing. So I don’t think IRR matters. I actually think the correct formulation of the optimization function is the maximization of multiple subject to a constraint on a minimum IRR.” He explained: “Basically you should know what your target IRR is—and let’s just say it’s 25%—you want to maximize the multiple provided you don’t dip below 25%. That’s actually what you’re trying to do. So a 30% IRR in one year isn’t as good as a 25% IRR for four years. But if you hold on too long and that 25 starts dipping to 19, 18, 17, then you’ve gone to a different place.” The reasoning: “In the end you want the maximum amount of capital to invest and you get that because you are held accountable at the investor level at the IRR basis because at some point they’re looking at you, they’re looking at the public markets and they’re saying risk-adjusted I need my 20%. So it is the constraint because it’s what prevents money from coming down the spigot to you but you’re actually trying to maximize your multiple.” The mega-funds are real and here to stay. But as Lemkin pointed out, when you break down their individual fund sizes, “I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has… So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” O’Driscoll agreed but added the caveat: “The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Revenue multiples are compressing for mature companies. As Lemkin noted, “Going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough… You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share.” Understanding your per-share price, not just company valuation, is critical. Stebbings emphasized: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue.” When a strategic acquirer offers a premium multiple, think hard about whether you’re really an IPO CEO. Lemkin’s advice: “Are you really an IPO guy? Can you really run a—do you really want to run a public company for real? The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today.” But understand the VC incentive misalignment: “For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference. We’ve had billionaires on our show. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money.” Factor in 18-24 months for regulatory review on any significant acquisition. O’Driscoll: “You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times, and it’s just not going to feel that much.” And as iRobot shows, Lemkin noted: “When you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” The Carter data confirms what great investors always knew: picking matters. O’Driscoll: “Two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off.” Companies like Mercor with massive customer concentration can grow incredibly fast, but as O’Driscoll warned: “At some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million.’ You prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two.” OpenAI IPO Watch: O’Driscoll: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Mega-Funds Everywhere: The venture industry is bifurcating. O’Driscoll: “This is the dominant modality today. These are—this is what top dog venture investing looks like. This kind of scale, this kind of dollars at work and there’s four or five other firms doing this.” AI Capex Super-Cycle: Everything from Mercor to OpenAI to AWS vs Azure is a bet on continued AI infrastructure spending. O’Driscoll: “This whole thing top to bottom is one big-ass bet on AI capex hyperrowth and as long as it keeps happening… you got to stay on the floor and keep dancing.” As Chuck Prince famously said in 2007: “As long as the music is playing, you got to get up and dance.” Private Staying Private: Companies like Stripe, Brex, and Ramp are staying private far longer than historical norms. O’Driscoll explained why: “There’s really early and late-stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public.” The venture game is evolving faster than ever. The winners will be those who understand not just what’s changing, but why it’s changing—and what that means for where the puck is going, not where it’s been. Jason Lemkin on Sam Altman Having Zero Equity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion-dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll on Microsoft’s Win: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” Harry Stebbings on LP Bundling: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” Rory O’Driscoll on The Spray and Pray Myth: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” Jason Lemkin on Public Company CEO Stress: “I was at this Dreamforce dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know… and man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” Harry Stebbings on A16z’s Structural Advantages: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not convinced. "This is different," Powell told reporters on Wednesday when asked about applying any lessons from the 1990s dot-com crash to today's AI boom. "If you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [era], these were ideas rather than companies," he added. "So, there's a clear bubble there. Whereas—I won't go into particular [tech company] names—but [today's top performers] actually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits. So it's really a different thing." In other words, Powell believes businesses like Amazon, which reported $18 billion in profit last quarter, have ongoing revenue streams to keep the companies afloat, even if their AI ambitions don't pan out. An economic bubble is the "rapid escalation in asset prices, often due to speculative behavior, followed by a sharp contraction," according to Investopedia. They're hard to identify in real-time, but lead to "significant economic consequences" once they burst. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is one of the most notable examples, along with the Japanese economic contraction in the 1980s, and the Dutch "Tulip Mania" of the 1630s. Today, it's not speculative tulip investments that would bring down the economy, but data centers. The sums of money tech companies are pouring into them are astronomical, suggesting a high level of confidence that has sent stocks soaring. Nvidia just hit the $5 trillion valuation mark. Earlier this year, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank pledged to invest $500 billion in AI data centers over the next four years via their Stargate project. Yesterday, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, while Google, Microsoft, Meta, and others have similar plans. Data centers require a small number of employees, but building them generates temporary business for suppliers and construction companies. "The investment we're getting into equipment and all the things that go into creating data centers and feeding AI, it's clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy," Powell said this week. He admitted he couldn't say if the data center investments "will work out," but does not think they will affect interest rates either way, which is his primary concern. (On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point.) Still, the AI hype is not translating into a hiring boom. Amazon just laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the need to move fast in AI (and pay for the GPUs needed to power it), which might climb to 30,000 in 2026. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI and poached its founder to lead AI at Meta, but recently laid off 600 employees as part of a team restructuring. When asked about whether AI is contributing to layoffs, Powell said it's too soon to tell, but it's an area the Federal Reserve is concerned about and watching closely. "You see a significant amount of companies announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or are actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they are talking about AI and what it can do," he said. "It could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't see it in the initial [jobless] claims data yet, but it takes some time to get in there. We are watching that very carefully, but don't see it yet." The government shutdown is further hampering efforts to secure the federal employment data report for September. In its absence, Powell referenced "anecdotal data" from earnings reports, where companies are discussing a "bifurcated economy," meaning very different activity among high-income consumers who are still spending a lot, and lower-income consumers who are tightening their belts. "We think there's something there," Powell said. Other data points the Fed is using as a proxy for the official, federal report—such as unemployment insurance claims and job listings on Indeed—show that the situation has been "stable" over the last few weeks, Powell said. Regarding tariffs, which have hit tech companies like Apple, Powell seemed cautiously optimistic. "Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation," he said. "A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived, a one-time shift in the price level. "But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent," he cautioned. "And that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem."

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Are we in an AI bubble? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not convinced. "This is different," Powell told reporters on Wednesday when asked about applying any lessons from the 1990s dot-com crash to today's AI boom. "If you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [era], these were ideas rather than companies," he added. "So, there's a clear bubble there. Whereas—I won't go into particular [tech company] names—but [today's top performers] actually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits. So it's really a different thing." In other words, Powell believes businesses like Amazon, which reported $18 billion in profit last quarter, have ongoing revenue streams to keep the companies afloat, even if their AI ambitions don't pan out. An economic bubble is the "rapid escalation in asset prices, often due to speculative behavior, followed by a sharp contraction," according to Investopedia. They're hard to identify in real-time, but lead to "significant economic consequences" once they burst. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is one of the most notable examples, along with the Japanese economic contraction in the 1980s, and the Dutch "Tulip Mania" of the 1630s. Today, it's not speculative tulip investments that would bring down the economy, but data centers. The sums of money tech companies are pouring into them are astronomical, suggesting a high level of confidence that has sent stocks soaring. Nvidia just hit the $5 trillion valuation mark. Earlier this year, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank pledged to invest $500 billion in AI data centers over the next four years via their Stargate project. Yesterday, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, while Google, Microsoft, Meta, and others have similar plans. Data centers require a small number of employees, but building them generates temporary business for suppliers and construction companies. "The investment we're getting into equipment and all the things that go into creating data centers and feeding AI, it's clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy," Powell said this week. He admitted he couldn't say if the data center investments "will work out," but does not think they will affect interest rates either way, which is his primary concern. (On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point.) Still, the AI hype is not translating into a hiring boom. Amazon just laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the need to move fast in AI (and pay for the GPUs needed to power it), which might climb to 30,000 in 2026. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI and poached its founder to lead AI at Meta, but recently laid off 600 employees as part of a team restructuring. When asked about whether AI is contributing to layoffs, Powell said it's too soon to tell, but it's an area the Federal Reserve is concerned about and watching closely. "You see a significant amount of companies announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or are actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they are talking about AI and what it can do," he said. "It could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't see it in the initial [jobless] claims data yet, but it takes some time to get in there. We are watching that very carefully, but don't see it yet." The government shutdown is further hampering efforts to secure the federal employment data report for September. In its absence, Powell referenced "anecdotal data" from earnings reports, where companies are discussing a "bifurcated economy," meaning very different activity among high-income consumers who are still spending a lot, and lower-income consumers who are tightening their belts. "We think there's something there," Powell said. Other data points the Fed is using as a proxy for the official, federal report—such as unemployment insurance claims and job listings on Indeed—show that the situation has been "stable" over the last few weeks, Powell said. Regarding tariffs, which have hit tech companies like Apple, Powell seemed cautiously optimistic. "Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation," he said. "A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived, a one-time shift in the price level. "But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent," he cautioned. "And that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem."

Former New World devs could find work at Riot Games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Fantasy MMO New World got the death knell from Amazon this week, as the company announced season 10 would round out updates to the game amid wider layoffs affecting some 14,000 jobs. Players and devs alike are commiserating, and now a co-founder of Riot Games has put out a call for the talent who are seeking their next gig. In the immediate wake of New World being sunsetted, someone tweeted at Marc Merrill, who co-created League of Legends and now serves as co-chair and CPO at Riot, stating that he needs to pick up some of the developers who've been set adrift. "Who are the star devs on the teams?" he says. "We're always on the lookout for S-tier talent who want to take on some of the hardest challenges and solve problems on behalf of the most dedicated players." The person who contacted Merrill states that a "Riot MMO" is a "massive need," likely referring to the online RPG the company announced in 2020. Where that project is remians up in the air, but the staff of New World probably wouldn’t be a bad fit for LoL, the still-upcoming Project F, and whatever else Riot is working on. They have experience handling a massive game through peaks and valleys, responding to the needs and wants of a global fanbase for four years. Who are the star devs on the teams?

In fact, the most recent expansion, Nighthaven, helped revive New World and put it on a more positive trajectory, making the recent turn of events even more heartbreaking, especially for players who’d stuck with Aeternum through thick and thin.

Title: Update on Next Tomb Raider Game Is Surprising Amid Recent News

Time Published: 2025-10-30T17:04:00Z
Full Content:
By Jonathan H. Kantor A new Tomb Raider game that’s in development received a surprising update in October 2025. Since the first Tomb Raider game arrived on the Sega Saturn in 1996, the franchise has been one of the most enduring of the past few decades. There have been multiple titles, many of which have received widespread critical acclaim, and there’s also a feature film franchise and a forthcoming Amazon Prime series starring Sophie Turner. The last mainline Tomb Raider game was Square Enix Europe’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018. Since then, a mobile game, two remasters, and a collection have become available, but no new AAA titles have been released. The next game entered development in 2022, and it just received an interesting update. In late October 2025, Amazon announced a mass layoff of 14,000 employees, which had a significant impact on Amazon Game Studios. However, according to Variety, this didn’t derail the development of the next Tomb Raider title. The as-yet untitled game was first announced by Variety in 2022, and while it seemed the game would be on the chopping block, it appears it’s been spared. The same cannot be said of Amazon Games’ previously forthcoming Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which was cancelled. Still, fans of Lara Croft and her adventure game series can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing development continues, though a release date remains elusive as of writing. The next game in the Tomb Raider franchise is being developed by Crystal Dynamics, with Amazon Games set to publish. The game will ultimately be released as a multi-platform title, although details of the story, gameplay, and other elements remain closely guarded secrets. It’s been in development for over three years, so hopefully, it’s nearing completion, but its release window is anyone’s guess. The game is said to continue Lara Croft’s story, set in an environment that rewards players for solving puzzles, creative pathfinding, and overcoming deadly enemies. Crystal Dynamics is developing the game using Unreal Engine 5. From perilous expeditions to adrenaline-filled Trials, Lara Croft is ready for every situation.The @tombraider Collection returns with two new looks: the Iconic Lara Outfit and the Shadow Runner Outfit. Now available (cont) https://t.co/wO5hNvRrr6 pic.twitter.com/wAHQugSlIQ Like other Tomb Raider games, fans can expect a strong, story-driven single-player narrative. Crystal Dynamics previously claimed its game would be transformative, and the developer is excited to team up with Amazon Studios. Following the announcement of mass layoffs at the publisher, which was launched in 2012, it seemed likely that every game currently in development would be terminated. While the layoffs did hit several titles, Tomb Raider and March of Giants, which recently completed its closed alpha, were spared. According to Bloomberg, Amazon Games is restructuring to support its cloud gaming service Luna with a focus on “casual and AI-focused games.” News of Tomb Raider’s survival brings hope to players who’ve longed to return to the familiar and beloved IP since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That game was successful, and while Crystal Dynamics, then a subsidiary of Square Enix Europe, offered support, it wasn’t a primary developer. The game featured a continued story in Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix. Now that the IP has returned to Crystal Dynamics (Now part of Sweden’s Embracer Group), there’s a lot of talent coming from a studio with a longstanding history with the franchise.

Many changes have taken place within Amazon, and some people fear that the development of the next Tomb Raider game will be affected by them. But fortunately, this does not seem to be the case. Thus, these layoffs have particularly affected Amazon's gaming division, with budget cuts for several studios. And this has caused considerable concern among players, who fear that projects currently under development will be canceled. But Steve Boom announced some good news in a note relayed by Game Rant. Amazon is still working on an open-world driving simulator and on March of Giants, which is the first game from Amazon Games Montreal. In addition, the collaboration with Crystal Dynamics continues, reassuring many fans. However, no further information has been revealed about its gameplay or its story, even though many rumors have emerged in recent months. Indeed, while we know that this will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used, some people believe that it will be an open world, offering many possibilities. But it will be necessary to wait for new information from Crystal Dynamics to confirm these rumors. Not to mention that the decisions made by Amazon in the coming months could change the projects around this game. Game Rant

Title: Jerome Powell says the AI hiring apocalypse is real: ‘Job creation is pretty close to zero’

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell drew a stark picture of a labor market that looks fine on the surface—4.3% unemployment, solid consumer spending—but is quietly losing momentum underneath. Once you adjust for statistical overcounting in the payroll data, he said during a press conference Wednesday following the FOMC meeting, “job creation is pretty close to zero.”He connected that slowdown, at least in part, to what CEOs are now openly telling investors: AI allows them to do more with fewer people. He noted “a significant number of companies” have recently announced layoffs or hiring pauses, with many of them explicitly citing AI as the reason. “Much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s rate-cut decision, warning large employers are signaling they won’t need to add headcount for years. “We’re watching that very carefully,” he added. The comments come as the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75%–4%, citing “downside risks to employment” even as inflation remains elevated. Powell said the U.S. economy is still expanding at a “moderate pace,” even as hiring slows. He described that spending as one of the “big sources of growth in the economy,” driven by companies building data centers and other equipment tied to artificial intelligence. Powell also pushed back on the idea that all that spending is amounting to another speculative bubble. He drew a clear line between today’s surge in capital expenditure and the dot-com era, noting “these companies actually have earnings.” Those projects, he said, aren’t especially sensitive to interest rates, though, since they reflect long-term bets on higher productivity. At the same time, Powell emphasized the boom creates a policy dilemma for the Fed. AI and automation are boosting output, but they’re also allowing companies to do more with fewer workers, leaving the labor market softer, even while GDP stays positive.“We have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment,” he said. “This is a very difficult thing for a central bank, because one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher.” Recent corporate announcements illustrate Powell’s warning. Amazon announced this week it laid off 14,000 middle managers—about 4% of its white-collar workforcein an effort to “remove organizational layers.” The layoffs come amid their rampant investments into AI. Target, Paramount, and other large firms followed with their own cuts. According to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report, U.S. employers have announced nearly 946,000 layoffs so far this year—the highest total since 2020—with more than 17,000 explicitly tied to AI and another 20,000 to automation.“Job creation is very low, and the job-finding rate for people who are unemployed is very low,” Powell said.The phenomenon is so widespread some economists have coined a new term—the “Great Freeze”—to describe the dismal labor market conditions. With unemployment among recent college grads topping 5%—and AI threatening to automate entry-level office jobs—many Gen Z workers are turning to graduate school as a strategic timeout. That awkward balance—strong investment but weak hiring— is now at the center of the Fed’s decision-making. Powell said the economy increasingly resembles a K-shape, with higher-income households and large corporations benefiting from strong stock markets and AI-fueled productivity gains, while lower-income consumers pull back under the weight of rising costs. He pointed to anecdotal reports from major retailers and consumer companies describing a “bifurcated economy,” in which wealthier Americans continue to spend freely but those at the bottom are trading down to cheaper goods. ““Consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said, noting the uneven effects of growth make the Fed’s balancing act even more complicated. “There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell said. “We’re navigating the tension between our employment and inflation goals as carefully as we can.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: AI Layoffs: Why Understanding Intent May Save Your Job
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/10/30/ai-layoffs-why-understanding-intent-may-save-your-job/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:14:08Z

ByJason Snyder, Contributor. The AI layoffs I first wrote about back in February have arrived. Since Meta’s cuts last week, major disruptions have begun across the AI sector, and beyond. Amazon plans to cut about 14,000 corporate roles globally, and as many as 30,000 over time (roughly 10% of its corporate workforce), as part of a restructuring tied to artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Google and other firms are also reorganizing – citing efficiency, focus and alignment with AI strategy. This isn’t just a tech correction. It’s a structural reset. As AI shifts from novelty to infrastructure, the human roles that once defined creativity, strategy and judgment are being automated or absorbed into systems that optimize for speed over understanding. And yet, there’s still one thing machines can’t own: intent, the upstream human signal that gives action purpose. Understanding and articulating intent may soon be the difference between those who shape AI and those replaced by it. The dominant AI players: Meta, Google, OpenAI, Amazon are no longer competing merely on intelligence. They’re competing on possession. Each is building an integrated loop that spans: Distribution once meant where ads were placed. Now it’s where experience is orchestrated. These models don’t just distribute information, they author it. They can create therapy sessions, games, music, fiction, or conversation tailored to a single person. They don’t just engage your mind; they train your emotions. And as they enter the physical world, embodied in robots, vehicles, wearables, and domestic devices, engagement will soon be sensorial, kinetic, and intimate. The system that writes, distributes, and monetizes the experience will also measure how your pulse, posture, or tone responds to it. That’s not an advertising ecosystem. It’s an ecosystem of human behavior. On paper, the job reductions are framed as efficiency moves, reallocating human capital to fund automation and infrastructure. Yet there’s a second-order effect worth noting: historically, waves of mass layoffs often precede efforts that show higher operating margins and signal “discipline” to investors. Meta’s 2025 cost-cutting, alongside its AI push, coincided with a strong share-price run this year. Whether that’s coincidence or choreography, it points to a deeper truth, AI isn’t just reshaping labor; it’s reshaping perception. The narrative of efficiency has become as valuable as efficiency itself. If you can show Wall Street that you’re automating the future, you don’t have to prove it’s working yet. This isn’t just a tech correction, it’s a structural shift. As AI systems evolve from novelty to infrastructure, companies are resetting human-capital priorities, reallocating talent, and signalling that automation plus consolidation is becoming the new baseline. And the significance of this magnitude reaches far beyond engineers and labs, it touches the upstream layers of agency, narrative, design, and human intention. If the roles that once defined value are shrinking, then the only remaining locus of value becomes the channel that can’t be fully automated: the intent behind the action. When the model, the medium, and the market collapse into one stack, autonomy becomes scarce. If the same company owns the intelligence, the infrastructure, and the interface, then creativity, communication, and even emotion occur inside its design space. You may feel free, but you’re acting within pre-optimized constraints. The question isn’t “Can AI replace humans?” It’s subtler: Who decides what we experience, and why? Every major platform is quietly merging its business model with its model of you. As AI systems generate news, entertainment, education, therapy, and commerce, they’re also shaping the frameworks that determine what you see, when you see it, and how you feel about it. The feed has become the factory. When model owners bolt shopping carts onto chatbots and pair inference with advertising, they don’t just mediate attention; they monetize intention. The same engine that recommends your next purchase is learning what persuades you, predicts your emotional triggers, and trains itself to keep you inside the loop. That’s the trap. The user becomes the product, the participant, and the proof of concept. Algorithms already taught us to insulate, to hate, to consume the illusion of choice. Generative AI takes that one step further, it can now manufacture the choice itself. What begins as personalization ends as programming. The danger isn’t that AI will replace your job; it’s that it will replace the space in which decisions, creativity, and dissent once lived. When meaning, money, and motivation all flow through the same systems, we stop being users and start being used. That’s where intent becomes the new field of power, and the last one not yet owned. Intent is the upstream signal, the human why that precedes the algorithmic what. It’s the one variable platforms can’t fully predict or possess. As my friend Mark Masterson, founder of the Bureau of Bad Decisions, put it to me recently as he was preparing for a talk to the Singapore AI Association: It’s a perfect description of the moment we’re in. AI isn’t killing art, design, or innovation, it’s revealing the hollow parts of them. It’s showing us where process replaced purpose, where scale drowned sincerity. When everything can be generated, the only thing that still matters is whether we meant it. Masterson is right. When every platform measures success through engagement, intent is the only metric that can tell us whether that engagement is authentic or automatic. Intent isn’t something brands can own; it’s something they can learn to recognize and measure. It becomes the independent variable of efficacy, a way to assess outcomes outside the black box of model-defined metrics. If a platform tells you a model “works,” it’s grading its own homework. Intent lets you ask a different question: Did this align with human purpose, or merely optimize for platform goals? Intent reframes success as alignment, not amplification. It’s how we separate meaning from manipulation in an environment where the algorithms increasingly speak for us. If intent is the signal, consent is the boundary, the line that defines whether interaction is mutual or extractive. In a world where AI doesn’t just read your words but your tone, gestures, and micro-expressions, consent must evolve from legal checkbox to continuous state. It must become dynamic, not static, an ongoing negotiation of access, data, and emotional bandwidth. Apple’s privacy architecture hints at this shift: it turns consent into a user-level design principle rather than a buried agreement. Likewise, the EU’s emerging AI Act and the proposed “right to explanation” are early attempts to legislate that same principle, the right to know why a model acts on your behalf. Spotify also publishes explanations of how recommendations are generated, another small move toward algorithmic transparency. Consent ensures that participation remains voluntary even as systems grow more persuasive. It re-anchors human agency in a world optimized to remove hesitation. In the frictionless economy, sameness is the side effect. Everything that’s easy begins to look the same because it’s produced by identical optimization logic. Friction, the resistance that slows execution, is what verifies intent. It’s the pause that reveals whether a purpose can withstand pressure. For brands, friction might mean transparency, restraint, or a moment of human intervention that interrupts automation. Those aren’t inefficiencies; they’re signs of integrity. When we remove friction, we don’t just accelerate; we flatten. Some leaders are already redefining what autonomy can look like in an age of consolidation. Brad Jackson, founder and CEO of Out Of Office, is one of them. His platform virtualizes production talent, turning experiential-marketing skills into modular, portable assets rather than static employment roles. Sharing his perspective with me, Jackson said: His model signals a transition: from employment as a fixed position inside a platform-owned stack to employment as a portable expression of human intent. It’s a blueprint for reclaiming control under consolidation. This isn’t poetry, it’s an operating model for the next economy. When platforms own the pipelines of content, commerce, and cognition, the only independent measure of value left is meaning, and meaning requires friction. Leaders who understand this can reclaim autonomy by managing what machines can’t: the why behind every what. 1. Measure intent, not just engagement. Engagement tells you what happened; intent tells you why. Track upstream indicators, search phrasing, timing, tone, motivation, to gauge whether behavior aligns with purpose. When a platform hands you engagement metrics, ask for intent metrics instead. 2. Design for productive friction. Frictionless systems scale fast but flatten everything they touch. The right amount of resistance creates reflection, a moment when a user chooses instead of drifting. In commerce, that might mean a confirmation step that clarifies consent; in storytelling, a pause that deepens connection. Friction turns participation into intention. 3. Treat consent as a continuous dialogue. Consent isn’t a checkbox; it’s a conversation. Every data exchange, recommendation, or model-driven touchpoint should make choice visible. Apple’s privacy prompts and Spotify’s algorithmic transparency are small but powerful examples of consent-by-design. 4. Build your own validation layer. Don’t let the platform grade its own homework. Create independent measures of success, qualitative feedback, narrative alignment, employee sentiment, that test whether technology is amplifying your intent or replacing it. Friction isn’t failure; it’s a diagnostic for authenticity. 5. Reinvest in the human interface. As AI takes over execution, value shifts to presence: empathy, creativity, and judgment. Brands that invest in conversation, care, and curiosity will stand out amid perfect automation. When every system is engineered to erase hesitation, the leaders who can pause, reflect, and act with intent will define the next era of intelligence. AI’s consolidation signals the end of technical differentiation but the beginning of philosophical differentiation. The next competitive frontier won’t be who trains the biggest model; it will be who defines the clearest why. Brands, creators, and institutions that thrive will measure not just engagement but alignment, the resonance between human intent and machine output. They’ll design consent architectures that make participation explicit. And they’ll use friction strategically, as the necessary resistance that proves authenticity. In the coming years, as generative systems evolve from companions to collaborators to co-inhabitants, teaching, healing, building, touching, the challenge won’t be how fast AI can think. It will be how faithfully it reflects what humans mean. Because when the models own the engines, the platforms, and the distribution, and soon the gestures, the voices, and the gaze, the only remaining space for human agency is before the prompt. That’s the moment of intent. And that’s where meaning, freedom, and identity still belong to us, Some thinkers are already working to rebuild the relationship between people and the systems that shape their lives. Joe Woof, co-lead of the Addiction Economy project and founder of Society Inside, is one of them. His work focuses on redesigning technology and policy frameworks so that social systems and data systems evolve together, accountable to human purpose rather than platform growth. As Woof told me, the problem runs deeper than technology: Woof’s warning reframes the stakes: this isn’t just about ethics, it’s about public health, trust, and long-term business survival. Protecting human intent isn’t simply the right thing to do; it’s the durable thing to do. Systems that honor agency and consent outperform over time because people trust them. They attract loyalty, repeat use, and genuine advocacy, the very qualities algorithms still can’t manufacture. When people feel seen rather than scanned, they stay. In capital markets, authenticity scales faster than optimization because it compounds: customers return, employees engage, and regulators back off. The same principle applies to any business that relies on data or creativity, when individuals understand how and why their participation matters, they participate more fully. Woof’s vision mirrors the argument running through this piece: intent shouldn’t just guide individuals, it should be embedded in institutions. As AI centralizes intelligence and distribution, Society Inside reminds us that true innovation is not only technical but relational, building ecosystems where choice, consent, and shared intent become competitive advantages. The workers most at risk in this wave aren’t simply those with outdated skills, they’re the ones whose work has been stripped of visible intent. AI can replicate tasks, but it can’t replicate why you do them. For many people, that “why” has been buried under bureaucracy or burnout, not lost through laziness. Understanding intent isn’t about individual heroism; it’s about rediscovering the purpose that technology can’t code. When your daily output connects to judgment, empathy, synthesis, or creative intuition, qualities no model can truly imitate, you become harder to replace. Seeing your own intent clarifies where you add meaning. It turns you from an executor into an architect, someone shaping outcomes, not just performing them. We can’t control the speed of automation or the AI layoffs that follow, but we can control how clearly we act with intent. Those who do will shape the next chapter instead of being written out of it.

Title: YouTube Embraces AI, Offers Voluntary Buyouts to U.S. Employees

Google’s YouTube is restructuring its products team in a major shift towards AI, offering voluntary buyout packages with severance to its U.S.-based employees. CNBC reports that YouTube, Google’s online video platform that has been a staple of the internet since its launch in 2005, is undergoing a significant staffing shakeup as the company pivots to focus on AI. According to an internal memo from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, the company is restructuring its products team for the first time in a decade, a move that comes as parent company Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai has urged staff to embrace AI for increased productivity. As part of the restructuring process, YouTube is offering its U.S.-based employees voluntary buyout packages that include severance pay. This decision follows a growing trend among tech giants, such as Amazon, which recently announced layoffs of 14,000 employees as the company also embraces AI. A YouTube spokesperson stated, “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI,” claiming that no roles are being eliminated with the restructure, despite buyouts being offered to staff. Instead, the company aims to reorganize its teams to better align with its AI-driven future. The move towards AI is not unique to YouTube and Amazon. Many tech companies are recognizing the transformative potential of this technology, with some even calling it the most significant advancement since the advent of the internet. However, this shift has also raised concerns about the impact on the workforce, as evidenced by the layoffs and restructuring at various tech giants. In a memo shared publicly, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Read more at CNBC here.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer one of Wall Street's biggest questions: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? First scenario: The company announced 14,000 layoffs earlier this week because it's worried about its performance and wants to cut costs. Second scenario: The tech giant has become so great at artificial intelligence that its operations are becoming way more efficient, and it doesn't need as many employees now. The results, and a conference call with analysts, should shed light on this. Of course, the reality could be a combination of these two scenarios or something entirely different. When Amazon reports, there's also one particular number to watch: revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud business. For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to reach $32.4 billion, representing an 18% year-over-year increase, according to RBC Capital. Microsoft reported on Wednesday that Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40%, and Google Cloud grew 34%. Google executives revealed on the company's Wednesday earnings call that Google Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined. These numbers are not always strictly comparable with AWS, but that's still very fast growth to compete with. If AWS growth exceeds expectations, that will likely be a relief for investors and could hint that scenario 2 is in play: AI transformation is taking hold, both for Amazon and its cloud customers. If AWS revenue misses that 18% growth number, then Wall Street will probably worry more, and the first scenario could kick in: Those job cuts could be a defensive move. Some analysts have been worried about AWS's lagging growth rate for at least a year. The company was a pioneer in the cloud, but AI is changing the market and giving rivals a new way to compete. Still, AWS remains the dominant player here, and it has promising opportunities, including a successful partnership with AI lab Anthropic. AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC on Wednesday that the company feels "quite good" about its massive AI investments. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here.

Title: New Lord of the Rings MMORPG Apparently Cancelled

Time Published: 2025-10-30T15:10:02Z
Full Content:
By Jonathan H. Kantor A Lord of the Rings MMORPG that’s been in development since early 2023 has apparently been cancelled. The expansive franchise based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s beloved novels has included several previous titles, many of which are highly regarded by the gaming community. The last time fans got to enjoy an MMORPG based on the novels came in 2007 with the release of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment’s The Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s considerably old compared to modern fare. Fans were eagerly anticipating a return to Middle-earth in an all-new, contemporary take on the franchise, but the game’s development ceased in October 2025. According to Bloomberg, Amazon began laying off 14,000 people in late October 2025, resulting in a significant reduction in personnel working at Amazon Games, which was publishing the MMORPG. While it wasn’t clear which divisions would take the brunt of the cuts, Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer at Amazon Games, revealed on LinkedIn that she was among the 14,000 cut, and the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was no longer in development. She included a note, adding, “Y’all would have loved it,” which seems likely given the amount of time, talent, and money that was previously attached. Amazon Games has been around since 2012, and it’s focused on publishing new content since its inception. That strategy appears to have shifted with the latest round of layoffs, which Amazon noted in a memo released on October 28, 2025, included “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games. The company is shifting its focus to its cloud gaming service Luna, which primarily serves as a TV-based platform for launching pre-existing titles. While The Lord of the Rings MMORPG is dead, Amazon Games will continue to develop and release March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider game, and “casual and AI-focused games.” In addition to the loss of employment for thousands of developers, the layoffs and subsequent cancelling of the MMORPG is a blow to gamers everywhere. Since Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring hit theaters in 2001, gamers have had access to a plethora of titles based on the franchise. There are plenty of older Lord of the Rings games that still hold up, but the loss of the forthcoming MMORPG is a significant blow to the community. While few details of the now-cancelled game were released, it would have been set in a persistent, open-world Middle-earth, drawing inspiration from the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings literary trilogies. Not only does the cancellation hurt longtime fans of the franchise, but it also represents a missed opportunity. Another Amazon product, its exceptionally expensive The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power streaming series, could have also been incorporated into the game. This would have significantly expanded the storyline to before the Third Age, when Sauron and his power are finally destroyed after the One Ring is thrown into the fires of Mount Doom. Even if players weren’t enamored with the series, its inclusion would have meant more expansive playtime, but now that it’s dead, it could be years before another studio attempts to develop a Lord of the Rings MMORPG.

Title: Did Amazon Just Kill Its Lord Of The Rings MMO?

Morning Checkpoint Is the Switch 2 doomed to be a physical graveyard of third-party game key cards? Why are so many new special edition controllers so ugly? And has Amazon really pulled the plug on its fledgling Lord of the Rings MMO? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint,Â Kotaku‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I don’t need any more gaming devices in my life but I’m obsessed with the latest batch of DS knock-offs out of China. Nintendo is really leaving money on the table by not shipping its own legacy handhelds. I mean, people were so desperate for a new Game Boy they hacked the Lego one so it could run games. Resident Evil Requiem gets a special Switch 2 Pro controller and amiibo www.vooks.net/reside… — Vooks (@vooks.net) 2025-10-29T22:58:16.000Z It’s the same dark shade as the normal Pro controller but with graphics from an in-game newspaper over the front. The words Resident Evil are also there but largely interrupted by the central Switch 2 logo. Truly a bummer. In other bad news, the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed to be a game key card. Rip. As spotted by Rock, Paper, Shotgun, developer Ashleigh Amrine made a now-deleted post on LinkedIn about the layoffs that hinted at the game no longer being in production. “This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers onÂ New WorldÂ and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),” sheÂ wrote. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about whether the project has been killed. It’s always possible the company is still still looking to offload the project or just license it out to another studio. If that game ever does come to market, however, it’ll probably bare no relation to whatever early prototype the New World devs were working on. Microsoft announced its second quarter earnings yesterday. While Azure cloud services and its AI gambles continue to pay off, the gaming division actually shrunk. Xbox gaming revenues were down $113 million with already terrible hardware numbers down 29 percent year over year. It’s worth noting that this was the same quarter when Microsoft jacked up the Xbox Series X/S consoles to $400 and $600 respectively due to Trump’s trade war. Somehow I don’t think a more expensive PC-like next-gen console with no exclusives will turn that around.

He said AI is currently incapable of making the GTA 6 marketing plan, let alone an entire game. And even if it could, he doesn’t think it would be any good. âAnything that involves backward-looking data compute, itâs really good for that and that applies to lots of things,â he told CNBC. âWhat we do at Take-Two, anything that isnât attached to that, itâs going to be really, really bad at.â Plus, he admits, it’s a legal minefield.

I could be projecting but the admission seemed tinge with sadness and a slight sense of betrayal. “At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldnât have accepted the offer right away,” the Death Stranding director concluded. “But if someone had told me, maybe there couldâve been a way to make it work.” fucking insanity man. pic.twitter.com/LITLrLyKzu — Seriously (@seriouslyjokinn) October 29, 2025 Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Big Employers Using AI to Decimate White Collar Jobs; What Happens When Real Incomes, Employment, and Social Compact Erode?

Seemmingly contradictory processes are at work. We may have reached peak AI, at least in terms of growth of use of the seemingly dominant type, large language models, which are conflated with “generative AI” (sticklers are encouraged to clear up fine points in comments). Several key growth measures are stalling out or even falling. Yet a wave of igh profile employers like Amazon, UPS, and Walmart announcing of big headcount cuts, citing AI implementation as the driver of the firings, says AI uptake is gaining steam. What gives? And more important, even if AI is not performing all that well in terms of accuracy and reliabilty, that may not matter much as long as it is (barely) good enough to corporate executives to screw down furhter on workers, here in comparatively well-paid white collar roles, to the benefit of their bonuses and shareholders. While an AI bubble crash (and accompanying reports of AI not living up to its promise) may put this trend on pause or even in reverse, if this trend continues at its current pace and intensity, it will further damage the career and income prospects of college educated workers, most of all recent graduates, so as to be counter-revolutionary. It will upend the heretofore tacitly accepted responsiblity of governments and the managerial classes to provide for an adequate level of employment and social safety nets in a system that requires most of the population to sell its labor as a condition of survival. It will also reverse the virtous circle created by Henry Ford1 of giving workers steady enough jobs at high enough pay levels that they could afford to buy the new products made possible by widespread electrification and the mass uptake of automobiles….including in due course suburban homes. And it will further erode class mobilty, aka The American Dream. The further thinning of the already increasingly precarious middle class will also greatly weaken social stability, particularly at a time when social safety nets are being gutted. Go long bodyguard services. While we don’t have definitive answers on what is happening in Corporate America, particularly given the diversity of the perps, at least one motivation is to take advantage of the AI mania, still very much alive in the markets, and goose the stock by wrapping what is largely good old fashioned work force squeezing/process re-engineering in the AI mantle (although CEOs are going to some lengths to depict AI implementations as pervasive). We may get a better grip on what is happening internally in the coming months. On the one hand, a well-publicized MIT study found that 95% of corporate pilots of AI did not pan out. On the other hand, there are more and more breathless stories of big employers and professional services firms reducing hiring, particularly of newbies, and even, slashing white collar staff levels. So is the way to square this circle that AI actually does not perform well, save as a weapon in class warfare? The Corporate AI Firing Frenzy Before unpacking the implications in more detail, let’s first look at the apparent magnitude of this trend. We’ve reported before that company leaders, in a sharp departure from historical practice, are touting running their companies with fewer warm bodies. This pursuit of corporate anexoria is long-standing (and extends to capex); we described it in 2005 in a Conference Review Board article, The Incredible Shrinking Corporation. The Wall Street Journal reported on this new enthusism in June and affirmed by Chief Executive Council: In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, it’s no longer rare to hear leaders celebrate layoffs as a badge of honor. CEOs are openly touting staff reductions; not as last-resort damage control, but as strategic wins. Companies are embracing workforce slimming as a deliberate tactic to prop up profitability and signal AI-readiness to investors. As reported by Wall Street Journal by Chip Cutter on June 27th, 2025. CEOs Are Shrinking Their Workforces—and They Couldn’t Be Prouder Big companies are getting smaller—and their CEOs want everyone to know it. The careful, coded corporate language executives once used in describing staff cuts is giving way to blunt boasts about ever-shrinking workforces. Gone are the days when trimming head count signaled retrenchment or trouble. Bosses are showing off to Wall Street that they are embracing artificial intelligence and serious about becoming lean. After all, it is no easy feat to cut head count for 20 consecutive quarters, an accomplishment Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer touted this month. The bank is using attrition “as our friend,” Charlie Scharf said on the bank’s quarterly earnings call as he told investors that its head count had fallen every quarter over the past five years—by a total of 23% over the period. Loomis, the Swedish cash-handling company, said it is managing to grow while reducing the number of employees, while Union Pacific, the rail operator, said its labor productivity had reached a record quarterly high as its staff size shrank by 3%. Last week, Verizon’s CEO told investors that the company had been “very, very good” on head count. Translation? “It’s going down all the time,” Verizon’s Hans Vestberg said. The shift reflects a cooling labor market, in which bosses are gaining an ever-stronger upper hand, and a new mindset on how best to run a company. Pointing to startups that command millions of dollars in revenue with only a handful of employees, many executives see large workforces as an impediment, not an asset, according to management specialists. Some are taking their cues from companies such as Amazon.com, which recently told staff that AI would likely lead to a smaller workforce. A new Wall Street Journal article recaps some of the recent headcount cuts, with Amazon layoff of 14,000 (initially mis-reported by Reuters as 30,000) driving a new set of press sightings: The nation’s largest employers have a new message for office workers: help not wanted. Amazon.com said this week that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs, with plans to eliminate as much as 10% of its white-collar workforce eventually. United Parcel Service UPS 1.14%increase; green up pointing triangle said Tuesday that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after the retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. Earlier in October, white-collar workers from companies including Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors TAP -2.43%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips—or learned that they would come soon. Added up, tens of thousands of newly laid off white-collar workers in America are entering a stagnant job market with seemingly no place for them… A leaner new normal for employment in the U.S. is emerging. Large employers are retrenching, making deep cuts to white-collar positions and leaving fewer opportunities for experienced and new workers who had counted on well-paying office work to support families and fund retirements. Nearly two million people in the U.S. have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, according to recent federal data. Behind the wave of white-collar layoffs, in part, is the embrace by companies of artificial intelligence, which executives hope can handle more of the work that well-compensated white-collar workers have been doing. Investors have pushed the C-suite to work more efficiently with fewer employees. Factors driving slower hiring include political uncertainty and higher costs. Altogether, these factors are remaking what office work looks like in the U.S., leaving the managers that remain with more workers to supervise and less time to meet with them, while saddling the employees fortunate enough to have jobs with heavier workloads. The cascade of restructurings has created a precarious feeling for managers and staff alike. It is also tightening the options for those who are looking for employment. Around 20% of Americans surveyed by WSJ-NORC this year said they were very or extremely confident that they could find a good job if they wanted to, lower than in past years. Mind you, this is not the first time we have seen this movie, but this time, the production promises to be on an unprecedented scale. For instance, tarting in the 1980s, big companies started greatly thinning their corporate centers. The leveraged buyout wave precipitated this shift. Raiders targeted over-diversified conglomerates, which tended to be over-manned at their head offices, breaking them up and reducing need for big bureaucracies to ride herd on the operations. Many companies greatly trimmed the size of these activites to make themselves less attractive as prey. The rise of personal computers and improved management information systems facilitated this shift. It also became common simply to fire managers and require the survivors to do what had formerly been one and a half or even two jobs. Similarly, the outsourcing of tech jobs to foreign body shops and H1-B holders may not have reduced headcounts overall (Robert Cringley claims total manning increased) but did make it well-nigh impossible to land an entry level job in software at large companies, as over two decades of frustrated new graduates seeking advice at Slashdot attests. For another summary (with a preview of broader implications, which we’ll discuss later), see this Breaking Points segment: Signs of Weakening AI Demand Due Given all the wonderous things AI is supposedly able to do, a slackening of demand would seem to reflect performance shortfalls. Admittedly these data points are indicative as opposed to dispositive: Hartley, Jolevski, Melo, and Moore have been tracking GenAI use for Americans at work since December 2024. They find that GenAI use fell to 36.7% of survey respondents in September 2025 from 45.6% in June. I wonder if OpenAI, Google or Anthropic are seeing a similar decline… https://t.co/hjnss5u6vj — Erik Brynjolfsson (@erikbryn) October 22, 2025 A must-read post by Gary Marcus contains more contra-hype signtings. For instance: 3. This also fits with this graph from Apollo Global Management’s Chief Economist Torsten Slok, based on Census Data, from early September: 4. TechCrunch just reported that “ChatGPT’s mobile app is seeing slowing download growth and daily use” based on data from Apptopia Even with these signs of more and more dogs rejecting the AI dogfood, the C Suite is still heavily populated with true believers. As we indicated above, AI might not have to work well to suit their purposes. In most types of goods and services, crapification has become the norm. Customer service and product qualty too often stink. So the top brass may feel, particularly in a world of too many big incumbents (as in few alternative providers), that they can degrade their offerings further at no/minimal risk. What Happens as the Gutting of the Middle Class Accelerates? Cynics might point out that office workers are finally being hosit on their own petard. They participate in, or at least did not object to, the outsourcing and offshoring of US jobs. We have pointed out that in many, arguably most, the business case was weak, even before factoring in the increase in risk due to greater complexity and dependence on outside contractors. But it made perfect sense if you viewed outsourcing as mainly intended to increase the pay and authority of executives and middle managers at the expense of hourly/lower level workers. One of the big rationalizations of the AI boom, from an economic perspective, is that the implementation of new technology increases prosperity on a broad basis. Aside from ignoring externalities like pollution and the fact that these big changes produce winners and losers, and the winners seldom ameliorate the damage done to the losers, the idea that incomes rise isn’t even always true. The Industrial Revolution in England ushered in at least a generation (and according to some studies two generations) of declining living standards. Victorian workhouses were one indicator of how bad conditions became for those in the lower orders who failed to find employment. In Europe, living standards have already been falling due to the sanctions-induced energy shock producing de-industrialization, as in job losses and pay cuts, in tandem with higher consumer power costs and often increased food expenses due to climate change reducing agricultural output. And that’s before getting to reductions in social safety nets due to falling tax revenues (see Russia sanctions blowback), turbo-charged by commitments to militarize even as the US trade wars are adding to economic damage. In the US, while power costs are not dire (although the AI is increasing electrical bills and more is in the offing), food, housing, and medical expenses are high and generally rising. And tariff costs are kicking in as many producers have exhausted inventories stockpiled before Liberation Day. A new Financial Times story confirms that the young, traditionally the most employable, are hardest hit: Income growth in the US has slowed to a near-decade low, with young workers especially hard hit, in a sign American consumers are struggling with a weakening labour market and persistent inflation. Real income growth for workers aged between 25 and 54 this year dropped to its slowest pace — excluding periods of pandemic volatility — since the 2010s when the 2008 financial crisis led to high levels of unemployment, according to new research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The slowdown is the latest sign of an increasingly distressed US labour market, and comes as Federal Reserve officials are expected to cut rates on Wednesday. George Eckerd, co-author of the report, told the Financial Times: “We’re looking at a level of year-on-year growth that’s actually similar to [the 2010s] when the labour market was a lot weaker and the unemployment rate was higher.” “Inflation is eating into otherwise decent levels of pay gains,” he added. Keep in mind that the measure of inflation impacts the real income computation. Most experts consider inflation to be understated; measurement have been repeatedly jiggered to produce lower results so as to reduce the disbursements for cost-of-living adjustments, as well as for political purposes. So a higher inflation figure would lower the level of real income, and probably push the claimed growth into contraction, consistent with the lived experience of most Americans. There are big implications if the US middle class suffers a big leg down in its size and health. For starters, many, particularly the young, took on student debt to go to college and get a “good” job. But employers are now playing musical chairs, except they suddenly removed all the seats save one. What happens when even more fall behind on payments and are hit with penalty interest rates? And even putting aside the pernicious effect of student debt, young adults with low and erratic incomes means more living with parents, less household formation (econ speak for getting married and having kids), less home buying. The much-lowered value of a college degree will blow back to universities in terms of less competition for admission, save at the very top schools, and likely lower enrollment overall. If more parents are telling their kids to become plunbers or painting contractors or HVAC techs, that will also somewhat unwind the Elizabeth Warren “two income trap” phenomenon of parents bidding up housing in school districts seen as being advantaged in college admissions terms. In the modern era, in societies that do not have religions that justify yawning class/income differences, a combination of rising income levels, the perception of elite comptence, which includes at least some concern for the welfare of the lower orders, and class mobility have been the bulwark of legitimacy. All these pillars are crumbing in the US. In the Breaking Points segment above, Saagar Enjeti suggested that the AI revolution, if it lives up to its hype, could foment an actual revolution by producing two conditons considered to be key to the Russian revolution: declining living standards and elite overproduction. Based on the flaccidness of the No Kings protests, which had significant middle/upper middle class representation, I don’t see it. The impediements include atomization and weak social ties, the perception that protests with muscle (as that entail a real risk of police thuggery in response) are the province of losers like union workers (and there is also perilous little knowledge what early labor protestors endured to secure basic workplace protections). More practically, in our high survellance/recordkeeping state, organizing and participating in demonstrations, or worse, being arrested, is sure to be a job prospect killer. So many of the newly-downtrodden quite rationally may conclude that they can’t afford to take a personal stand. As for elite overproduction being a factor that will amplify protest, given the lack of competence of our elite incumbents, yours truly is not optimistic that those who put themselves on education tracks for those roles are any more able to manage their way out of a paper bag….or organize a revolt. Again, to use the analogy of the early Industrial Revolution, the enclosure movement, which shifted formerly self-sufficient farmers to factories and cities, did produce William Blake’s “dark Satanic mills” and the eventual 1848 revolts across Europe. However, depending on which historian you believe, that upheaval was either ineffective or produced only some concessions from the ruling classes in terms of improved social protections. But it did not upend the existing order. That is not to say some sort of dislocation of the existing order is not baked in. But I don’t see it as being something as Manichean or potentially decisive as a revolution. If not a full-bore Jackpot, it’s likely to have an anachic flavor of a big increase in dysfunction, disorder, and desperation. _____ 1 This move was not altruistic, as some like to pretend. Ford found it hard to find and keep assembly line workers. The jobs still required training yet were tedious and restrictive. Ford found he had to pay his men well in order to have his factories operate on a high uptime basis. But his and other carmakers hiring (on similar employment terms) was on such a scale as to create a massive pool of blue collar elite that could afford to buy cars. To be fair, the corporate hiring frenzy during the pandemic was too much. They could be cutting jobs and just putting AI into their announcements so Wallstreet loves them more. Also, if you look at FRED data, median household income has been flat since 2020. The big gains were in the last Trump admin and the end of the Obama administration. So at the median its been no gain for about five years. In IT I think this is most of the story, and may even be most of it. The factors seem to be: – reverse to the mean after the pandemic hiring. – responding to a general slowdown in the economy. – the collapse of the VC ‘app’ economy. AI is in the mix, but IT is a hype driven industry. There’s always some stupidity complicating hiring. AI seems more like an excuse for lowering the cost of wages, not so much the head count: “Amazon perhaps faces the most scrutiny. US Citizenship and Immigration Services data showed that Amazon sponsored the most H-1B visas in 2024 at 14,000, compared to other criticized firms like Microsoft and Meta, which each sponsored 5,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. Senators alleged that Amazon blamed layoffs of ‘tens of thousands’ on the ‘adoption of generative AI tools,’ then hired more than 10,000 foreign H-1B employees in 2025.” https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ If you see a recession coming, you can blame AI for the layoffs, and look like a successful innovator rather than a struggling business. There are actually two AI technologies in play, and while they’re related, they have important differences. One is LLMs/generative models (same thing essentially), the other is Machine Learning. While Machine Learning has been massively over hyped, it is still very useful and has many practical purposes. China is investing heavily in this, and its strengths are in control engineering such as industrial processes, logistics and complex engineering. It has limitations (self-driving cars are probably impossible), is not intelligent, requires a ton of training, but used appropriately is very powerful. LLMs are really just smart text complete. They’re very good at spotting patterns, and then creating facsimiles of those patterns (forgeries essentially). But they’re limited by their training data (which by necessity must be incomplete), complexity (which means above a certain point they require huge amounts of energy and time, for diminishing returns – and there’s not much to be done about that) and the accuracy of those training them (underpaid graduates in the Philippines and Eastern Europe – best I can tell). This makes LLMs good for repetitive office jobs, where accuracy isn’t critical, the outputs don’t vary significantly and where the cost of the work justifies a couple of nuclear power stations. That stuff exists (marketing, a lot of low level translation stuff), but its a comparatively small market. For programming, even if this tech works (and it doesn’t really), the cost of the tools for a single developer are going to be more than that developer’s salary, for output that’s essentially similar to a mediocre intern and you still need that developer to supervise. The economics just don’t add up once the VC subsidies disappear. This makes Uber look sane. Following up on this, a couple of additional points > Even with these signs of more and more dogs rejecting the AI dogfood, the C Suite is still heavily populated with true believers. I think it’s always important to remember that many members of the C Suite are not terribly bright and have only a limited understanding of what is happening on the shop floor. They also tend to be terrible with technology – even CIOs, at least in my experience, do not actually know much about IT. They will go to conferences aimed at CIOs, listen to podcasts and read the media selling stuff to them. And then cravenly try to do what everyone else is doing, so even if they fail (and the majority of IT projects fail), they can point to ‘industry trends’. When it comes to technology, the corporate class are sheep. Nobody wants to be the odd guy out. Senior execs, even at places at Amazon, tend to be bad at identifying which jobs matter. For years corporate America has been dreaming of eliminating their IT department, and there have been many failed attempts. The original outsourcing boom of the 90s (which mostly failed) was an attempt to do this. Developers are expensive, tend to fail more than they succeed (the IT failure rate should be a scandal) and to the MBA class, in ways that accountants or sales people, are not. When it comes to AI, I think its sweet spot is ‘bullshit jobs’. As someone who’s been marketing adjacent for much of their career, I’ve always been struck by how this is essentially a facts free zone. Does marketing work? Nobody knows. How would you measure that. Even if AI made marketing worse, would it matter? And I’m sure there are other jobs with lots of unnecessary work that could be automated easily enough, even if the results were garbage (a lot of corporate translation work has always been very low quality, to give an example). Where it will do a lot of damage is in areas where those making the decisions (the c-suite) do not actually understand the work that is being done. This is already happening in IT (the next Y2K will be cleaning up the slop being generated by AI tools), and I’m sure there are other areas such as accounting where all kinds of errors are creeping in without anyone realizing. In addition, as people get used to AI (and I’ve observed this directly), they stop checking the work. I forsee a lot of corporate disasters over the next few years caused by AI slop due to cost cutting. I also forsee some interesting conversations in the next few years as companies are forced to pay the true cost for AI tools… re: the C-suite, I agree 100%. Upper management at my company talks about AI so much that sometimes it seems like they are glitching. But you can tell that above a certain level they really don’t know what they are talking about. But my company is owned by one of the biggest private equity companies who in turn are heavily invested in AI companies, data centers, and the power generating to run them. So senior execs at my company are in turn just being pummeled at every turn by our PE overlords with the AI directive. No one gets fired for buying AI is the new “no one gets fired for buying IBM” (for now). I hadn’t considered the PE angle, but you’re absolutely right. When this implodes, we’re going to see the mother of all hangovers as the entire corporate class realize they’ve blown a decade’s worth of investment capital on a chimera. Heh, but it ain’t their money. I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone. Wouldn’t it be nice to use that giant hand to squeeze Bezos’s head while asking him nicely to not fire thousands of employees? Just spitballing here I’m a specialist in measurable forms of marketing (direct mail, email, websites) who just got drummed out of his career after 40 years by a contracting employer with a bullsh*tter as its marketing chief. Yes, marketing is measurable. It’s actually quite simple in principle: You measure what happens because of your campaign against a baseline of what happened without it, or what happened versus an alternative. Problem is, many of the best-paid people in marketing have fat paychecks based on pretending that it isn’t. And their clients play along, for reasons as simple as not knowing any better, as human as fearing they’ll be the next ones fired if they dissent, and as vain as finding TV shoots a glamorous experience. As for CEOs, their reaction is the same as it was to the gutting of internal IT or customer service. It doesn’t affect them personally, the outsource vendor makes a really seductive-sounding presentation on how it cuts their cost and goes straight to the bottom line that pegs the CEO’s pay, and he gleefully signs off on it. The resulting tech support/customer experience/marketing is ineffective and awful, but the quarterly report looks great and the CEO doesn’t care because he’ll cash out before the company craters. I’ve told friends that my marketing skills make me feel like a Latin scholar. I have all this knowledge that would still work, but in an era when no one else knows or cares how to hear it. Your observations are spot on. I started programming and writing documentation (and, sigh, managing programmers) back in 1977 at a large high tone university. I didn’t have a degree in IT, but at the time the ambient attitude among the experienced programmers was that “if you need to study this stuff, you’re probably not very good.” And as more IT grads came along things got worse and worse, i.e, the quality of work I could expect from the people I was supervising just kept deteriorating. There were two major factors to which I attributed this deterioration. One was that academia took over the field and the produced a generation of people whose approach to career success was to appear clever, or “ingenius” and never put in the time to sweat all the details that determine the effectiveness of any piece of software. This became more and more true as the crucial components of quality control were increasingly removed from IT experienced senior programmers and taken over by non IT supervisory people or, if you will, the customers. During the 80s I saw much of the programming industry as a kind of hollow jobs program for largely unqualified people. The second factor was the eagerness of non IT senior executives to demand a larger role in how IT was to be implemented. And these people were red meat for the hordes of software and hardware sales crews who descended upon them. I recall telling a highly placed young and eager assistant comptroller that he didn’t need to spend $250K on a new computer whose purchase he’d advocated since what he wanted to get done was a an essentially trivial exercise using some basic software already in place. The most shocking part of that conversation was that he hadn’t realized that the old IBM MVS system could actually do arithmetic. I kid you not, and such episodes were legion. AI could be used to accomplish many useful things, but in the hands of decision makers who lack a deep understanding of its horizons and limitations, the prospects are dubious. there is still a strong belief in what remains of the american middle and upper-middle class that trumpismo (including AI, crypto, ICE, the whole sordid package) is simply a bizarre aberration and that “soon” things will snap back to the neoliberal status quo of our youth. nobody’s gonna risk everything on mass action if they think the sun will be back out in ’28, and even if they broadly sympathize with the cause they’d rather other folks take the risk. it should also go without saying that even if power was found lying in the street, nobody on the soi-disant american left would pick it up. this is a good point. you can really see this in every candidate the dems are floating for 2028: they are not even trying to adjust to this new landscape. i think more likely, we will get more institutionally destructive maga type people in power. maybe with the occasional switch to dems in power, but they fundamentally lack the ability to reverse any of the changes made. it’s just going to be a slow nonlinear decline until something breaks. when things will break enough for mass action is the question. i sound like a bit of a doomer here, but i don’t mean to be hopeless. acquisition of enough power to change things is a slow and arduous process, realistically it will take time to organize and build alternative structures. the best thing to do for now imo is to quietly build alternative structures so when collapse gets bad, there is a decent alternative lined up in place. and minimize damage caused. imo. the problem, of course, is that the reactionary right has the church. labor used to have the union hall as a counterweight, and many mainline churches were (and are) decently liberal but with the rise of evangelical politics that door has mostly shut. folks these days are atomized and have zero mentorship in how to lead a movement. the soviet russian rank and file were the vanguard of revolution; maybe if troops here don’t get paid for enough months they’ll wise up. but i doubt it. So is the way to square this circle that AI actually does not perform well, save as a weapon in class warfare? For LLMs, I’m going with yes. This is class warfare and the ego-mad fever dream of what Ed Zitron calls business idiots. It won’t just be a gutting of middle class jobs, the executives will be going as well. Especially since the executive role is symbolic anyway, perhaps the most non-essential of anyone in the org – more so given there are very few real leaders anymore who drive success with charisma and contribution. Their role is merely to be the public or legal face of the org, the signature, the talking head, but since when was a CEO legally liable or responsible for anything? It become an obsolete legal construct. And the BBC has with their AI generated news anchor shown what corporations can do with the C-suite, have they not? I had a prof once who, by way of introduction to programming languages, used the peanut butter and jam sandwich as an example. There is a repeated pattern to the making of the sandwich, and programming is all about capturing to a logic language that repeated pattern, which can then be interfaced with the real world in some way. This was not said, nor intended by the prof, but think about this – any work which is repetitive in any way can be replaced with an algorithm. Therefore, even without AI or LLM, most modern roles being highly repetitive in nature could be replaced with an algorithm. But as mister Musk has learned, humans are highly adaptive and can handle unexpected outcomes better than AI. Musk, he of the aforementioned c-suite? A little more low-tech anecdote—-did rounds at the nearby tech/industrial park, full of the US equivalent of Mittelstand. Only 2 firms (say 16%) had receptionists. everyone else had locked doors and you were met at the door by your party. …which makes utilitarian sense, but still culturally jarring from being used to an environment in which every self-respecting firm had their own receptionist that greeted you when you exited the elevator. lmao. There has been a generational change in what constitutes an “essential” employee, and even the weak-sauce LLM-driven AI is going to accelerate that change. After listening to a interview with Sam Corcos the other day, I’m getting the feeling that the Tech Bros. have decided that their ‘Move fast and break things.’ method is ready for deployment, (Outside of their ‘lane’ so to speak.) I think that’s a dangerous notion. In the wider world, there are all sorts of dangerous pitfalls in breaking things you don’t understand how to fix, or things you don’t have a replacement for. Sam Corcos, Trump’s Chief Technology Officer for Treasury, left me with the distinct impression that the ultimate ( If unstated ) intent of the DOGE program, besides making Peter Theil the anti-christ, is to take control of the government’s procurement system as a whole, in the same manner that they took over USAID’s . After chasing the current population of hogs away from that trough, they intend to put ‘procurement’ under much tighter control, and in my opinion, that means a simple re-direct of all that money into a different set of pockets. The trouble as I see it, is a lot of their plan seems to include ‘Hope,‘ the hope that they can clean up the mess that not knowing enough about the stuff they are about to break is going to cause. Hope is not a tactic…. and all that. Which brings me to the massive recent lay-offs by big tech firms; What the he*l were all those tens of thousands of people doing before they got fired? I think the Tech Bros. are ‘Hoping‘ to demonstrate the immense productivity gains possible with AI. This demonstration could be likened to a monster raise in the betting on a poker hand, IOW, what if the big bet, is a bluff. ‘Demonstrate‘ to the investor class, and all your potential customers that AI is already generating gigantic increases in productivity in your businesses, (look at the layoffs) it will do it for you too. Did the Tech Bros. really replace tens of thousands of important employees with AI? It’s hard for me to think they had tens of thousands of un-important people on their payroll? It’s also hard for me to think that whatever all those people were doing, is now being done really well by AI. “Did the Tech Bros. really replace tens of thousands of important employees with AI?” In short, no. See me comment above with reference to this article: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ Well of course they are. Thank you. The thing is, its not hope for them. They are simply ignorant of systemic effects because the position they occupy in the Neoliberal dispensation has, to date, never been charged for its costs, its always unloaded those costs on “society” which, per Margret Thatcher, they don’t believe exists anyway. Society doesn’t exist, climate change is a hoax, money is digital token. Judge them by what they do, but bear in mind their utter disconnection from reality. I can tell you that by the time I was consulting for Google in 2016 management had no idea what most of the people there were doing, but their margins were so fat no one yet cared. The sooner they break everything, the sooner we get to start picking up the pieces. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an ameliorist not and accelerationist, but the foundation has been completely devoured by the Neoliberal termites and the sooner the real fall starts the more will be left to catch it. RE: It’s hard for me to think they had tens of thousands of un-important people on their payroll In a sane world, they wouldn’t. But we live in the stupid timeline. Give Graeber’s Bulls*it Jobs a read sometime. He describes how in the corporate world, the more minions a manager has, the more important that manager is. So there is incentive to have a staff full of people who don’t do anything. I may have even witnessed this myself…. This was on full display at Google in 2016-18 when I was in and out of their NY campus. Shortly thereafter they started firing people in droves by division. Big Fan of the antithesis: Move slow; Make things Comment of the day for me. Not heard that before but I love it. I will share widely Exactly! Thank you. I’m not necessarily well informed about AI, but I think it is 99% hype. What they call AI is not ‘intelligence’ but is merely super-computing. Stoking fear about AI taking over jobs serves to make workers (even if their jobs are actually perfectly safe from AI) more compliant and more exploitable. I’ve seen videos of how AI may take over the world and cause human extinction. There was a click bait story about how AI tried to murder a human when it believed a human was trying to deactivate it. The concept of an all powerful AI being is ludicrous. AI is a machine, and machines require electric components and electricity to operate. The idea that somehow AI is going to defend itself, repair itself and ensure a constant power supply to itself to prevent being shut down is fantasy. AI is never going to be invincible to having it’s very life shut off by a human cutting it’s circuits or otherwise immobilizing it as there are 1001 ways to kill a machine, even with bare hands. So no, I’m not buying into the fear and hype. Stoking fear about AI taking over jobs serves to make workers (even if their jobs are actually perfectly safe from AI) more compliant and more exploitable. I think this is the most likely impact. Threaten workers with pay cuts, more workload and if they don’t like it, use the fear of AI as a stick. There is still a lot of butt hurt over the short-lived, sporadic displays of worker bargaining power that happened during the beginning of Covid. Someone on Bloomberg suggested that AI not tight money is cause for new structural UE. In my under grad we used slide rules. The calculator and PC did not replace many engineers, but slide rule engineers have a better feel for the math under the solution. To give positive ROI for the trillions or so in AI bubble building, much of it bleeding edge rapidly evolving HW and SW they will have to replace a huge sum of salary. Some of these headlines concern the sales pitch. Long way to go to see an exorbitantly trained LLM compete with a human. AI absolutely will decimate white collar jobs. And AI absolutely isn’t ready to do that today. Making an analogy to relational databases, a concept generated by IBM in the 1970s, it took a decade from the creation of the idea to a working model by Oracle. It then took another decade for the world to adopt them and create valuable, usable products. LLMs are a result of the idea of the “transformer” (the T in ChatGPT) invented by a small team at Google in 2019. Transformers are what made LLMs actually seem to produce valuable information suddenly. And they really do for a lot of use cases. Over time, companies will move from LLMs to much more specialized models for more specific use cases, and an array of products will get created based on those specialized models and needs. Like relational databases, this will take a couple of decades. Once created though, the decimation process will proceed fairly quickly. I expect to hear a lot of RIF announcements every year for a while. Then I expect a massive cascade, resulting in some form of political chaos. They may produce valuable information. In practice what LLMs often create is the illusion of valuable information. Did a quick search on “ai generated entity relationship diagram”. Got plenty of results. No idea how good any of these are. I volunteer on an open-source software project. Only a handful of motivated devs (working in C++). We’ve been using CoPilot for code reviews and lately added Claude. IMO both add value, but you can’t just blindly accept the recommendations. Claude seems to me a bit more polished in that it does some ego-stroking of the dev and provides some cueing like “green checkmarks” to bolster its approval. They are kind of impressive in how they can go from C++, to cmake files, to language translation, to doxygen which would be hard for an individual dev to do. Over time I think their use will improve the code base (much of the core was built via hacker culture without much maintainability thought). We may have reached peak AI, at least in terms of growth of use of the seemingly dominant type, large language models, which are conflated with “generative AI” (sticklers are encouraged to clear up fine points in comments). As someone on the inside let me explain this more in layman’s terms. There are an immense number of models that can be used to perform generative AI, ML, and adjacent tasks. They come in tiny, massive, open source, commercial, free but closed source, and many other variants. They are capable of a whole range of tasks but generally speaking they take some input (an image, a natural-language string of text, links to additional files, video data, etc) and do something autonomously with it to create an output (create a new image, categorize objects in video and provide in list/tag form, generate an explanation based on the input and what the model was trained on, etc). The big leap in capabilities from earlier iterations of this type of thing come from the flexibility in taking the input in natural human language instead of using a formally structured query language. What takes all the focus in the current debate are the current generation of US frontier models, which are the biggest and ‘most capable’ when it comes to general use tasks. These are the OpenAI GPT series and Anthropic’s Claude series. These models were likely trained on the contents of the majority of the public internet and a lot of copywritten or non-copywritten but previously assumed to be protected data, like the uploads on Youtube or torrents of books or pornography. The training data of these models is not made public but since both companies have had to pay out for copyright infringement it can be assumed they did not ask before using the data to train their models which they turn around and sell usage of for revenue; their gamble apparently was that the sort of ‘fair use’ that a human might do (read a book, watch a video) is the same as training a LLM. The training data was required because the idea is these models are to be used for anything the end users might want (“It explains! It codes! It categorizes! It can even translate ancient Akkadian documents!”). The idea apparently behind these massive general purpose models apparently was, if it is big enough and good enough fast enough, we can corner the market before other countries get there. And the revenue model was, if it’s powerful enough for a lot of general use cases, APIs can be used to build out other applications downstream. Those applications would pay API usage fees and their products would be dependent. What has happened instead is that the downstream application layers are building in model-agnosticism for redundancy and cost control reasons. There are so many other options! And what has been discovered is in a lot of cases the general use frontier models aren’t as good as something smaller and hyper-focused on a specific use case. Right now what is happening is for viable use cases, new models – smaller, faster, cheaper, more focused on a specific niche – are being developed and taking over usage from the GPTs and Claudes. “Generative AI” is an offshoot of the above. It is a specific type of use case that leverages output that is created by a model. Like with other use cases, models very specific to a use case are being developed because the frontier models are either too expensive or their training data makes the output of questionable value to a company looking to use the output in their own products. Right now the legal landscape on this is murky. Works that are ‘fully AI generated’ can’t hold copyright and if it can be proven something was generated by a company using an LLM that used fraudulently-obtained training data, the company can be sued and held liable. This is holding up the next phase of the use cases, which are in VFX, animation and video editing and probably music (the first one was software development/coding assistants, the second one is also going to roll out as plugins/extensions to existing editing tooling – this is why right now all those software are pushing unwanted extensions/features of this type – they’re market testing while they do private development). I suspect some deals have been made to get the legal situation ‘resolved’ given the huge amount of activity I’ve been seeing in my work around use cases in that area and the fact that OpenAI is publicly talking about music generation models. Yes, this has been my take on it, although I’m definitely farther from daily usage than you are. But it seems like smaller, domain specific models, are going to be the future. And I think that calls into question the massive buildout of capacity, which seems like it’s unnecessary. I can actually generate pretty-good single speaker transcripts from video with a locally run model on a CPU (non-AI ready), about 25 minutes for 2.5 hours of video. I’m kind of amazed. My larger concern is the entirety of the world is getting blazed by endless AI-generated garbage, on an order of magnitude worse than the spam wars of the early 2000s. What OpenAI is trying to do, tie in LLMs with all kinds of low/no friction transactions and in-app advertising, seems like a hellscape of a world to live in, if it becomes unescapable. And I think that calls into question the massive buildout of capacity, which seems like it’s unnecessary. Something to consider about the build out is that in a lot of cases a particular company is restricted to a specific data center availability zone because of location, prior agreements, other workloads running concurrently, or security requirements. (A big one is security certifications for something like federal or military projects in the US, or GDPR country-specific data requirements in the EU). This means that while the buildout overall might be excessive there will be local restrictions and shortages that mask it. The availability in the data centers around northern Virginia and London, for example, are currently very tight on the cheaper GPU capacity because of proximity to DC gov and London financial services and the associated security certifications required. Even these industries, which have more money than God, balk at paying several hundred thousand a year for an 8-gpu H200 instance running full time. So L240S capacity is exceeded first then they move up to H100 and beyond as those become unavailable. My larger concern is the entirety of the world is getting blazed by endless AI-generated garbage, on an order of magnitude worse than the spam wars of the early 2000s. The next generation of use cases are particularly terrifying on that front because there is a lot of text-to-speech and generative voice as a service being built out. Ostensibly for things like transcription services or the anticipated wave of gen-video that is usable for commercial and advertising needs (and the associated need for gen-audio/voices/speech with voice cloning), all I can think when I look at the API spec is that I need to warn my parents not to believe any sudden urgent calls of any type claiming to be me or any of their friends begging for them to send money to help them with a crisis. Scam spam at scale, as a service for a mere $22/mo. That’s what I was thinking when I couldn’t sleep the other night. Watch out. If you have any digital presence at all, a few minutes of work and someone can extort you for very real looking adult activities with a minor. Only needs to fool some of the people. And BTC makes it easier than ever. Sigh. I came across a YT post on Sim farms. The secret service busted a large sim farm. Scary indeed. https://youtu.be/FIgdXah-VuE?si=6VRTA_p17sKBCcu3 Thank you. I’m still giving some weight to the idea that much of this desire is driven by what has happened with workplace relations (and other effects) since the beginning of the Covid era. Look at the timing. LLMs, the “AI” moniker, etc. had all been around before 2020. In the Breaking Points segment above, Saagar Enjeti suggested that the AI revolution, if it lives up to its hype, could foment an actual revolution by producing two conditons considered to be key to the Russian revolution: declining living standards and elite overproduction. Based on the flaccidness of the No Kings protests, which had significant middle/upper middle class representation, I don’t see it. I concur. I would argue though that the most likely outcome is the complete collapse of the social contract, producing what I can only imagine would be a Hobbesian outcome, which, given the amount of guns around, perhaps will be represented in rampant banditry and things of that nature. Maybe a better example would be 90s Russia, even if I suspect Russia was much better prepared for its collapse than the US is now. Though her work isn’t particularly scholarly, Svetlana Alexievich offered some examples in The Last of the Soviets which were not pretty. “For instance, tarting in the 1980s, big companies…” I think you meant to write, “starting”. Then again…… Here is an example of how Agentic AI is being sold: https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents.html Here is a handy calculator for economic value: https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents/roi-calculator.html/ I have no relationship with the vendor in this example, this is the simplest example of what is going on. Also, I have no idea how realistic this whole thing is, just sharing what is being passed around in these “efficiency” discussions. Service Now is a steaming pile of garbage. It’s enterprise software lol As the resident AI whisperer, on Agents: “Agentic AI” means multi-step workflows using an LLM to power each step of the action. It can be multiple LLM, like a specialized model just for finding the exact right location in a very large image or text file to insert something generated by a different model, like a block of code or a mask for editing frames in a video. The agent is ‘programmed’ depending on the framework/tool used and deployment mesh. For example, in coding assistants, agents can just be a multi-step chat, or they can run in the background based on guidelines saved in the workspace. They can trigger crazy unexpected LLM API charges; horror stories about unexpected 400$ bills from walking away from the computer for a few hours are usually from a poorly-designed agent. For example earlier today I was working on an agent to handle product ticket queues: – step 1, read the ticket; – step 2, search the existing items of work submitted by developers; – step 3, update a status on anything changed, which would trigger a separate workflow elsewhere; – step 4, review items in ‘completed’ state against original product spec; – step 5, search outstanding work to be done relative to the product spec for the completed work item and gather a list of remaining tickets that still needed work; – step 6, write a summary of current status and remaining work to be done on the product spec and pass it back to another system as an update. This agent is scheduled to run every hour and was requested so as to cut down on some admin work the product team is always behind on. Real developers will mutter this can be done with scripts and existing sprint dashboards, and they’re absolutely right. The difference is the ease in setup and maintenance since you don’t have to be a script maestro and have a million cron jobs running with access to a ton of internal services. The agents typically ship with a service mesh and an interface to program them that is visual and takes instruction in natural language and some kind of visual interface to map the workflow steps. They can also use Model Context Protocol servers, which are little programs that pass additional data/context back to the LLM as part of a prompt/step. MCP servers are often used to create connectors between various app services. Think pulling customer data from a CRM and summarizing a transcript from a customer call in a different system and the agent then drafts a customer status summary doc for an agent that is designed to act as a daily activity dashboard. Agents are probably one of the things that will get brutalized when the OpenAI/Anthropic part of the AI bubble pops (which I think is what most people conflate with the ‘AI bubble’ and fwiw I think are hyper overvalued). Right now they’re extremely buzzy so they’re popping up everywhere. They can be used to do stuff like web search in addition to working with internal systems so they have a lot of the same negative network effects on the public web as bots. So far I haven’t seen a really great use case for them that isn’t specific to big organization internal processes. Maybe autonomous research? We’ve been building one to maintain our product documentation based on our actual code internally at work – again the real software devs will huff and puff that docs from code as been around for years and they’re correct – again the difference here is scalability and ease of maintenance over time compared to the existing solutions. If ultimately they are only really useful for internal process automation they won’t need the massive expensive frontier models and cheaper models built into the service mesh will be developed instead. I can see them being useful in specific industry verticals as part of a full use case workflow (animation rigging, video editing, software qa validation) If they end up being useful on the public web, a better/improved standard for autonomous agent interaction with the public web will have to be developed. Already the internet is creaking under the load of the agent crawlers. I like your closing sentence. A naive question would be: what are “agent crawlers” doing? A second naive question would be: what will “agent crawlers” do,considering that they rely on the meager commons and roadkill left of the information highway.? Thank you for the continuing education RJ. Your explanations are clear for this layman, and you often cover the parts of the AI ‘thing’ I don’t hear about. Thanks. But replacing deterministic APIs with this. How can you reliably test these agents? There be dragons there. Using it for internal documentation, what could go wrong? It’ll miss that nuance. You noted these are wasteful as well. Brute forcing web pages to get all stuff better done with a structured API. This is the promise of true no code. Gonna be a debacle instead. For people who used to like mathew taibibi There seems to be a sharper knife available: Ladies and gentlemen coffeezilla You never know how things will pan out but the future looks bleak, Globalism and nationalism are done and they can’t decide who is in charge. Democracies are failing and the dictators are going to hell as well. But on a bright note their are 10,000 nuclear weapons sitting in the dark. What could go wrong with this picture. Chaos breeds over reach and chaos but our tech nightmare has just begun.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/30/2025 6:56:22 AM PDT by delta7 New and seasonal hires are typically announced during Q4. The opposite is unfolding amid stagflation. UPS announced that, despite favorable earnings, it has cut its operational workforce by 34,000 positions, greater than the initial estimate of 20,000, and an additional 14,000 positions from management. Shrinking a package delivery service ahead of the holiday season signals a broader trend. Artificial intelligence has been employed in operations to meet growing customer demand. The service has loosened its ties with Amazon, delivering 21.2% fewer packages than last quarter while demand during the first half of the year declined by 13%. Amazon itself will cut its workforce by 14,000 in the short term. Similar to UPS, the reduction in workforce is not a result of reduced earnings. A leaked memo also detailed that Amazon will need 600,000 fewer employees in the years to come. Careful rhetoric will surround the shift as people fear AI technology. As Amazon detailed in a blog post: “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Schumpeter BusinessCycle Waves of Creative Destruction This is Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction at play. Innovation is paving the way for new technology while leaving the past behind. Amazon itself and online shopping paved the way for the destruction of the brick-and-mortar stores. By 2020, when the world shut down, consumers relied on the internet for most of their shopping. Amazon expanded by 625% from 2010 to 2020 and continues to grow. The Industrial Revolution expanded, and the Industrialists, led by the auto stocks, drove the 1929 bull market. The invention of the combustion engine led to tractors for farmers, disproving the theories of Malthus that humanity would starve as the population increased. He never understood the cycles of technology, yet he influenced Gates and the Rockefellers. As farmers had tractors, production increased while employment declined. Horse Carriage The horse and buggy were replaced with automobiles. As they expanded, the suburbs came alive. Suddenly, people could live in places without trains. The town I grew up in flourished because we had a train station, which enabled people to buy land and move out of the cities. The town I grew up in expanded further from the train station with the automobile. Creative Destruction Waves cause unemployment to rise, but commerce expands. The shift from humans to AI is happening now. This will disrupt the system, but the world will adapt as it always does.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As Amazon detailed in a blog post: “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Schumpeter BusinessCycle Waves of Creative Destruction This is Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction at play. Innovation is paving the way for new technology while leaving the past behind. Amazon itself and online shopping paved the way for the destruction of the brick-and-mortar stores. By 2020, when the world shut down, consumers relied on the internet for most of their shopping. Amazon expanded by 625% from 2010 to 2020 and continues to grow. The Industrial Revolution expanded, and the Industrialists, led by the auto stocks, drove the 1929 bull market. The invention of the combustion engine led to tractors for farmers, disproving the theories of Malthus that humanity would starve as the population increased. He never understood the cycles of technology, yet he influenced Gates and the Rockefellers. As farmers had tractors, production increased while employment declined. Horse Carriage The horse and buggy were replaced with automobiles. As they expanded, the suburbs came alive. Suddenly, people could live in places without trains. The town I grew up in flourished because we had a train station, which enabled people to buy land and move out of the cities. The town I grew up in expanded further from the train station with the automobile. Creative Destruction Waves cause unemployment to rise, but commerce expands. The shift from humans to AI is happening now. This will disrupt the system, but the world will adapt as it always does.

Title: Amazon Cancels Its Lord Of The Rings MMO Amid Major Layoffs - Report

The company's latest Middle-earth project is scrapped as Amazon Games retreats from MMOs, struggling to find a fresh hook that could set its take on Tolkien's world apart. By Lan Pitts on October 30, 2025 at 7:42AM PDT Amazon has reportedly cancelled its second attempt at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, following a new round of layoffs at Amazon Games. The news came from former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine, who revealed on LinkedIn that she and others working on the project had been let go (via Rock Paper Shotgun). This comes shortly after Amazon also announced it would stop developing New World, its colonial fantasy MMO, though servers will remain active until 2026. "It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here." This new Lord of the Rings MMO was first announced in 2023, after Amazon partnered with Embracer Group, the current owner of Middle-earth's rights. It was described as a "persistent open-world adventure" that would span events from The Hobbit through The Lord of the Rings. However, details about the game were scarce, and now it seems the project has ended before reaching the public. This follows Amazon’s first attempt in 2019, which collapsed in 2021 after a contractual dispute when its partner, Leyou, was bought by Tencent. Last August, Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann said part of the challenge had been finding the right "hook," something that would make a Lord of the Rings MMO stand out. He said the team didn't want to simply repeat what's already been done, noting that the long-running The Lord of the Rings Online (which launched in 2007 and still receives updates) already fills that space. Hartmann added that MMOs are "tough" to make because they’re expensive and require consistent new content to keep players satisfied--a big risk even for a company like Amazon. At the time, Hartmann also mentioned that Amazon Games is shifting away from being an MMO-only publisher, focusing more on other genres like action RPGs--such as the recently launched King of Meat. Meanwhile, The Rings of Power TV series continues separately, with its second season exploring Sauron's rise--a reminder that Amazon's Middle-earth ambitions remain alive, just not in MMO form.

Amid 14,000 job cuts across company. Amid reports Amazon has 'gutted' its video games division as part of 14,000 company wide job cuts earlier this week, one former developer has suggested its Lord of the Rings MMO has also been cancelled. On Tuesday, Bloomberg shared an internal memo to staff from Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) announcing "significant role reductions" across Amazon Game Studios. Boom added the job cuts were a result of the company's decision to halt a "significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs". Amazon is yet to reveal the exact number of employees affected within its games division. Following that announcement, impacted staff began announcing their departure from Amazon on social media, with the ensuing messages suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the still-unreleased Lord of the Rings MMO announced back in 2023 - were both impacted. However, a LinkedIn post by former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine suggests the Lord of the Rings MMO will now never see the light of day. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games," Amrine wrote, "alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)." If Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO is cancelled, it would mark the second such project to die a death under the company's watch. It previously announced a different Lord of the Rings MMO back in 2019, but scrapped it amid reports of a dispute with Chinese mega-corp Tencent. Eurogamer has contacted Amazon for comment on the fate of is more recent Tolkien MMO. As for New World, Amazon has now confirmed the MMO will no longer receive updates, but will remain playable for now. The company has guaranteed servers will remain live "through 2026" and promised to give "a minimum of six months' notice" before making changes that would impact its availability. More details on its future are due "in the coming months". New World: Aeternum PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning! Moving to a new city is hard enough, let alone with a couple of young kids. But a stay-at-home mom told BI her children were the key to making friends in a Houston suburb. It's the final story in a BI series that followed three people for a year to understand the realities of relocating your life. You can also read about a woman who was paid to move from Los Angeles to Georgia and a couple who changed coasts when one of them got into Harvard. In today's big story, Amazon's massive layoffs have people nervous about widespread culling in the white-collar workforce. How realistic are those fears? (And is AI really to blame for all of this?) I'm also hosting a live discussion on that very topic at 2 pm EST on YouTube. I'll be joined by our resident Amazon expert Eugene Kim and our workplace whiz Aki Ito. More details here. And if you have questions you want answered, shoot me an email here. What's on deck: Markets: The stock market usually loves November. Here's where to put your cash. Tech: Big Tech's AI spending knows no limit. Business: Who is in, and who is out, on Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package. But first, is that a canary? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. First came Amazon. Then came …? The dust is settling on the meteor-sized layoffs that hit Amazon this week. But concerns are already growing about another deep impact that could hit a wider swath of the white-collar workforce. As brutal as Amazon's 14,000 job cuts were, they don't make that much of a dent in the broader labor market, or even the tech giant's wider workforce that's roughly 1.6 million strong. But if Amazon opened the door for other companies to conduct layoffs of their own, some fear things could get ugly. So what would it take? About 20 more Amazon-sized layoffs would send the labor market off the rails, writes BI's Bartie Scott, Andy Kiersz, and Madison Hoff. That might feel a long way away, and in many ways it is, but it's also not out of the realm of possibility. After all, companies are known to follow the lead of their bigger peers. In late 2022, Meta cut 11,000 jobs to kick off its "Year of Efficiency" in 2023. The rest of corporate America took notes, and eventually, some 250,000 people were affected. Further complicating matters is the current lack of hiring. The "Great Freeze" has kept companies in a holding pattern, refraining from hiring or firing. But if companies start letting people go without replacing them, the somewhat resilient job market could start to show some real cracks. I know what you're thinking: Curse you, artificial intelligence!! AI has been the lead suspect following the autopsy of Amazon's recent cuts. I include myself in that group, as I wrote about the potential for an AI-led job apocalypse in yesterday's newsletter. But there's a counter-narrative to the AI-took-our-jobs take. As BI's Peter Kafka asks: Are we sure we're losing jobs to AI? Companies typically need to cite some reason for laying off thousands of employees. And since AI is the topic du jour that tech is now banking on, it's an easy scapegoat. What's the alternative? Executives acknowledge that they messed up? They admit they overhired when business was booming, and now they're being forced to adjust? "I see this as mainly a correction to pandemic-era dynamics rather than some new thing like AI that's striking these companies," Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, told Business Insider. Yea, I'd go with the AI excuse, too. 1. Amazon's stock consistently finished last in its Magnificent 7 cohort. Over the past five years, the retail giant's shares have been up 43%, but that's compared to Nvidia's 1,521% gain. And even trails the wider S&P 500. Meanwhile, investors are concerned Amazon is being outdone in the AI arms race. 2. The Fed cut rates for the second time this year. As anticipated, the central bank made a quarter-percent rate cut. On the plus side, borrowers could start feeling the relief. On the downside, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there are no guarantees another rate cut will come in 2025. 3. It's the most wonderful time … for stocks. November is historically the stock market's best month — and the odds are looking in favor of that this year, too. Bank of America shared its ideas for where to invest, based on 1. Five trillion reasons to smile. Nvidia became the first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, in part because of how much it's spending on data centers. It's the cherry on top of a very good week for CEO Jensen Huang, who saw his personal wealth increase by more than $17 billion. 2. Meta stock slides despite earnings beat. The stock plunged 9% in after-hours trading after Mark Zuckerberg's company reported that it paid a $16 billion one-time tax charge this quarter. It beat Wall Street's expectations but missed on earnings per share. 3. Talk of an AI bubble isn't slowing Big Tech. Google, Meta, and Microsoft all reported increased spending on AI infrastructure on Wednesday, raising guidance and signaling even higher investments in data centers and chips through 2026. Some investors, meanwhile, are debating whether the AI boom has become a bubble. 1. The boomer property tax revolt. Home values have skyrocketed, and property taxes have risen with them. Older Americans are sick of it — but eliminating property taxes would hurt millennials and Gen Z, who rely on the local services they fund. 2. Who's for and against Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday. Tesla shareholders are set to vote next week on the compensation plan that could potentially make Musk the world's first trillionaire. Here's where major shareholders like Cathie Wood, Wedbush Securities, and the New York State Retirement Fund stand on the proposal. 3. Protein is helping Starbucks bulk up its comeback. CEO Brian Niccol said offerings like protein cold foam and protein lattes were helping to drive turnaround efforts at the coffee chain. As a result, gains-minded rewards-program members are getting in the door more often. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Amazon will release its quarterly financial results after the stock market closes on Thursday, Oct. 30, just days after the company announced it’s laying off 14,000 employees as it scales its artificial intelligence efforts. Reuters initially reported that the number could be as high as 30,000. The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Andy Jassy, said in June that the company would reduce its labor force as it tries to increase its use of AI to do jobs that a human would normally do. The reductions are impacting the company’s logistics and payments, video games and cloud-computing teams. It's the company’s second round of layoffs this year. Amazon currently employs about 1.55 million people across the globe. The 14,000 estimated reductions account for 4% of the company’s corporate workforce of 350,000 personnel. In its upcoming earnings call, the company will also need to assuage investor concerns about Amazon Web Services (AWS) following a widespread outage on Oct. 20, which lasted several hours and impacted web services of high-profile clients like Snapchat and Ring. The company said the outage was caused by an issue with its Northern Virginia data centers. As earnings approach, here’s how to tune in. Amazon will report earnings following the stock market close on Thursday, Oct. 30. The company’s third-quarter financial report will be posted on its Investor Relations website. Investors can also access the conference call on the website, which is scheduled to take place at 5 p.m. ET. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to report earnings per share of $1.58 on revenue of $177.8 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. In last year’s third quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.43 and revenue of $158.9 billion. AWS is expected to generate $32.4 billion, which would be an 18% increase from the $27.5 billion in revenue reported at the same point last year. Online sales are expected to hit $67 billion in the third quarter, and advertising is expected to come in at $17.3 billion. In the second quarter, the company missed Wall Street expectations by reporting weaker-than-expected operating income and slow cloud sales growth. The company said it expected an operating profit of $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion in the third quarter and sales between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. Amazon traded up 0.46% on Wednesday, Oct. 29. Michelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY. Reach her at mdelrey@usatoday.com

Title: Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO looks doomed as former dev says we "would have loved it" amid thousands of layoffs

The "fledgling" game was in development When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Just yesterday, Amazon revealed that its four-year-old fantasy MMORPG New World would be coming to an end with no future DLC or updates planned – and now, it seems that its other in-progress Lord of the Rings MMO might've been axed as well. The news of the Lord of the Rings project's potential cancellation comes amid the thousands of Amazon Games layoffs, as former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine seemingly hints at it in a new LinkedIn post. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game," writes Amrine, notably going on to say, "y'all would have loved it." While this doesn't outright spell out the end of the Lord of the Rings MMO, its future doesn't sound very bright – if it still has one at all, that is. "It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," continues Amrine. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here." She concludes with a message to fellow Amazon Games devs: "It's been an honor to build alongside you." Said to still be in early development last year, with Amazon "still trying to find the hook," the Lord of the Rings MMO was admittedly a bit of an enigma. The company never gave out much information about it, aside from some tidbits on its production status and size – and it certainly sounded like it would've been big. "It's still early," Amazon Games lead Christoph Hartmann stated in 2024. "It's a big IP, it's a big game." There's no telling what condition the MMO is in right now, or whether any progress on it will go forward. I know I'll be keeping my own fingers crossed, especially as The Lord of the Rings Online enters its 18th year – there's only so much to do in-game, after all. GamesRadar+ has reached out to Amazon Games for comment and will update this story with the company's response. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more New World devs leave heartfelt tribute for players after Amazon starts sunsetting the fantasy MMO, and now I'm crying: "Thank you for so many stories" After spending years with her head in various fantastical realms' clouds, Anna studied English Literature and then Medieval History at the University of Edinburgh, going on to specialize in narrative design and video game journalism as a writer.

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The vote over Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package is almost upon us. Here's where key shareholders stand on it. Rundown But first, a stock getting crushed by its peers. Market musings You flip on Prime Video for Thursday Night Football and open your laptop. You need a few household items, so you navigate to Amazon and fill up your cart as you watch the game. Why not toss in a few other impulse buys? You've already paid your annual fee to ensure free shipping on basically everything the site offers. After the game you have your sights set on finishing "Reacher." Eager for more, you ask Alexa when the next season is supposed to come out. Combine this all-inclusive experience with the fact that AWS is the world's biggest provider of cloud infrastructure, and you have a situation where Amazon is dominating major aspects of your life. Surely this has translated to stock-market dominance? Well, not exactly. Amazon is actually by far the worst performer in the Magnificent 7 over the past five years. In fact, it's returned less than half of the benchmark S&P 500. The chart above functions as an "AI progress scorecard" of sorts. You have the industry kingmaker Nvidia on top, with by far the biggest return. Bringing up the rear is Apple and Amazon, the two most clear-cut AI laggards. One Wall Street analyst recently confirmed this for Amazon, saying it's "last place" in the AI cloud race. Amazon's position at the bottom adds some crucial context to its recent 14,000 AI-driven layoffs. Despite the fact that the company is everywhere, it's not translating into shareholder value on par with peers. Now, Amazon is telling its remaining workers to "lean in" on AI, suggesting that cost cuts are one avenue towards regaining market footing. It's also indicative of a new era of mega AI layoffs, where the companies lagging industry leaders Microsoft and Alphabet take bold steps to catch up. They need to free up cash to spend on AI experts and data centers, and that's coming at the expense of other areas. Amazon's mass layoffs raise the stakes for its quarterly earnings report, due after the bell today. AWS will be in the spotlight after multiple quarters of flagging sales growth. Perhaps not-so-coincidentally, AWS is also a business living in fear of more layoffs. Less than 1% of AWS in the US was impacted by this week's cuts, but employees told BI they think the ax will fall in early 2026. This all begs the question: Can Andy Jassy's lumbering giant job-cut its way back to glory? Even if the strategy works, Amazon still has a ways to go to rival its fellow AI competitors. There's nothing like a chart that perfectly encapsulates the dashed hopes and dreams of investors. In this case, we have the S&P 500 chart from Wednesday. The index immediately dove lower after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a December rate cut is "far from" a foregone conclusion. This was news to traders, who were pricing in a high likelihood of another 25-basis-point cut. Those odds have since tumbled. The S&P 500 came back after the initial knee-jerk move lower, but the overall point stands that the market — near record highs — is priced to perfection. If investors don't get exactly what they're expecting, tantrums like this will keep occurring. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Ravi Jaipuria, the founder and chairman of RJ Corp., an India-based conglomerate that spans food, beverage, healthcare, and education. The majority of his net worth comes from the subsidiary Varun Beverages, which is a PepsiCo franchisee that has more than 1 billion customers. Varun Beverages (and therefore Jaipuria) got a big boost from third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company reported revenue, net income, and EPS that handily beat analyst estimates, which sent shares up 9% in a single session. Other highlights of the report included the company's interest in expanding into alcoholic beverages, as well as an exclusive distribution pact with Carlsberg. The 9% share spike pushed Jaipuria's net worth to $13.7 billion, up from $12.5 billion at Tuesday's close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Forbes. He currently sits as the 206th-richest person in the world. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. Looking for a way to hedge against a potential AI bubble? Traditional wisdom says to reduce equity exposure and park some money in the fixed-income market. But with yields falling as the Fed cuts rates, Jason Browne, the founder of Alexis Investment Partners, has a better idea: buy momentum indexes. Momentum indexes like the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) overweight the stocks in the S&P 500 that are outperforming most recently. But there are a couple of catches. First, the indexes don't offer downside protection for quick market drawdowns, since they take time to adjust. Second, they don't work during cyclical bear markets when everything falls. But they are great for when one area of the market — like the tech sector — enters a lengthy rough patch. This is seen by some as an inevitability, with AI-stock valuations historically extended. Browne says that if investor expectations aren't met, we may see a repeat of the dot-com bubble, when tech stocks got beat up for a few years while other parts of the market stayed afloat. If that's the case, momentum strategies should benefit as they start to track new leaders, like they did during that era. Browne says that, during the period from 2000 to 2002, he worked at a firm whose momentum strategy provided a roughly-10% return while the rest of the market was melting down. It worked because it naturally rotated into more defensive names. "You're getting the opportunity to continue to ride this wave while it continues, but also have a built-in exit strategy if you believe that the kind of bear market that we're likely to potentially transition to at some point is more rotational in nature," Browne said. — Will Edwards The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

Title: Carter's Clothing Store To Close 150 Stores, Blames Trump's Policies

Yet another large American retailer - and iconic children's clothing company - is suffering huge losses due to Donald Trump's horrific economic policies. This time it is Carter's, the company behind OshKosh, Otter Avenue, Skip Hop and Carter's. They are closing 150 stores and conducting large scale mass layoffs of staff - and they are blaming Donald Trump's policies in part. Initially, they planned to close 100 stores, but that number rose to 150 recently. They said that tariffs were "largely to blame" for it's financial downfall, which is forcing them to take dramatic cost-cutting steps to save the company. Profits fell last quarters to $11.6 million. That is 80 percent LESS than the same quarter in 2024. Shocking. Carters expects the tariffs to cost between $200 million and $250 million annually. It would be impossible to absorb that level of cost internally and the economy - and customer wallets - are already stretched as far as possible. Raising costs on clothes and accessories for children would be difficult sell. In addition to the store closures, Carters will be laying off around 15% of it's office workforce, roughly 300 corporate positions. That will save the company $35 million. Clothing retailers have been hit particularly hard by Trump's tariffs, with numerous large chains announcing layoffs in the past few weeks. Target announced layoffs in MN while Amazon is laying off 30,000 workers. REI, Orvis and Eddie Bauer will also be closing stores. Tariffs played a role in REI and Orvis' decisions. This holiday season is going to brutal - customers are losing their jobs, the economy is tanking (for most of us not in the top 1%) and retailers are closing stores due to high costs.

Title: Amazon have reportedly cancelled their Lord Of The Rings MMO, again

"Y'all would have loved it", says former developer Amazon have cancelled their second attempt at a Lord Of The Rings MMO as part of recent mass layoffs, according to a now-former senior gameplay engineer at Amazon Games. The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she wrote. I've reached out to Amazon for comment. Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable. Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It met an unfortunate end in 2021 thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a "persistent open-world MMO adventure", spanning the events of The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project. "It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here." It's claimed that 14,000 people are losing their jobs as part of Amazon's latest cuts. Best of luck to everybody affected. At the risk of being twee, here is an encouraging aside from the books: "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach." If you're desperate to roam Middle-earth in company, Standing Stone and Daybreak's The Lord of the Rings Online is still trucking along with a small but steady audience, almost two decades since launch. The community's recent doings include finally accomplishing a pilgrimage of desperately underlevelled hobbits to Mount Doom.

With hiring largely frozen in the US, any uptick in firings could set off alarm bells. Just this week, Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs; Paramount laid off about 1,000; and UPS announced it's shrunk by thousands more than expected this year. It's still a drop in the bucket — in terms of both Amazon's overall head count and the broader economy — and there's no guarantee that a wave of companies will follow suit. The overall labor market has been averaging 1.7 million layoffs a month, and we're not in a recession yet. However, new jobs are hard to find these days, and companies are abuzz with reasons to trim head count. Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft have all cited AI in cuts. Plus, there's general tariff uncertainty, and a need to correct for pandemic overhiring. It's a swirl of factors that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is watching closely — especially as the government shutdown prevents the flow of official data. "You see a significant number of companies either announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they're talking about AI and what it can do," he said, in a Wednesday press conference following the latest interest-rate cut. "It takes some time for it to get in there," he added, referring to official government data, much of which is on hiatus during the government shutdown. "But we're watching that really carefully." Have you been laid off or a hiring manager who has seen the workplace change? Reach out to this reporter to share at mhoff@businessinsider.com. Firing contagion isn't unprecedented. As Aki Ito wrote for Business Insider, Meta's 11,000 job cuts in late 2022 kicked off a firing spree across Silicon Valley and Corporate America, eventually affecting more than 250,000 people. However, the economists we spoke to weren't too worried yet. Guy Berger of Guild told Business Insider that these layoff waves over the past few years feel like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." He said it would take a lot of company layoffs "to move the meter." "These mass layoff announcements have not been representative of what most companies in the United States are doing; they're outliers that get a lot of attention," Berger said, adding, "maybe finally other firms start following their footstep, but so far it has not happened." Even if hiring stays frozen, it would take a lot of Amazon-sized events to really set off alarm bells: During the Great Recession, for example, layoffs were regularly over 2 million a month — 300,000 more than this year's monthly average. That works out to around 20 Amazon layoff announcements' worth of cuts a month to make things really scary. Ernie Tedeschi of Yale's Budget Lab said it would take a bit more. "Layoffs in good labor markets still often flirt with 2 million (especially now that our population is larger)," he wrote in an email to Business Insider. "But the one time we broke 2.5 million was the legit scary months of early 2009." As Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said, the tech sector's churn doesn't reflect the full job market. "C-suites are much more strategic than that, and they're not going to just start doing something because other firms are doing it without a reason," Peterson said. "We need to remember that there are still several industries that are suffering from labor shortages." These industries, like healthcare, will continue to need to staff up, especially as more people retire. Claudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, said layoff announcements can at least give the direction, but not the magnitude, of what's happening in the job market. "Layoff announcements, first and foremost, are about the companies," Sahm said. "They're business decisions. And so Amazon's a very large company, but it is not the US labor market."

Title: The Flaw in Trump’s MAGA Media Empire Plot

One of the things you used to hear conservatives say a lot is that they don’t want the government to “pick winners and losers.” That sentiment has been muted for the past nine months, because such choices have become the prime directive of the Trump administration. From taking stakes in companies, to dictating what kind of energy can get permitted, to going to bat for Big Tech in international trade deals, Trump has treated the U.S. economy like a personal plaything, and corporate success increasingly depends on proximity to the king. He didn’t raise $350 million for that White House ballroom because corporations think state dinner event spaces are a worthwhile investment. More from David Dayen Last week, a rumor emerged revealing another example of Trump stage-managing the business world. Warner Bros. Discovery—which owns a movie studio, numerous cable networks (CNN, Discovery, TBS, TNT, HGTV, Cartoon Network, TCM), the pay-TV channel HBO, streaming service HBO Max, DC Comics, part of The CW network, part of Fandango, several gaming studios, some theme park in Madrid, and much more—has publicly announced that it is for sale. Several companies, including Comcast, Netflix, and Amazon, are sniffing around a purchase, but the one that’s clearly amped to acquire WBD is Paramount, fresh off of being acquired itself by David Ellison’s Skydance Media. Paramount has made three unsolicited offers for WBD, none of which were accepted. WBD CEO David Zaslav opening up the company for public bidding robs Paramount of its head start. One way Ellison can close the deal, then, is to pick up the phone and call his friends in the Trump administration to force the issue. But there’s a problem with Trump’s grand plan to remake the media landscape: He’s not the only one who gets to make the decision. Related: This proposed media empire runs on AI Here’s the Trump administration’s plan. According to the New York Post’s Charlie Gasparino, the White House would give preferential treatment to Paramount in any sale by making it harder for any other suitor to buy WBD. “Who owns Warner Bros. Discovery is very important to the administration … The Warner board needs to think very seriously not just on the price competition but which player in the suitor pool has been successful getting a deal done. And that points to the Ellisons,” a senior administration official told Gasparino. To reinforce this, Makan Delrahim, Trump’s head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division in the first term, has been hired by Paramount to ensure strong administration ties. Vowing, even in private, to block Comcast or Netflix or Amazon from buying WBD, but wave through Paramount, is illegal (if that matters anymore). There are nakedly ideological reasons behind this: The Ellison family is a longtime Trump ally; CBS News is being remade in Bari Weiss’s image; Comcast and Netflix at least have angered the president with Saturday Night Live parodies or perceived wokeness; and these grievances are driving the discretionary application of law. Trump pays more attention to media mergers than other business combinations, as befits his obsession with how he is portrayed to the public. The Ellisons, who already have their hands on TikTok, would add CNN to CBS News, building out a right-leaning rival to Fox in old and new media. Doing so through a shotgun wedding with implicit (if not explicit) approvals is just deeply corrupt. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In a normal environment, these proposed mergers for WBD would violate antitrust law. Dropping from five major studios to four would substantially lessen competition for producers and writers and actors. Combining the fourth- and fifth-largest streaming services, as a WBD-Paramount tie-up would, or number one and number four in the case of Netflix, robs consumers of choice in a market where price hikes are a routine occurrence. And Paramount has already cut 1,000 jobs after its Skydance merger: Mass layoffs would surely be the result of any WBD acquisition. Fewer options, added costs, and a strangling of the information needed in a democracy would be just some of the results. Under the Clayton Act and their interpretation in new merger guidelines written in 2023 by President Biden’s antitrust enforcers, a merger between Paramount and WBD would trigger several structural presumptions of illegality, with respect to both movie studios (the combined company would have more than 30 percent of the market) and televised news. Those 2023 merger guidelines are still in place, and importantly, state attorneys general can use them and the relevant federal laws to block the merger. Any state receiving programming from WBD or Paramount—in other words, every state—would have jurisdiction to sue. There’s nothing stopping the attorney general of Minnesota or Washington or California from saying right now that, based on their reading of the law and the known market shares of the relevant parties, a WBD-Paramount merger would be illegal and they would seek an injunction if it proceeds. If Trump is signaling in one direction, AGs could signal in another. Maybe state enforcers won’t want to prejudge the case, but others have already stepped forward. The Writers Guild of America, whose members are on the front lines of this potential sale, called a WBD tie-up with Paramount or any other studio or streaming service “a disaster for writers, for consumers, and for competition” and said their members would “work with regulators to block the merger.” I doubt that they’re referring to the Trump administration. In the absence of a strong stand from state regulators, Trump and Ellison will likely get what they want. There certainly isn’t any fight left in the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, which just approved a merger between Disney and Fubo, putting another outlet under control of the sports media empire that owns ESPN. Fubo had blocked Disney’s aborted attempt to bundle sports into one service called Venu, so Disney responded by simply buying its opponent. Despite an investigation, the Antitrust Division waved it through. Gail Slater’s division hasn’t brought a single new merger or monopolization case to trial this year. Its most notorious merger challenge, between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks, was aborted in a settlement organized by MAGA lobbyists, which are becoming more dominant as directors of government policy. Cowed by lobbyist anger, the Antitrust Division has subordinated itself into nothing more than an advisory panel for big business. Yet the drafters of our antitrust laws considered the possibility that the federal government would get too cozy with corporate titans by allowing states into the process. In its bid to squash a judicial proceeding that could blow open the corruption hanging over competition policy, Slater’s Antitrust Division concedes that states can bring their own actions to block mergers anytime they want. They ought to take her up on it preemptively in the WBD-Paramount case.

Title: Tens of thousands of layoffs are being blamed on AI. Experts say there may be more to the story.

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Some of the largest companies in America have begun capping or reducing their head counts, blaming the promise of productivity with artificial intelligence for their decisions. Yet, so far, there is uneven evidence that the promised cost-savings from AI are actually worth what companies are putting into it. This leaves some experts questioning whether AI could be serving as a fig leaf for companies that are laying off employees for old-fashioned reasons, such as financial underperformance or global economic uncertainty. “It’s much easier for a company to say, ‘We are laying workers off because we’re realizing AI-related efficiencies’ than to say ‘We’re laying people off because we’re not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,’” David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in an email to NBC News. “Whether or not AI were the reason, you’d be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI,” wrote Autor, an expert on AI’s impact on workers. This week, Amazon announced it had begun a reorganization that would result in the elimination of 14,000 roles — and said AI was a leading cause. “The world is changing quickly,” Amazon Senior Vice President Beth Galetti wrote Tuesday. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Yet a few hours later, a different Amazon representative tried to downplay the role that AI played in the layoff decisions. “AI is not the reason behind the vast majority of reductions,” said the representative, who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to give her name. “Last year, we set out to strengthen our culture and teams by reducing layers,” among other measures, she said. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work.” The representative declined to comment on the apparent mismatch between this second statement about AI and Amazon’s earlier comments. But that disparity — coming from a company as large and disciplined as Amazon — highlights how difficult it can be for the public to verify what companies say about AI and its role in personnel decisions. Amazon joins plenty of other companies in justifying recent job cuts by pointing to AI. Walmart recently signaled that it intends to keep headcount flat over the next several years, largely as a result of AI. Goldman Sachs announced a fresh round of layoffs this month, saying it planned to reduce human roles that AI could potentially perform. Salesforce recently reduced its workforce by 4,000, citing “the benefits and efficiencies” of AI. One might think that these companies were all seeing huge benefits from AI, the kind of returns that would make these difficult — and expensive — layoffs worthwhile. Indeed, the number of companies that report being focused on AI’s return on investment has surged in recent months, according to data from AlphaSense, an AI research firm. So where, exactly, are all these benefits? That’s where it gets tricky. Recent studies have found significant limits on the productivity of AI, at least in its current manifestation. Out of 1,250 firms surveyed by Boston Consulting Group for a September report, 60% said they had seen “minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment” in AI. Only 10% of the organizations involved in a similar Deloitte survey said they were getting “significant return on investment from agentic AI," or systems that can make decisions beyond simply following prompts. Nonetheless, more large American companies than ever are using, investing in and measuring the business impact of generative AI, according to a new report from UPenn’s Wharton School and GBK Collective. But like the other surveys, the Wharton report shows mixed results. “It’s great if you can shave 20 minutes off an email or half an hour reading a report. But that’s not going to leapfrog anything,” said Stefano Puntoni, faculty co-director of Human-AI Research at Wharton and an author of the study. Many of the same companies that are making layoff announcements while touting AI investments have also been under increased financial pressure. Amazon’s layoffs announcement comes ahead of its third quarter earnings results, set to be released Thursday. While analysts expect improvement, there is growing concern about increased competition for Amazon’s AWS cloud platform from AI. After hitting an all-time high in January, shares of Amazon have been largely flat this year and are about 6% below that record. Meanwhile, Salesforce shares are down about 29% from a December 2024 high. Some analysts have questioned whether implementing more AI will be enough to stave off the threat posed by AI to Salesforce’s core product lineup. “No matter what the current state of the company, the narrative is negative and just about impossible to disprove,” wrote Jackson Ader, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital financial group. Some of the companies enacting job cuts are simply looking to rein in spending — including firms at the core of the AI boom. Last week, Facebook-parent Meta announced it was cutting 600 roles in its AI unit over concerns that it had become “bloated.” Rival Microsoft has announced three separate rounds of layoffs this year, and says it is looking to cut costs elsewhere in the company in order to pay for its massive AI investments. Yet even firms far from Silicon Valley are getting swept up. UPS said Tuesday it had eliminated 34,000 roles from its operational division, which includes drivers and package handlers — a 70% increase from its previous target. UPS also plans to reduce its reliance on seasonal hires and significantly cut back on vehicle leases. These changes are “powered by automation,” the company said — corporate shorthand for AI. UPS is “freeing up our network to grow in the best parts of the market,” a spokesperson said. “AI and robotics help to make jobs safer, while also reducing repetitive tasks.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.

A clip shared by New York-based Amazon engineer, Abir Bhattacharjee, detailing how he came to know about the company's massive layoffs has gone viral. In the clip on social media, Abir is seen speaking with another person, casually sharing the moment he realised what was coming. “I had lunch at 4 p.m. I knew this was layoff week. Everyone knew,” he said in the Instagram video shared on Monday evening. Abir explained that he was deploying a big update to production, which was related to the customer-facing stage. After a quick lunch, he returned to his desk when his coworker asked him if he had “seen it”. “I thought production had broken,” Abir said. But his coworker looked worried for another reason. That’s when Abir learned that Amazon was planning to lay off 30,000 employees. “That’s how I knew it was happening tomorrow,” the tech influencer, who has nearly 40,000 followers on Instagram, said. His video has garnered more than 50,000 likes so far. Following this, the other person in the video mentions the company is also planning to lay off 6,00,000 factory workers in 2028. He then suggests Abir could join the factory floor then. A post shared by Abir Bhattacharjee (@abirbhattacharjee___) To this, Abir retorts in a light-hearted vein: “I'm too polished now. I like sitting at my pretty desk. I can't live a hard life.” He then follows up with a question, wondering what his next move would be if he got laid off. The other person then jokingly says: “Startup”. Concluding the video, Abir speaks on a more serious note that he will certainly need a plan B the next morning, referring to the potential layoffs in the next few hours. It is to be noted that NDTV Profit has not independently verified Abir's employment with Amazon. On Tuesday, Amazon announced job cuts for 14,000 workers, marking the first phase of its bold plan to eliminate 30,000 roles. The layoffs mark the latest move by the tech giant to slash costs and preserve cash amid a slowing economy. Sources said the reductions, which may roll out over several weeks, will impact roughly 10% of Amazon’s corporate workforce. Many employees reported receiving a text message from the company on Tuesday morning, which confirmed they had been laid off. The incident has sparked a broader debate about modern employment and the increasing impact of artificial intelligence on the job market.

Title: Amazon's cloud boss says the company feels 'quite good' about its massive AI bets

Every time Lee Chong Ming publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is pouring billions into AI infrastructure, and its cloud boss says the company is confident its bets will pay off. The Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said in an interview with CNBC Television published Wednesday that the company feels "quite good" about its massive AI investments, despite rising fears that the AI boom could become a bubble. "Others may have maybe more speculative investments," Garman said in the interview recorded on October 17. "We're very intentional about how we think about leveraging risk and thinking about how we have the long-term view of what this business looks like." Garman's remarks come as Amazon announced the activation of Project Rainier, its $11 billion AI data center in rural Indiana. The announcement coincides with one of the company's biggest ever rounds of layoffs. Project Rainier, one of the largest AI data centers in the world, is dedicated to training and running models from Anthropic, one of Amazon's key AI partners and a rival to OpenAI. More than 500,000 AWS Tranium 2 chips have already been deployed at the data center, which is fully operational and scheduled to double in scale by year-end, Garman said. Garman told CNBC that AWS has spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures over the past year building infrastructure. Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs to make it leaner as AI enables companies to "innovate much faster." Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, said in a blog post that Amazon needs to have fewer management layers to move faster. The company is shifting resources to invest in its biggest bets, reducing in some areas and hiring in others, Galetti added. Amazon has 1.55 million employees globally. The cuts represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees. AWS did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Amazon's latest layoffs are a continuation of the company's yearslong effort to slim down and refocus. In recent years, the company has trimmed management layers, tightened costs, and overhauled pay and performance systems. Amazon announced last September that most corporate staff would have to return to the office five days a week. When growth slowed after the pandemic, Amazon started cutting unprofitable projects and a bloated workforce. CEO Andy Jassy said in a June memo that AI-driven efficiency gains would further shrink head count. Earlier this year, Amazon froze hiring in its retail division, and in July, AWS also saw layoffs. It's not just Amazon cutting thousands of jobs this year. Microsoft announced plans in July to cut about 15,000 roles this year to focus on "security, quality, and AI transformation," while Meta said last week it is cutting roles in its risk organization and replacing them with automation technology.

Title: Executives Don’t See AI Undercutting Jobs Yet

ByJoe McKendrick, Senior Contributor. AI a job killer? While AI gets partially the blame for headline-grabbing layoffs such as Amazon shedding 14,000 employees, it’s notable that more than five million people still get hired monthly within the United States. The latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the hiring rate at 5,126,000 for the month of August. Less than two in 10 executives, at most, foresee job cuts as a result of AI in their own organizations, according to the authors of a new study of 800 business leaders out of University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and GBK Collective. If anything, 40% expect AI to help boost hiring of entry-level jobs, while another 40% say their hiring patterns will not change. Only 18% foresee AI decreasing entry-level job opportunities. Likewise, 33% of executives expect AI to increase hiring of executives, and another 54% expect no effect on the sizes of their executive staffs. This is the third year for this particular study, conducted by Wharton’s Human-AI Research (WHAIR) center. Some parts of the business will see the greater impact from AI than others. IT departments lead the pack, with 47% affected by AI, up from 30% in the 2023 survey. Purchasing and procurement comes in at 39%, up from 14% just two years ago. At least 37% of product development and engineering departments will be reshaped by AI, up from 22% in the 2023 survey. When it comes to measuring relative success rates with generative AI, the Wharton study paints a generally positive picture. A few weeks back, a lot of eyebrows were being raised about MIT researchers’ estimates that only five percent of generative AI projects are showing tangible results in businesses. The current Wharton study, on the other hand, finds at least three in four enterprises, 74%, are already seeing positive returns on their genAI investments, the Wharton survey finds. These results are based on solid ROI metrics such as productivity, profitability and throughput. The successes with AI were self-reported in the Wharton/GBK study, as the co-authors note that they “intentionally asked the question about ROI for gen AI in a fairly broad way to allow leaders to essentially answer according to their own definition.” Are executives compelled to portray a rosier picture of their efforts? Who knows, right? Perhaps there is greater comfort with AI. Close to half of these executives, 46%, now use gen AI on a daily basis in their work. A majority, 82%, use it weekly. On average, 82% business leaders expect their AI investments to pay off in just two to three years. With the technology evolving almost every day, the greatest inhibitor is “skill atrophy” — meaning it takes talent and training, not just technology, to fully succeed with AI. Decision-makers see gen AI as a supplement to human capital (89% agree), more than a replacement (71% agree). Still, 43% agree that gen AI will lead to declines in proficiency. The higher you go up the corporate hierarchy, the more optimism you find pertaining to gen AI. Leaders at the vice-president level and above are much more optimistic about early ROI for their gen AI investments compared to mid-managers, with 45% reporting significantly positive returns (defined as greater than 20% ROI) versus only 27% of mid-managers. Mid-managers, the survey shows, are more cautious, and are twice as likely to say it is “too early to tell/still in pilot phase” (16% versus 8% of senior leaders).

GM layoffs: General Motors (GM) announced on Wednesday plans to cut US electric vehicle and battery production. It will lay off 1,200 workers at its Detroit EV plant and 550 at a battery plant in Ohio, as a response to a slowdown in battery car demand, Reuters reported. In January, the automaker said it would pause battery cell production at two US joint-venture battery plants in Tennessee and Ohio for nearly six months. Meanwhile, GM will temporarily lay off 5,500 employees across three plants. This includes 3,400 workers furloughed at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where the electric Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Hummer EVs are produced. The company stated on Wednesday that it will evaluate the required level of production and reinstate approximately 2,200 of those employees in January when the plant resumes operations on a single shift. The remaining 1,200 will be furloughed indefinitely, Bloomberg reported. The layoffs come as several companies announce job cuts. E-commerce giant Amazon recently confirmed it will slash 14,000 jobs across departments amid its push for artificial intelligence (AI). From January, GM will reduce production at its Detroit EV plant to one shift, down from the current two, following previous layoffs at the facility. This change will decrease output by roughly 50%. The plant manufactures three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, along with the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV. General Motors said the production and job cuts were “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.” Last month, it lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements, the report said. US automakers are significantly reducing their EV plans, expecting a rapid decline in consumer demand once the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires. Experts say that EV sales could potentially drop by 50% in the upcoming months after surpassing 10% of total US car sales this summer, the report said. Nissan, Jeep-maker Stellantis, and other automakers have halted plans for upcoming electric models. Earlier in October, GM announced it was cancelling the production of its Brightdrop electric van, citing slow progress in the commercial EV van market. GM has revised its outlook for EV sales downward and implemented additional EV production cuts this year. United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain criticised GM for the job cuts, highlighting that the company increased its expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. "The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond," the report quoted Fain. The company said it cut around 500 white-collar jobs in the last week. In 2021, GM announced plans to shift to all EV sales by 2035 and increased investment, but it has since scaled back its efforts amid dwindling demand. Last week, GM CEO Mary Barra said, "With an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it's clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned." She also hoped that the automaker would reduce EV losses from 2026 onwards. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With AI rolling out across industries, one question has loomed: will people lose their jobs? Amazon kick-started an answer this week. On Tuesday, the Jeff Bezos-owned tech giant cut 14,000 workers across its corporate workforce. Amazon said the deep cuts were the latest in CEO Andy Jassey's plan to have the firm act "like the world's largest startup." Business Insider's tech team used internal documents to reveal how Amazon's top brass shared the news, what they told workers who were laid off, and their advice for the staff who remained. But all eyes are now on what comes next — not just for Amazon but companies beyond Silicon Valley as artificial intelligence rattles a frozen job market. Is AI behind Amazon's decision to lay off 14,000 employees, and will more companies follow suit with layoffs of their own? Business Insider's Chief Tech Correspondent Eugene Kim and Chief Correspondent Aki Ito joined Deputy Executive Editor Dan DeFrancesco to discuss. Kim broke news about the divisions of Amazon hit hardest by the layoffs, while Ito's latest piece explored how Amazon's full-throttle approach to layoffs could be a warning sign of more AI-related job cuts.
