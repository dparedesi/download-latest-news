Konstantinos Sinanas, an acoustic and computer systems engineer who has worked for some of the largest tech companies in America—including Amazon, HP, Harman-Samsung, Synaptics, MeyerSound, and Crestron—is the Greek engineer who participated in the Artemis I – Callisto space program. The project was carried out in collaboration with NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon, and he succeeded in realizing Jeff Bezos’s vision: enabling crews to give voice commands to Alexa and have them executed by the spacecraft‘s systems. “Many people tell me this project is an experience I’ll be able to share for the rest of my life. Science fiction became reality,” says the Greek Distinguished Technologist Konstantinos Sinanas in an interview with the Athens News Agency (APE), explaining that, “In the Artemis I – Callisto space program (a collaboration between NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon), I was the Acoustic Design Lead for integrating Alexa into the Orion spacecraft. The project began during the pandemic, and there had been several failed attempts by other colleagues and teams before I took over. The pressure was immense—there was no room for failure, as it would affect not only me but also the future of Alexa, Amazon, Jeff Bezos personally, Lockheed, NASA, and the reputation of the United States in general.” There is no room for mistakes in space “In anything related to space, mistakes are not an option. Once the launch happens, you need to be 100% sure the systems will work. If there’s a problem, you can’t just ‘go and fix it.’ That’s why, beyond exhaustive system simulations, I insisted on on-site tests at the Orion mockup in Houston. Even though that caused a lot of friction and difficulties, I was certain it was the only way to succeed—and in the end, we did,” Mr. Sinanas emphasizes. Speaking about the field he has served for decades, he explained that he works on the research and development of microphones and micro-speakers—whether embedded in devices or as peripherals (wired/wireless headsets, speakers, microphones, etc.)—covering both consumer and professional audio products, including mobile phones, laptops, and smart devices. At the same time, he designs and equips audio labs and studios and conducts acoustic studies for spaces and installations. 15 Years in America’s Leading Tech Companies “In recent years, Konstantinos Sinanas worked at HP as a Distinguished Technologist at the R&D center, focusing on audio hardware and software, acoustics, innovation, and artificial intelligence. In addition to his main responsibilities, I also had the role of ambassador for international standards and specifications, mentor, and HP representative in global technology forums,” he notes. He explains that over the 15 years he worked in the U.S., he collaborated closely with companies such as “Microsoft, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Cirrus Logic, Qualcomm, Realtek, Dolby, DTS, Waves, and other HW/SW suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia to create new HP technologies, applications, and products. This gave me the opportunity to work with the entire group of tech giants in Silicon Valley and to gain knowledge and connections I never imagined possible—even though I already had experience with major projects through Harman, with companies such as Google, Apple, JBL, AKG, Huawei, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, Oculus, Bloomberg, LG, and many others.” The Financial Crisis Pushed Him to America “Although I had a successful career in Greece as an educator and engineer, since 2007 I had started to see that the future of the country—especially for those who wanted to grow professionally and financially—was looking bleak. After much thought, sacrifices, and taking a big risk, I made the decision to move to the U.S. in 2010, along with my wife. We have lived in Astoria (New York), Edgewater with Crestron, Los Angeles with Harman-Samsung, Irvine, Orange County with Synaptics, Berkeley with MeyerSound, Santa Clara with Amazon, and in Houston, Texas, with HP,” he notes. When asked whether there’s a secret to success, Konstantinos Sinanas replies, “There are many—not ‘secrets,’ but talents, capabilities, and skills one must possess to build a successful career. It takes a combination of talent, specialized knowledge, flexibility, and continuous development. From crafting the right resume and handling interviews, to managing relationships with colleagues, partners, and the company. Consistency, productivity, integrity, and effectiveness are essential to surviving in the competitive tech space—especially in the U.S.” The Tech Sector Is Facing a Crisis in the U.S. Commenting on the current state of the tech industry in the U.S., he clarified, “Over the past two or three years, the tech sector has been facing a crisis due to poor policy and corporate strategic decisions. This has led to mass layoffs, downsizing, or closure of companies, with serious social consequences. Unfortunately, the reforms now being implemented should have happened a decade ago. Although they may seem strict or confusing to many, they are necessary to avoid worse outcomes for the future of the U.S.” What Comes Next? A Return to Greece As for his future plans? Konstantinos Sinanas answers spontaneously, without a second thought:“My goal is to return permanently to Greece and offer everything I gained abroad—knowledge, experience, innovation, and connections—into education, production, and research. Important efforts are being made, but I believe we still have a long way to go for our country to move forward. I hope that my wife and I will succeed in settling permanently in our homeland.” Explore related questions

Title: Big Tech cozied up to Trump — it’s not getting much in return

The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. by Alex Heath For a while, it looked like President Donald Trump was going to have Big Tech’s back. Now, the tech industry is collateral damage in his global trade war. On Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated the idea of placing “a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services” if tariff negotiations with the US go south. This would be the opposite outcome that tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg were hoping for when they threw their support behind the new administration. To someone like Zuckerberg, Trump was supposed to be the strong-armed leader to bring the overbearing EU to heel. Instead, the rhetoric between the US and EU is ratcheting up just weeks before the EU is already set to fine Meta (and Apple) for violating its Digital Markets Act. While certainly more of a self-inflicted wound, Elon Musk’s popularity in the US has “inverted as his support for President Trump has increased,” Nate Silver wrote this week. Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile. has lost over a third of its value this year, and, thanks to tariffs, the company has removed the option to buy new, US-made vehicles in China. As I predicted last week, TikTok is particularly screwed by Trump’s extra-aggressive China tariffs, which the country has promised to “fight to the end.” Even as it’s still business as usual for TikTok’s rank and file, the app’s fate in the US feels increasingly precarious. When asked this week about the extended deadline to reach a TikTok deal in the US, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry said the government “opposes practices that ignore the laws of the market economy, plunder by force, and damage the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.” “There’s not going to be much dialogue until that’s resolved,” one of TikTok’s aspiring bidders, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi, said this week of the tariffs. The situation is such a mess that the US stock market tanking also “drowned out the ability to infer feedback” from shareholders about AppLovin’s bid, Foroughi told Bloomberg. If anything, this week is a reminder that the tech industry has grown so large and influential that its leading companies are tools for leverage between countries. In times of relative peace, that influence can be beneficial for Big Tech. When things get hostile, Big Tech is put in the crosshairs.

Google reportedly laid off hundreds of employees from its Platforms and Devices division. The details come from The Information (via Engadget), which notes that Google said it would lay off employees earlier this year. The search giant offered buyouts in January as part of a “voluntary exit plan.” The Platforms and Devices division employs over 25,000 people. It handles Google’s Pixel devices, Nest products, and software like Android, ChromeOS, and Chrome. The division was formed roughly one year ago when Google merged its Platforms and Ecosystems unit and Devices and Services under senior vice president Rick Osterloh. A Google spokesperson told The Information that after combining the units last year, the company “focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively,” which included job reductions and the voluntary exit program. Google isn’t the only tech company laying off employees. Per data gathered by tech-focused job board TrueUp, tech companies have laid off over 45,000 people so far this year and nearly 240,000 employees in 2024. So far this year, we’ve seen layoffs from Microsoft, HP, Block, Meta, Amazon (which impacted workers in Quebec), and more. Source: The Information Via: Engadget

Title: What's Wrong With APPLE?

Time Published: 2025-04-11T11:52:37Z

Even before President Trump’s tariffs threatened to upend Apple’s manufacturing business in China, the company’s struggle to make new products was leading some people inside its lavish Silicon Valley headquarters to wonder whether the company had somehow lost its magic. The tariffs, which were introduced April 2, caused Apple to lose $773 billion in market capitalization in four days and briefly lose its standing as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But investors had already started to sour on the company, sending its share price down 8 percent in the first four months of the year, double the S&P 500’s decline. Apple had hoped to revive its fortunes over the past year with a virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, and an artificial intelligence system called Apple Intelligence. Sales of the headset have been a disappointment, however, and the signature features of the A.I. system have been postponed because it didn’t work as well as the company had expected. The company’s issues underscored how its reputation for innovation, once considered a fundamental element of its brand, has become an albatross, fueling angst among employees and frustration among customers. And company insiders worry that Apple, despite its years of gravity-defying profits, is hamstrung by the political infighting, penny pinching and talent drain that often bedevil large companies, according to more than a dozen former and current employees and advisers. Apple declined to comment. It has been a decade since the releases of Apple’s most recent commercial successes: the Apple Watch and AirPods. Its services like Apple TV+ and Fitness+, which it introduced in 2019, lag behind rivals in subscriptions. Half of its sales still come from the iPhone, an 18-year-old product that is incrementally improved nearly every year. While Vision Pro sales have been disappointing, Apple’s issues with Apple Intelligence exposed dysfunction inside the organization. In a nearly two-hour video presentation last summer, Apple demonstrated how the A.I. product would summarize notifications and offer writing tools to improve emails and messages. It also revealed an improved Siri virtual assistant that could combine information on a phone, like a message about someone’s travel itinerary, with information on the web, like a flight arrival time. The A.I. features were unavailable when new iPhones shipped. They arrived in October, about a month late, and quickly ran into trouble. Notification summaries misrepresented news reports, leading Apple to disable that feature. Then, last month, the company postponed the spring release of an improved Siri because internal testing found that it was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests, said three people familiar with the project who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After the delay, Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, told employees that the company would reshuffle its executives, removing responsibility for developing the new Siri from John Giannandrea, the company’s head of A.I., and giving it to Mike Rockwell, the head of its Vision Pro headset. “Apple needs to understand what happened because this is bigger than just rearranging the deck chairs,” said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst who previously worked as a product marketer at Apple. “If ever there’s been an example of over-promising and under-delivering, it’s Apple Intelligence.” It was the first time in years that Apple hadn’t shipped a product it had unveiled. Some details of Apple’s changes to its Siri team and challenges were previously reported by Bloomberg and The Information. The A.I. stumble was set in motion in early 2023. Mr. Giannandrea, who was overseeing the effort, sought approval from the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to buy more A.I. chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, five people with knowledge of the request said. The chips, which can perform hundreds of computations at the same time, are critical to building the neural networks of A.I. systems, like chatbots, that can answer questions or write software code. At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old — far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said. Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team’s chip budget, but Apple’s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient. The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development. At the same time, leaders at two of Apple’s software teams were battling over who would spearhead the rollout of Siri’s new abilities, three people who worked on the effort said. Robby Walker, who oversaw Siri, and Sebastien Marineau-Mes, a senior executive with the software team, struggled over who would have responsibility for some aspects of the project. Both ended up with pieces of the project. The infighting followed a broader exodus of talent from Apple. In 2019, Jony Ive, the company’s chief designer, left to start his own design firm and poached more than a dozen integral Apple designers and engineers. And Dan Riccio, the company’s longtime head of product design who worked on the Apple Watch, retired last year. In their place, Apple has been left with old and new leaders with less product development experience. Mr. Giannandrea, who joined the company in 2019 from Google, had never led the launch of a high-profile product like the improved Siri. And Mr. Federighi, his counterpart overseeing software, had never led the creation of a new operating system like some of his predecessors in that role. Mr. Cook, 64, who has a background in operations, has been hesitant over the years to provide clear and direct guidance on product development, said three people familiar with the way the company operates. “It’s clearly a breakdown of leadership and communication and internal processes,” said Benedict Evans, an independent analyst who previously worked as a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz. Apple hasn’t canceled its revamped Siri. The company plans to release a virtual assistant in the fall capable of doing things like editing and sending a photo to a friend on request, three people with knowledge of its plans said. Some of Apple’s leaders don’t think the delay is a problem because none of Apple’s rivals, like Google and Meta, have figured out A.I. yet, these people said. They believe there’s time to get it right. As the clock ticks on fixing Siri, Apple will be defending the assistant’s current shortcomings. Last month, customers filed a federal lawsuit accusing Apple of false advertising. Since then, its commercials about Siri have gone dark. Brian X. Chen contributed reporting. Tripp Mickle reports on Apple and Silicon Valley for The Times and is based in San Francisco. His focus on Apple includes product launches, manufacturing issues and political challenges. He also writes about trends across the tech industry, including layoffs, generative A.I. and robot taxis. The post What’s Wrong With Apple? appeared first on New York Times. Copyright © 2023.

President Donald Trump claimed a big win this past Wednesday when he convinced some 75 countries to negotiate on trade and tariffs, leaving China out in the cold. In doing so, he also avoided a bond market disaster. But we are not be out of the woods yet. Thousands of American businesses, and potentially millions of employees, are still on the front lines of the trade war with China — a war that took many by surprise. The risks of that confrontation threaten the entire U.S. economy. That is not to minimize what the Trump administration achieved this week, after the president took on all comers in a global trade confrontation, like Bruce Lee in a kung fu movie. In doing so, Trump goaded China into taking a hard line that cut it off, not just from U.S. markets but, potentially, from an entire American trading bloc. Whether Trump had gamed out every exact move, or simply found a path by applying constant pressure, it worked. China has been a disruptive player in global markets ever since it was admitted to the World Trade Organization 25 years ago, without having reformed its internal politics since the horrors of Tiananmen Square. But the U.S. and others believed that trade would make China’s political system more democratic, as it made China’s economy more free. And American companies wanted access to the vast Chinese market, and China’s labor force. At first, trade between China and the rest of the world was mutually beneficial. Many U.S. firms set up production facilities in China, while Hollywood found a large new audience for its cultural products. American consumers benefited from lower prices, and China’s middle class began to flourish. But then China started outcompeting its trading parters. Around the world, for example, textile factories began shutting down, unable to match low Chinese labor costs. China also stole the intellectual property of western firms. It insisted that they share their knowledge as a condition of doing business in the country — then set up Chinese firms that outcompeted the foreign ones. China also kept labor costs artificially low, in some industries, by using exploitative labor practices — or, in the case of the Uighur Muslims, slave labor. Some U.S. companies began pulling out of China; others saw no real alternative to operating there. Meanwhile, China held a growing amount of American public debt, giving it leverage over the U.S. Instead of China becoming more like America, the U.S. became more like China. Movie studios shaped their content to avoid offending Chinese audiences. Social media companies began helping the government censor its critics. And during the coronavirus pandemic — which began in China — U.S. authorities shut down the economy; some shut own basic rghts. The Wall Street Journal’s William Galston, the paper’s only left-of-center columnist, observed that much of the anxiety over globalization was not a function of trade itself but of the unique challenge that China posed. Conventional economic rules did not seem to apply to a trading partner that had the power to distort markets on its own. Admitted into a “free trade” system, China has tried to manipulate the rules to dominate trade for its own enrichment and power. Trump is the first president to have perceived that China is both a partner and a rival, perhaps even an enemy. He launched, and won, a trade war with China in his first term, and began a process of “decoupling” from China, especially after the coronavirus. That process might have continued, had Trump not lost to Joe Biden in 2020 — a president with corrupt business ties to China, through his son, Hunter — a story the media worked hard to suppress when it emerged. Trump has returned — four years, and trillions of dollars in American public debt, later — and he has adopted a more aggressive strategy to counter China. That includes controlling key points on global trade routes — Greenland, the Panama canal, Gaza (near the Suez Canal), the Cape of Good Hope — and launching the ongoing trade war, which has led China to retaliate, even as other U.S. trading partners sought opportunities for negotiation and compromise. We will have to wait for the history books and the insider accounts to learn how much of the last week was clever calculation, and how much was blunder and luck. But it seems likely that Trump’s ultimate goal was, consciously, to divide the world into trading blocs and ask our trading partners to make a choice: either the authoritarian, communist regime of China; or the democratic, free market system of the United States, flawed and messy though it may be. That strategy is well on its way. But it has also left thousands of American entrepreneurs, and potentially millions of workers, in the lurch. Giant companies like Apple can move production from China to India. For anything smaller, the tariffs are absolutely devastating — whether little mom-and-pop stores selling imported goods, small manufacturers using Chinese components in American factories, or gutsy inventors looking to scale up production beyond their garages. I spoke to an old friend from my Chicago days, Rick Woldenberg, this week. His toy company, Learning Resources, makes educational products that you may recognize from your childhood or your children’s schools. When the China tariffs, and counter-tariffs, hit this week, he was forced to pause production and shipping throughout his entire U.S.-China operation. His tax bill went up 50 times — yes, five-zero — from $2.3 million to $100.2 million, overnight. At a 20% tariff, Rick says, American companies like his got the message: move production out of China. At a 145% tariff, Rick says, the message is: “Die.” Rick’s company is a family business that has been around for a century. It employs 500 people, many in the Midwest. It had, until now, been in solid financial shape. Now, Rick told me, he faces going out of business. And he warned that if he faces that risk, then thousands of other companies doing business in China, who may have less flexibility than his, could be making similar choices. A “contagion effect” may be imminent: a cascade of layoffs and closures. With more than a hint of bitterness, he says he was doing fine before President Trump decided toe “fix” things. He understands the larger economic and strategic issues at stake, but his first responsibility is to his customers, his 500 employees, and his family legacy — a legacy of manufacturing, most of it in America. Rick has a suggestion: as long as we are pausing the implementation of tariffs on everyone else for 90 days, why not pause the tariffs for China as well? At least for long enough for his company to shift production, long enough to produce Christmas orders and put them on the water by July. Christmas, he notes, might be very cold indeed if the goods on which retailers depend fail to arrive in American ports. And we won’t be able to make them domestically yet. Perhaps this is all part of the plan — the anticipated cost of the trade war that may, in fact, have been inevitable, whether Trump decided to take a stand right now or leave the task to someone else. But if there is any way to mitigate that cost, it could provide Trump with the political cover he will need to fight this war to victory. A “Christmas truce” — extending the 90-day pause to tariffs on China, to fill Christmas orders — could be a timely, essential respite. Joel B.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy calls for startup culture in shareholder letter to drive innovation

Time Published: 2025-04-10T19:56:00Z

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently outlined his vision for the company in an annual letter to shareholders, blending startup-style agility with the scale of a global giant. He addressed challenges, including artificial intelligence investments and internal culture shifts, and stressed the need to innovate quickly and cut inefficiencies to remain competitive in fast-moving markets. Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, said he wants to run Amazon as if it were "the world's largest startup." The approach focuses on solving customer problems, encouraging invention, and giving employees ownership of their work. "Builders hate bureaucracy," Jassy wrote. "It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do." He revealed that in his time, Amazon had solicited employee feedback on bureaucratic hurdles and implemented over 375 changes based on nearly 1,000 responses. Jassy also detailed Amazon's artificial intelligence strategy, noting that a large share of this year's $100 billion in capital spending will go toward AI projects – especially within the Amazon Web Services division. Amazon's push to embed AI across customer-facing products and internal systems makes AWS crucial to its AI goals. Healthcare was another focal point in Jassy's letter. He highlighted Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical as key growth areas and pledged to "iterate quickly" to expand both services. Jassy's tenure has brought major cultural and structural shifts to Amazon. In addition to cost-cutting efforts that led to tens of thousands of layoffs, he has enforced a return-to-office policy for corporate employees, rolling back the remote work flexibility introduced during the pandemic. Jassy emphasized key principles for maintaining Amazon's innovative edge. Speed was a recurring theme. "Speed is a leadership decision," he wrote, stressing that companies can move quickly without sacrificing quality by removing structural barriers and streamlining decision-making processes. He emphasized scrappiness as a key trait of effective teams, referencing Amazon's early days when small teams with limited resources developed services like Simple Storage Service and Elastic Compute Cloud. Jassy believes that fear of failure often stifles creativity, arguing that bold bets driven by customer obsession are key to achieving extraordinary results. "You rarely, if ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everyone else," he wrote. Ultimately, Jassy stressed that delivering tangible customer value is Amazon's most important success metric. Charisma or internal politics, he noted, should never take precedence over results when it comes to rewards or recognition.

Amazon plans huge expansion of its logistics facilities When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon is reportedly planning to invest a staggering $15 billion across no less than 80 new logistics facilities across the US in a bid to better serve both cities and rural areas. A report from Bloomberg claims the company is planning to develop new delivery hubs, with some being large fulfillment centers equipped with state-of-the-art robots. Amazon is now inviting capital partners to submit proposals in what’s seen as welcome news amid ongoing tariff-induced economic uncertainty. When the world moved to remote and online habits during the pandemic, Amazon was believed to have overspent on retail infrastructure and staffing, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. Between November 2022 and March 2023, Amazon laid off around 27,000 workers. Although its ecommerce business continues to grow, recent investments have largely focused on cloud and AI technologies, so it’s reassuring to see that the online retail giant is hasn’t given up on what it’s known best for by consumers. Speaking about the company’s fourth-quarter and year-end results, Jassy noted Amazon had delivered its “fastest speeds ever” for Prime in 2024, with a 65% year-over-year increase in US orders delivered on the same day or overnight, thanks largely to its expansive network of logistics facilities and transportation resources. The company now has around 600 fulfillment centers in the US alone, but no timeline has been shared for the addition of another 80. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite a positive outlook, it’s clear that Amazon isn’t immune from the ongoing trade war, having reportedly canceled numerous orders from China and other Asian countries over tariffs. Amazon told us that the projects being discussed aren't finalized, but they are still ideas that are up for consideration. Steve Kelly, a spokesperson for Amazon, noted: "Meetings like this with our capital partners are routine and part of the normal due diligence process, as we consider potential, future projects." The company also confirmed some figures to us – Amazon supports nearly five million jobs across the US, having invested over $244 billion into the nation in 2023 alone.

Title: 'This Is Life or Death': American Mom-and-Pop Businesses Could Still Collapse as China Tariffs Climb; Want 90-Day Pause to 'Save Christmas'

Many small businesses are still threatened by the trade war facing the United States, even though President Donald Trump suspended most tariffs for 90 days. The escalating tariffs on China have halted imports — and manufacturing — for many American companies, including mom-and-pop stores and family-owned businesses that cannot easily shift production or sourcing to other countries. ‘This is life or death,” says Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, a century-old toy manufacturing company that makes educational materials for thousands of American schools. Woldenberg told Breitbart News that the Trump administration’s tariffs on China — which hit 145% as of Thursday morning — would cause his tax bill to rise from roughly $2 million to $100 million — overnight. To stay in business, Woldenberg estimated that he would have to raise his prices 40-45%. Otherwise, “[Trump] is killing me. I’m dead.” Woldenberg also estimates that he has 10,000 molds at a port in China, weighing approximately 7,000,000 pounds, and he has to find something to do with them if he cannot import them and face the steep tax that follows. Learning Resources, and other companies that source components from China, are being forced to halt production or block shipments from leaving port in China. The result could be factory closures cascading layoffs — not just in China, which is the target of Trump’s policy, but also in the U.S, meaning Wednesday’s stock-market joy could be short-lived. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday: “More container-shipping companies are cancelling sailings from Asia to the U.S. and Europe.” And other entrepreneurs are echoing Woldenberg’s fears of a massive impact on U.S. industry — precisely the opposite of the effect intended by Trump’s policy, which aims to protect and grow U.S. manufacturing. Woldenberg would like the administration to implement a 90-day pause on the China tariffs, just as it has done with other tariffs. “At least let us get the Christmas orders in,” he said, noting that 90 days would allow American firms to put goods afloat in time for the most important retail season of the year. “Otherwise, it’s going to be nuclear winter.” Joel B.

Title: More Microsoft job cuts could hit non-coding staff and middle managers

In brief: Microsoft is considering making more job cuts this year, adding to the performance-based layoffs and other terminations it has implemented in 2025 so far. The latest round could come as soon as May and will reportedly target managers and non-coding staff. Some Microsoft organizations are looking to increase their span of control, defined as the number of direct reports or subordinates a manager or supervisor oversees. It also wants to increase the number of coders compared to non-coders on projects, According to anonymous people familiar with the matter who spoke to Business Insider, Microsoft has yet to decide how many jobs will be cut, though one person said it could be a significant portion of their team. Other companies such as Amazon and Google are also reducing the number of managers and executives in their drive for efficiency. Microsoft wants to decrease the ratio of product/program managers (PMs) to engineers. Microsoft security boss Charlie Bell's division has a ratio of around 5.5 engineers to one PM, but he wants that to reach 10:1. News that Microsoft is targeting non-coders in these cuts is in contrast to the many stories about generative AI replacing the need for programmers. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott made the startling prediction last week that 95% of all code will be generated by AI by 2030. He added that humans would still be involved in the process, though it's easy to imagine that there will be fewer of them. At the start of the year, Microsoft confirmed it was implementing performance-based layoffs, though it said those let go would be replaced with new hires. Microsoft rates employees on a scale of 0 to 200 and bases their stock awards and bonuses on this rating. Anyone in the 60 to 80 range – 100 is average – is rated as a low performer. Soon after those performance cuts were revealed, the company said it was making more job cuts across its business, impacting employees in the gaming, experience & devices, sales, and security divisions. In other Microsoft news, the company this week terminated the employment of two engineers who protested against its AI-related contracts with the Israeli government.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Freeze: What Could Have Happened if They Stayed in Place?
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2025/trumps-tariff-freeze-what-could-have-happened-if-they-stayed-in-place/

Highlights Trump's temporary freeze on reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, provided short-term market relief, prompting a 2,200-point surge in the Dow Jones. Had tariffs remained, businesses such as Walmart, Target, PepsiCo and smaller retailers anticipated significant price increases and supply chain disruptions across groceries, clothing and electronics. Economists estimated that sustained tariffs could have raised consumer prices substantially, reduced annual GDP growth by approximately 0.6% and cost the economy between $80 billion and $110 billion per year. Hate to say you read it here first, but here’s a prescient quote left on the cutting room floor from PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster’s interview with QED Investors partner Amias Gerety just two days ago: “Because this is a self-inflicted economic wound, we get an extra dollop of uncertainty. Trump could reverse all of these tomorrow.” He waited until the day after tomorrow. On Wednesday (April 9) Trump announced a temporary suspension of reciprocal tariffs for most countries, reducing rates to a universal 10%. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were escalated to a staggering 125%, citing China’s “disrespect” toward global markets. This sharp increase followed China’s retaliatory tariffs earlier in the week, intensifying trade tensions between the two countries. The pause provided temporary relief to many industries and market, as seen in the Dow Jones surge by nearly 2,200 points. However, companies and economists remain cautious about its long-term implications. The freeze does not eliminate tariffs entirely, leaving uncertainty about future trade policies but also pulling the covers on what companies may do if the temporary freeze is lifted for an appreciable amount of time. Had the tariffs remained in place, companies across various sectors were poised to pass increased costs onto consumers. Grocery chains like Morton Williams anticipated price hikes of up to 20% on imported items such as olive oil and canned tuna due to tariff impacts. Retailers like Target had already adjusted their inventory strategies earlier in the year to mitigate immediate price shocks but warned of steep increases for perishable goods like fresh produce within weeks. Similarly, manufacturers reliant on imported components faced significant challenges. PepsiCo noted declining snack sales due to inflationary pressures even before the tariff announcements. If sustained, higher tariffs could have exacerbated these trends, forcing companies to shrink product sizes (shrinkflation) or reduce offerings altogether. For smaller businesses with limited capacity to absorb costs, the effects would have been even more pronounced. Independent grocery stores and smaller manufacturers often adjust prices faster than larger corporations due to lower inventory levels. These dynamics highlight how prolonged tariffs, if they return, could disproportionately impact smaller players in the market. A PYMNTS report released earlier this week showed “about half of SMBs rely on immediate sales or existing cash for survival, with business credit cards — which are not a working capital solution — being the most common form of financing for those with access,” PYMNTS wrote recently. ”SMBs with access to some method of financing demonstrate greater confidence in navigating economic challenges.” The challenges extend to middle-market companies where — per additional PYMNTS Intelligence research — 60% of CFOs expect the tariffs to bring about additional economic uncertainty and planning challenges. The research also found that almost 70% of finance chiefs foresee supply shortages and product delays, with a similar share executing new costs to restructure their supply chains. Experts agree that if tariffs had stayed in place, consumers would have faced significant price increases across various sectors: Groceries: Yale University’s Budget Lab estimated food prices would rise by 2.8% overall, with fresh produce increasing by 4%. Lower-income households would bear the brunt of these hikes as they allocate a larger share of their income to essentials. Clothing: Apparel prices were expected to climb within three to six months due to higher costs for imported textiles and manufacturing inputs. Back-to-school shopping could have become notably more expensive. Electronics: Items like smartphones and laptops, which are heavily reliant on China-manufactured components, would likely see steep price hikes under the 125% tariff rate, which is still in place. Although it has become something of an internet meme, the exponential increases in iPhone prices if they were manufactured in the U.S. is an example. These increases would not only strain household budgets but also contribute to broader inflationary pressures. Economists warned that sustained tariffs could reduce GDP growth by 0.6% annually and cost the economy $80–110 billion per year. Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday in an interview with CBS News that Chinese tariffs could create a “category 5 price storm” for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of “flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,” he added. The temporary freeze has reignited debates on how tariffs should be handled moving forward. Gina Bolvin of Bolvin Wealth Management emphasized that clarity in trade policy is essential for market stability. She described the pause as a “pivotal moment” but cautioned against celebrating prematurely given ongoing uncertainties. Bolvin said the timing also “couldn’t be better” given major financial institutions including Bank of New York Mellon, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo report earnings on Friday. “This pause may provide companies with a clearer backdrop for their guidance, offering some relief to a market hungry for direction,” Bolvin added. John Canavan from Oxford Economics noted that unilateral tariff policies create significant risks for global commerce. He advocated for negotiated agreements rather than abrupt policy shifts that destabilize markets. “There have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,” Canavan said. “Given what’s been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.” Other developments before the tariff reversal showed how companies were prepared to deal not only with increased costs but from the uncertainty of the tariff drama. New tariffs on low-value packages from China could hinder the plans of Shein and Temu. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 8), the White House has upped duties on those packages to 90% of their value, or a flat fee of $75 that would increase to $150. The duty goes into effect May 2, with the flat-fee hike happening after June 1. The shift follows Trump’s closing of a loophole that allowed Chinese imports under the “de minimis” threshold of $800 to arrive duty-free. Walmart announced it was pulling its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. “The range of outcomes for Q1 operating income growth has widened due to less favorable category mix, higher casualty claims expense and the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented,” the retail giant said in a news release Wednesday. Walmart had forecast operating income of 0.5% to 2% for the first quarter when it released fourth-quarter earnings result in February. The company is scheduled to release its full earnings May 15. Walmart said it expects first-quarter sales growth to be in line with a 3% to 4% outlook, with annual sales and operating income growth guidance unchanged, per the release, timed to coincide with the company’s Investment Community Meeting. Thousands of Canadian autoworkers were furloughed before the tariffs were rolled back. Now, Canada’s largest private-sector union is warning these temporary layoffs could be the beginning of larger troubles for the sector, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs,” Unifor President Lana Payne said, per the report. “The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see. My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” Around 6,000 Unifor members were laid off temporarily after Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on most countries, the report said. The bulk of those notices went to workers at a Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario, which produces Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, and which shut down for two weeks as the carmaker examines the impact of the tariffs, according to the report. Amazon reportedly canceled orders from multiple vendors in China and other Asian countries. The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen. It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients. Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments. About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Title: Potential buyers are probing Yahoo’s ad tech assets

Yahoo has held preliminary talks with investment banks and potential buyers of its demand-side platform, according to sources familiar with the developments. Yahoo officially turned 30 last month, and in its trailblazing pomp of the 1990s and early 2000s, it was known as “the gateway to the internet.” However, in recent years, its various owners and leadership teams have had different ideas on monetizing its assets. Under its current ownership, Apollo Global Management – the private equity giant that took over Yahoo in 2021 – this could include a future without ad tech assets, with suitors inquiring about its DSP in recent weeks. While the latest developments do not amount to a formal sales process — Digiday understands all such recent discussions have resulted from inbound inquiries — they indicate an appetite for further ad tech consolidation. Four separate sources, all of whom requested anonymity to maintain relationships, told Digiday Yahoo had contemplated the prospect of a potential sale of its DSP for some time, even if this was just a case of scenario planning. However, since the start of early 2025, speculation over such divestiture has become more palpable, with two separate sources informing Digiday that investment bankers have been jockeying to engineer such a deal. One source told Digiday that preliminary discussions with a competitive DSP – the source declined to name this party – took place in recent weeks, although such talks are understood to have since ceased. When Digiday approached them for comment, spokespeople for Apollo Global Management and Yahoo declined to comment on the record about such assertions. When Apollo Global paid U.S. telco Verizon $5 billion to take ownership of Yahoo in 2021, it inherited a full suite of ad tech tools. However, it has since significantly reduced such interests, including the 2023 closure of its supply-side platform, a process that involved significant layoffs. Instead, Yahoo has inked a long-term partnership with Taboola, whereby the latter party powers native advertising across Yahoo’s digital properties. More recently, Yahoo appears to have doubled down on its efforts to monetize its remaining ad tech asset, inking partnerships with Kroger, being first to market with transparency standards and placing it front-and-center of sales pitches at major trade shows. It is difficult to officially rank the industry’s top DSPs primarily because Google (the widely presumed market leader) doesn’t break out DV360’s earnings, although it is understood to be a “tier one” player along with The Trade Desk and Amazon. Yahoo is understood to be among the chasing pack – also in this cohort are players such as Adform, MediaMath, Nexxen, Quantcast, StackAdapt, Viant and Xandr – with its DSP understood to be growing in stature. Advertiser Perceptions data recently shared with Digiday suggests media buyers are increasingly eager to diversify the number of DSPs they work with, and many are eager to reduce their reliance on Big Tech offerings. Robert Webster, founder and CEO of TAU Marketing Solutions, told Digiday the Yahoo DSP is widely regarded as one of the best independent “feature-led DSPs.” He added, “If you look at it, for the first time in 10 years, the market is wide open… the DSP space is going to be transformed by AI in the next two years.” Sources consulted by Digiday claimed the most likely parties interested in the Yahoo DSP would either be competitors attempting to gain market share through consolidation or strategic players, such as a retail media network eager to add a buying tool to its stack. LUMA Partners CEO Terence Kawaja noted how mergers between sector rivals are rare occurrences, although he did note that much of the recent M&A activity in the space was driven by strategic acquirers. “All of the trends that drove that activity persist,” he added. “We still have the need for third- and first-party data… while the green shoots of AI and CTV also persist.” One anonymous source with knowledge of the developments said it was unlikely that another PE firm would buy the DSP without the data assets made available via Yahoo’s portfolio of web properties. “There’s probably not enough profitability for a PE to be that interested unless there’s a clear way of making cash, and if there was, then Apollo would have squeezed it out already, so it’s a tricky one,” added the source. Speaking with Digiday on the publication of LUMA Partners’ Q1 2025 market report, Conor McKenna, a partner at the investment bank, observed how T-Mobile’s ad tech acquisitions and Braze’s first scaled deal were notable throughout the period. He added, “Google announced a huge [$32 billion] deal [to buy Wiz],” he said, noting how this was the first such deal from a Big Tech player in some time. “I would interpret it as the expectation of a more conciliatory regulatory environment where they can potentially get big deals done.” However, given the current market uncertainty over the potential impact of tariff policies from the current U.S. administration, deal flow may be stalled in the coming months, according to LUMA Partners’s assessment. “Right now, we don’t know if that’s going to be a macro shock,” observed McKenna. “Right now, all we know is that there’s macro uncertainty.” Cloud Next 2025 showed how the giant wants AI to join creative departments.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. U.S. professionals are fueled by the desire to progress professionally, especially when it comes to ... More upskilling in tech Remote work is not the only factor in a job that U.S. professionals care about. Even though many would be happy to exchange work benefits like PTO and health insurance for the ability to work remotely, according to FlexJobs, American workers are almost equally fueled by the desire to learn new skills so they can progress in their careers, making this a top priority when seeking new job opportunities. A recent discovery by LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report 2025 noted that learning new skills is high on the agenda for employers who wish to attract and retain top talent, with survey respondents citing this as their number one turnover reduction strategy. Additionally, LinkedIn reported more than a quarter of professionals who are seeking to learn new skills this year and are keen on progressing in their jobs. Consequently, LinkedIn revealed its popular list of the top 50 large workplaces for professional growth and development. The best part about this list is that all employers included in the ranking are currently hiring, with some hiring for hybrid-remote and fully remote roles. So you’ll be sure to find an opportunity that matches your interests. Here are the top 10 employers from LinkedIn’s Top Companies 2025 report: Why did these employers make the cut for this list, you might ask? LinkedIn evaluated these large companies--who each have about 5,000 or more employees to be eligible for inclusion in the list--based on qualities such as enabling their people to stay ahead with AI upskilling and development, and the development of technical skills-building pathways internally. Notably, in a signal move for bank JPMorganChase, about 70% “of roles for experienced hires--or candidates with full-time work experience--do not require a college degree,” LinkedIn noted, which means that the bank is yet another big-name employer to join the ranks of others such as IBM who have taken steps to abolish degree credential requirements from their roles and actively promote skills-based hiring. To get hired by top-tier employers like EY, PwC, or JPMorganChase, you need to be a top-tier candidate. That doesn’t mean you need to have graduated from an Ivy League college, or have a perfect, prestigious resume filled with your accomplishments at Big Four employers. But what this does mean is you’ll need to find ways to creatively differentiate yourself from the rest. Here are some top tips and an action plan to achieve this: These 10 companies are hiring right now, and they’re actively looking for someone like you who is proactive and passionate about continuous growth, aligning with industry shifts and trends, and climbing the next rung of professional development. Employers who prioritize skills-first hiring and internal upskilling will win in the talent ... More competition Despite many of these companies being at the forefront of headline layoffs this year, there are still thousands of positions up for grabs as they move towards a more efficient workforce. Are you ready to join them?

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. US extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X.

China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). Instead, GTRI said, India should consider a limited “Zero-to-Zero” tariff deal on 90 per cent of industrial goods, a model already offered by Europe to the U.S. Read more GTRI report warned that a full FTA with the US could turn out to be a costly mistake. While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday.

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day.
