This week, we’re taking a closer look at Tesla’s Cybercab and Robovan reveals, the “complete disarray” at Fisker HQ, and a horrifying side effect of living in our modern world: AI summaries of your breakup texts. Let’s do this. Tesla finally revealed its Cybercab robotaxi. Unveiled at the company’s We, Robot event, the Cybercab looks like a smaller, sleeker, two-seater Cybertruck — and the company claims it’ll cost less than $30,000. In a surprise reveal, Elon Musk also unveiled a prototype of Tesla’s Robovan: An electric, autonomous vehicle roughly the size of a bus, designed for transporting people around high-density areas. Fidelity Investments confirmed that over 77,000 customers had personal information compromised during an August data breach, including Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses. The investment firm said in a filing with Maine’s attorney general that an unnamed third party accessed information “using two customer accounts that they had recently established.” Babbel CEO Arne Schepker is stepping down, and the company’s co-founder and former CEO, Markus Witte, is stepping back in to lead Babbel “into a new phase” as they search for Schepker’s successor. This new phase for the popular Berlin-based language learning platform, unsurprisingly, will involve AI. This is TechCrunch’s Week in Review, where we recap the week’s biggest news.

Title: How do you solve a problem like MariaDB? Cozy up to the community, says new CEO | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The new CEO of MariaDB (Plc) says he wants closer-knit collaboration with the foundation behind the eponymous open source database project. He cites the corporation’s newfound stability from its recent acquisition by a private equity firm as to why it should now be able to get on a firmer footing. It has been a turbulent two years for MariaDB, with its ill-fated public listing via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022 sending the company into a nosedive it never quite recovered from. Less than two years later, the Redwood City-based company was taken private by K1 Investment Management in a $37 million fire sale that was significantly below its opening day market cap of $368 million — which in turn was way below its peak private valuation of $672 million. Last month’s transaction means that MariaDB’s shares are no longer trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), though the three-month de-registration process means that the company is still technically public through early December. However, with a new CEO already in place in the form of ex-Micro Focus executive Rohit De Souza (pictured above), MariaDB is already preparing for life as a private company once more — and this will involve getting cozier with the foundation that bears the same name. “The [MariaDB’s] Foundation’s reason for existing in times past was there was a lot of uncertainty about MariaDB’s future,” De Souza told TechCrunch in an interview. “Today, with the backing of K1, there isn’t that uncertainty anymore.” The initial MariaDB project launched in 2009 as a response to MySQL falling under certain corporate ownership. MySQL is the popular open source relational database management system created by Michael “Monty” Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson back in the mid-’90s, who sold the commercial company behind the project to Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008. A year later, Oracle announced it was acquiring Sun Microsystems for more than $7 billion, spurring Widenius to create MariaDB as a community-developed “fork” of MySQL. In the wake of the deal, Widenius formed a couple of organizations, one called SkySQL (focused on MySQL services) and one called Monty Program (for MariaDB), which eventually merged and rebranded as MariaDB Corporation before going on to raise $230 million in funding to sell services around the MariaDB project. In tandem, the MariaDB Foundation (established in 2012) has been safeguarding the “interests of MariaDB users and developers” as an independent not-for-profit. Today, MariaDB is the 15th most popular database, according to DB-Engines Ranking, though that figure jumps to ninth for relational databases, and fourth for open source relational databases. There have been tensions between the two MariaDB bodies through the years, particularly around the corporate entity’s focus on building out proprietary products and tools — which MariaDB Foundation CEO Kaj Arnö suggested has been to the detriment of the open source project. But after MariaDB appointed a new CEO and executive team last May, relations thawed, Arnö noting at the time that the Plc and the Foundation were “rebooting their entire relationship” with shared goals centered around cooperation and openness. Twelve months on, and MariaDB has yet another new CEO. But an arguably more important factor is that it now has the backing of a major private equity firm, and it no longer has to pander to the pressures of the public markets. This could give MariaDB a little more freedom to get back to basics, in cahoots with the Foundation. “There’s like a billion downloads [MariaDB database] and a big, vibrant community. Our intent is to grow that community, and have the Foundation be the engine that helps that community grow,” De Souza said. “We’ve got fairly deep pockets [now] — that doesn’t mean that we’re going to go out and spend like sailors tomorrow, but we can run a decent business together. A closer involvement with the Foundation will help feed things that the community really needs into product development — it will help us understand the community, and we could also use the community more to test new ideas.” On the Foundation side, Arnö says that there are now “shared strategy sessions” taking place to find ways they can support each other’s efforts. He also echoed De Souza’s sentiments, adding that he doesn’t want to dwell too much on historical tensions. “The past is behind us — I want to focus on the future, and how we can all work together on a shared goal, and not elaborate on the past,” Arnö told TechCrunch. “I am now more optimistic about the relationship between the Foundation and MariaDB the Company than I have ever been since taking the CEO position in 2019.” Historically, the vast majority of the code for the core MariaDB Server product was provided by the MariaDB corporation, a reliance that led the Foundation to seek alternative sources. For example, last year it signed up Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its first “diamond” sponsor, which is committing €500,000 ($550,000) per year — more than any other sponsor. On top of that, the MariaDB Foundation is in the midst of bringing vector search (a major component of the AI revolution) to its main database, with Amazon one of the core contributors alongside the MariaDB corporation. While the “relationship reboot” between the two MariaDBs is surely positive for those in the community, the Foundation is continuing to lean into its relationship with Amazon, which is now one of the single biggest code-contributing corporations outside of MariaDB Plc. “AWS has recently stepped up to start contributing code for MariaDB Server,” Arnö said. “I find this to be exciting for a number of reasons, but in particular, of all the open source relational databases out there, AWS has specifically chosen to invest in MariaDB Server. MariaDB as part of AWS service offerings gives us great exposure to a large AWS user base, which feeds the overall community and collaboration we are trying to drive.” Today, MariaDB Plc claims around 200 employees, 40% of whom reside in North America, while nearly half are located in Europe. That’s somewhat fewer than what it had at the start of last year, with the company going through two rounds of layoffs amounting to more than 100 staff — one-third of the workforce. In addition, part of this restructuring has entailed ditching key products “not related to the core MariaDB Enterprise Server business,” including its SkySQL cloud database service. But despite all the cutbacks of the past 18 months, De Souza reckons that they’ll be more likely to see net growth in the coming months. “There are always going to be places that we’ve over-invested in or under-invested in. There’s always going to be some fine-tuning, but I expect MariaDB to grow — I do expect to infuse new talent,” De Souza said. “I do expect to augment the existing talent. There’ll be some areas where we have to change things. Obviously, it hasn’t worked in the past for a reason.” MariaDB grew off the back of more than $200 million in venture capital, and its failure in the public markets can be attributed to many things: the macroeconomic situation at the time, lukewarm financial performances, and the fact that it went public via the dubious SPAC route before it was close to profitable. Life as a private company, backed by private equity, couldn’t be more different — private equity is all about investing in underperforming businesses that have the potential to be stabilized and grow, and this usually starts with bringing in seasoned management. De Souza has a strong record in the enterprise realm, having previously worked at Intel, SAP, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, and most recently Micro Focus, where he was a senior executive through its $6 billion acquisition by OpenText. He was also previously CEO and president of data management company Actian, which was acquired by HCL and private equity firm Sumeru Equity Partners in 2018. And it’s this combination of experience and skills that De Souza sees as being one of the biggest assets that he brings to MariaDB. “It’s everything from helping navigate customers, helping drive how products are developed, how you actually build a sales team,” De Souza said. “Every one of those is required to build an enterprise software company. But really, it’s all about people: understanding the people that you need inside the company, and how you stabilize and build those teams.” While De Souza was hesitant to be drawn on the SPAC IPO debacle that his company endured before he joined, he did say that he was ultimately brought in to bring some “enterprise rigor” to the mix, now that it’s away from the pressures of being a public company. “You’ve got to run a company efficiently, and at a profit — it doesn’t take a genius to run a company at a loss,” De Souza said. “That’s part of why I’m here, it’s to bring some enterprise rigor to the business — how we develop products, what we invest in, how we create some consistency and focus around the communities.” Topics Nvidia, the AI chipmaker, just hit another record high OpenAI snatches up Microsoft generative AI research lead Meet Alarmo, Nintendo’s $100 sleep-tracking alarm clock Google signed a deal to power data centers with nuclear micro-reactors from Kairos — but the 2030 timeline is very optimistic In memory of Steve O’Hear Tesla Optimus bots were controlled by humans during the ‘We, Robot’ event Table Space eyes $2.5B valuation in India IPO Senior Reporter © 2024 Yahoo.

Title: TikTok axes 500 jobs in Malaysia, embraces AI for global content moderation

Content moderation got next on AI's job chopping block. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. TikTok laid off up to 700 employees, predominantly from its Malaysian operations (via Reuters). Contrary to the massive layoffs experienced across significant tech corporations like Microsoft that have been linked to tough economic times, the ByteDance-owned company plans to replace the laid-off employees with generative AI. The rapid progression of generative AI continues to be a menace for professionals across organizations, potentially rubbishing the false sense of job security. The affected employees' roles were centered on content moderation, ensuring clips published on the viral platform adhere to community guidelines. ByteDance claims it has established that AI can flag and scrap content violating TikTok's community guidelines with an 80% success rate. As such, the company is seemingly leaning toward automating content moderation using AI to expedite the process while simultaneously promoting efficiency. Two people with close knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the job cuts impacted less than 500 employees, not 700 as previously assumed. And as it now seems, the job cuts will likely expand to other regions and countries as TikTok scales greater heights with its content moderation automation process using AI. According to Microsoft's latest Work Trend Index report, most company executives won't hire anyone without an AI aptitude, "a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles." Interestingly, the report further suggests that AI creates job opportunities contrary to popular belief that it will render professionals jobless. However, company executives have raised concerns that despite having multiple vacancies across their organizations, there isn't enough talent to fill them. In a separate report, image generation tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are getting exceptionally good at creating structural designs, posing a great danger to the future of professionals in the built environment. Interestingly, the AI tools can't make simple, plain white creations. AI isn't leaving any stone unturned in the banking sector either. According to a study, 54% of banking jobs (more than half) have a high affinity for automation, with the possibility of 12% being augmented by AI. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman claims the fast adoption of AI in organizations will prompt software developers to stop coding, prompting them to upskill in the field to gain new skills. According to Garman: "If you go forward 24 months from now, or some amount of time — I can't exactly predict where it is — it's possible that most developers are not coding." NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar sentiments earlier this year. Huang claims coding could potentially be dead in the water as a potential career path for the next generation. Instead, he encourages the youth to explore alternative career options in biology, education, manufacturing, or farming. Related: OpenAI's o1 can pass OpenAI's research engineer hiring interview for coding at a 90-100% rate Interestingly, Elon Musk predicted that AI would take over jobs from humans, rendering work a hobby. The billionaire's prediction sparked controversy, with the vast majority asking how people would make a living. He painted a picture of a government social welfare concept that allocates a specific amount of money to everyone to cater to basic needs regularly. However, a job-free utopia raises questions about emotional fulfillment among people.

Title: Streaming Units Are Starting Beginning To Be Profitable
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/10/11/streaming-units-are-starting-beginning-to-be-profitable/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T15:08:37Z
Full Content:
After years of losing revenue, streaming video platfroms are beginning to be profitable. These units ... [+] have embarked on several strategies designed to grow revenue. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Only Netflix, up until recently, was able to reliably declare a profit among major streaming providers. The remaining streaming units, owned by legacy media companies, have only begun to be profitable. Becoming profitable comes at a critical time for media companies as revenue from cable television has been in a freefall. In August, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global took write downs on their linear TV business that collectively totaled $15 billion. Overall, the combined profits of Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery during the first two quarters of 2024 totaled $3.3 billion which is an increase from $683 million loss from the previous year, according to Yahoo Finance. In its most recent earnings report, Disney’s streaming unit (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) generated a quarterly profit of $47 million. It marked the first time Disney’s direct-to-consumer unit was profitable. When ESPN+ is not included, Disney recorded a loss of $19 million. One year earlier, Disney’s streaming division had reported a loss of $512 million. In its most recent earnings report, Paramount+ — the streaming unit of Paramount Global — became profitable for the first time. Paramount+ generated revenue of $26 million, compared to a loss of $424 million a year earlier. The streaming unit of Warner Bros Discovery (Max and Discovery+), had an adjusted loss of $107 million in its most recent earnings report. For calendar year 2023 however, the direct-to-consumer unit boasted a profit of $103 million. It marked the first time a streaming unit from a legacy media company had been profitable for an entire year. Although Comcast’s Peacock, in its most recent earnings report, reported a revenue loss of $348 million, the streaming unit is improving. Peacock, one year prior, had a revenue loss of $651 million. In all of 2023, Peacock lost $2.75 billion. Meanwhile, category leader Netflix continues to be the most profitable streaming provider. In its latest earnings quarterly report, Netflix recorded a net income of $2.15 billion, a year-over-year increase from $1.49 billion. Netflix revenue for the quarter was $9.56 billion, an increase of +17% from one year prior. There are several reasons for the recent improvement in revenue including increased subscriber fees, cracking down on password sharing and selling ads among other reasons. All streaming providers have to some degree increased their monthly subscriber fees to consumers. Monthly subscriber rates for leading streaming providers (Netflix, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Disney+ and Prime Video), have collectively grown from $59 in 2019 to $110 — an over 73% increase, The Drum reported. As an example, the monthly cost for the ad free tier of Disney+ has doubled from $6.99 in 2019 to $13.99 today. The monthly increase for the ad free tier of Peacock was even steeper, increasing from $4.99 in 2019 to $13.99. Steep increases in subscriber fees can backfire. A recent report from Deloitte found the households on average are paying $61 monthly, a year-over-year increase of 27% for on average four streaming providers. Many are of the opinion the cost is not worth it. In an interview, Michael Nathanson, Senior Managing Director at MoffettNathanson, noted, “For streaming, the average number of services per household has been stuck at four for a while. One of those four is Netflix, the second is Amazon—it comes with Prime—and third is some combination of Disney’s offerings. Fourth place is up for grabs. That’s what all the rest are fighting over.” The Disney acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and the merger of WarnerMedia with Discovery Communications in 2022 may have been caused by concerns of having too many streaming options. Another reason for revenue increases has been the cracking down on password sharing. Netflix took the lead in 2023 when it announced people using somebody’s password would have to start their own account. The risky decision has been working; in the past year, Netflix paid subscriber counts grew by 16.5%, exceeding estimates. Netflix is rapidly approaching 300 million (278 million) subscribers globally. Other streaming services have announced crackdowns on password sharing. Disney recently announced it would be implementing an initiative to crack down on passwords. Disney+ has introduced a new paid sharing tier. Disney’s Hulu has also curtailed password sharing. Warner Bros Discovery is also putting limits on password sharing. While Paramount+ and Peacock suggest they share passwords only within the household, neither have enforced that recommendation. As some subscribers dropped their streaming services, because of rising costs another revenue strategy has been launching an ad supported tier, at a lower subscription cost. In late 2022. both Netflix and Disney+ launched ad supported tiers. The announcements came at a time when advertisers were allocating more of the ad budget toward connected TV. In first quarter 2024, eMarketer reported 7.5% of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. have opted for less costly ad supported tier, the lowest of any streamer, followed by Max at 20.8%. Amazon’s Prime Video had the highest with 80% of subscribers receiving ads, followed by Peacock at 77.7%. According to the report, 25% of Disney+ subscribers are using the ad supported tier. For the 2024 upfronts ad dollars for Netflix grew by +150% compared to last year. There are forecasts Netflix will generate over $1 billion in ad revenue this year, surpassing Disney+. Streaming video has premium (award-winning) content coupled with younger viewers compared to linear television with fewer ads. All are appealing to advertisers. On the down side is streaming platforms have a higher cost-per-thousand than linear television. Media Dynamics reports for the 2024 TV upfronts ad dollars allocated to streaming video reached $11.1 billion, a 35% increase from 2023. Conversely, upfront ad commitments for broadcast TV and cable TV declined by -3.5% and -4.8% respectively. The ad dollars for both were below $10 billion. A study from Ampere Analysis had forecast in third quarter 2024, revenue from streaming video would be outpacing pay television for the first time. Furthermore, by 2028, the value of pay TV will be half the value it had been when it had peaked in 2017. Another strategy helping to build revenue is bundling, allowing consumers to sample new streaming services at a discounted price. The most familiar is the Disney bundle which combines Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, at a cost savings of over 40% when compared to buying the three services separately. Also, Comcast launched StreamSaver in May, a bundle available to Xfinity subscribers only. StreamSaver bundles Netflix Standard with ads, Peacock Premium with ads and Apple TV+ at a monthly fee of $15. In July. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery launched a bundling package of Disney+, Hulu and Max available to new and existing subscribers. The ad supported bundle costs $17 monthly with an ad-free tier costing $30. Last August a streaming sports bundle from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery called Venu was temporarily placed on hold by a U.S. District Court. The court sided with Fubo, a smaller streaming service that had filed an antitrust suit claiming the bundle would put them out of business. Venu is appealing the decision. There are also a number of promotions involving streaming providers such as Verizon’s myPlan and Walmart Plus among others. With many streaming users already subscribing to at least one of services being offered it can minimize the desired impact of bundling. Another trend has been a cutback in the amount of scripted content. With the streaming wars subsided after last year’s Hollywood strikes, streaming providers have opted for cutting back on costly original scripted programming. In the pre-strike year of 2022, there were about 600 original and scripted programs, which industry analysts conclude will be the high-water mark. Also, in a first, in 2023, the number of series released on streaming platforms had dropped. What has increased however, has been live streaming sports. S&P Global Market Intelligence projects U.S. sports rights cost $30 billion across linear television and streaming. The figure could grow to $35 billion by 2027. Driving the increase has been streaming driven by the deep pocketed Amazon, Apple and, more recently, Netflix and Alphabet. Amazon has been streaming NFL Thursday Night Football for three seasons and has added NASCAR. Starting with the 2025-26 season Amazon will be streaming NBA and WNBA games outbidding Warner Bros Discovery. Apple TV+ has been streaming a package of MLB games on Friday nights and MLS games. Alphabet’s YouTube has been streaming out-of-market NFL games with Sunday Ticket. Also, Netflix will be streaming two NFL games on Christmas Day. Over the summer Peacock streamed over 5,000 hours of the Paris Olympics averaging over four million viewers each day. According to Antenna, in its first week of Olympics, Peacock added 2.8 million new subscribers. Last January, Peacock live streamed an early-round NFL playoff game. For the game, Peacock added three million new subscribers, 71% of whom were still using the service two months later. (Prime Video will be streaming the NFL game this January.) Peacock will also be live streaming NBA games starting in 2025-26 and WNBA games beginning in 2026. Although revenue losses in their streaming units are abating, several media companies are continuing to cut costs. Paramount Global recently announced more layoffs reducing U.S. employees by 15% (2,000 employees), resulting in a savings of about $500 million. As part of the cutbacks will be the closing of Paramount TV Studios. Earlier in the year, Paramount had laid off another 800 employees. In July Paramount Global announced a merger with David Ellison’s Skydance in a $8 billion deal. Also, to cut costs, in September, Disney announced cutbacks impacting 300 employees across several divisions. In another cost-cutting maneuver Warner Bros. Discovery in July announced another round of layoffs impacting about 1,000 employees in the production, business affairs and finance units. Earlier in the month CNN laid off about 100 workers.

Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Plus, Home Depot requires corporate staff to work in retail stores. Greetings, comms pros! Let’s take a look at a few news stories from the past week and see what we can learn from them. 1. Spotify commits to ‘work anywhere’ policy amid RTO push at other companies As other companies like Amazon work to bring their employees back to their desks, Spotify is pushing in the other direction and reaffirming its commitment to allowing employees to work wherever they choose. According to Raconteur: “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” says Katarina Berg, Spotify’s CHRO. While she says she understands why some companies have returned to the office, “they are going back to what they know”, Berg is yet to find a reason to enforce a mandate for Spotify’s employees. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom?” she says. “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” Berg’s willingness to back her organization’s employees so publicly in the context of Spotify’s history of allowing employees to work remotely is refreshing at a time when other companies scramble to justify reasons to get people back to their desks. Speaking openly about the autonomy the company gives them in allowing them to make their own choices is a lesson in employee experience, employer trust, and employer branding that other companies can learn. Your employees are your greatest asset and give your company its identity. Treat them respectfully and like the talented professionals they are, and it’ll be a lot easier to recruit and retain people. 2. Report: Layoffs impact the business beyond job cuts Nobody likes to talk about layoffs. But what about the longer-term impacts they create for companies that they happen to? According to a study by Harvard Business Review, organizations that had “committed” employees felt layoffs even harder than those with less loyal employees. Additionally, intangibles like pride, future motivation, and recommendations to others outside the company each dropped by a factor of more than 10% following a layoff. Layoffs do a lot more than just let go of valued colleagues. They serve as a reset point for organizations, and if they’re not carefully planned, companies risk poisoning their cultural wells. By running all layoff comms through a lens of empathy and commitment to mission and values, these impacts can be lessened, even if there is some inevitable sour sentiment. 3. Home Depot requires corporate employees to work retail shifts Deeper interaction by corporate employees with front-facing workers can help create a deeper appreciation for the culture and function of the business. Home Depot is taking this a step further, and getting its desk workers to don orange aprons several times a year. The policy mandates corporate employees to spend one full shift in stores quarterly to better gain an appreciation for the business and culture, Home Depot said in a memo obtained by Bloomberg. According to Bloomberg: “We need to stay connected to the core of our business, so we can truly understand the challenges and opportunities our store associates face every day,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Decker said in the memo introducing the program. A company spokesperson said it’s been the company’s longstanding practice to ask staff to spend time in stores, with this new program being its latest initiative. What better way for communicators to learn about who they’re messaging with and to than spending a day in the shoes of front-facing workers? Comms pros do their best work when they understand the culture and values of a company inside and out. Tying on the ubiquitous Home Depot apron and learning firsthand about the challenges and opportunities of your frontline audience is a great way to achieve that goal, especially with the blessing of leadership. 4.

If the merger with Kroger doesn’t go through, the CEO of Albertsons Cos. Inc. said in court Wednesday that his company might have to consider layoffs and leave certain markets to remain competitive and financially secure in the long term.Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition.Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys. A merger of the two competitors would violate state antitrust laws, the attorney general’s office said.But Sankaran said the two chains see merging as the best way to compete against Walmart, first nationally in grocery sales, as well as such fast-growing food sellers as Amazon and Costco. Walmart and Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart, account for about a quarter of the country’s grocery business, he said.“We can do many things to improve the company, but at some point the ability to compete with the Amazons and Costcos and Walmarts of the world, you just need added scale. We knew we wouldn’t be able to get that by ourselves,” Sankaran said.Albertsons began looking for ways to grow and merging with another company was one of the possibilities. Soon after Albertsons and Kroger announced consolidation plans in October 2022, several United Food and Commercial Workers locals, state and local officials came out in opposition.The Federal Trade Commission has sued to put the merger on hold until it can finish its proceedings aimed at stopping the companies’ plan. A decision in the FTC’s lawsuit is pending.A trial is underway in the lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, whose complaints against the merger are similar to Colorado’s. In Colorado, Albertsons and Kroger are prime rivals in the grocery industry, according to an analysis presented by the state last week in court. The analysis produced by an expert witness for the state played down the competition posed by Costco, Amazon, Whole Foods and other retailers.But asked who he sees as Albertsons’ biggest threat, Sankaran said Walmart, Amazon and Costco are among his biggest worries. “These competitors are growing so fast and they’re already large. They’re who I worry about in the long run.”Sankaran said data on where customers in Colorado shop shows that for every $1 spent on groceries, Albertsons reaps 14 cents. Kroger takes in 16 cents and Amazon gets about 5 cents. Walmart captures the biggest share: 20 cents on the dollar. The rest of the money goes to a variety of entities, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.To try to ensure there will be competition in the market after the merger, Kroger and Albertsons have struck a $2.9 billion deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which would buy 579 of their stores nationwide. In Colorado, C&S would buy 91 Safeway and Albertsons stores and a dairy plant. Kroger would retain 14 of the stores in the state.Kroger and Albertsons have said C&S, a grocery distributor that now operates just 25 retail grocery stores, has the resources to take over the stores. But Roger Davidson, an industry consultant testifying Wednesday for the state, said he expects that stores bought by C&S will see declining revenue and some will likely close.Davidson said C&S won’t have enough people or a strong enough retail infrastructure to successfully run all the stores it plans to acquire.Jason Slothouber with the attorney general’s office asked Sankaran about the potential impacts on communities and workers if stores in more remote parts of the state close after the merger.“Even if C&S crashes and burns, you have this golden parachute for yourself,” Slothouber said.Sankaran acknowledged that he will receive a total of $43 million in equity and severance if the merger is completed. “I realize it’s a lot of money for a guy who came from India with a suitcase. I don’t take that lightly,” he said.Related Articles Retail | State says Kroger-Albertsons merger may cost Coloradans $500M per year; companies dispute claim Retail | Colorado next up to argue its case against Kroger-Albertsons mega merger Retail | Montbello’s status as a food desert to end next year with $97M project that includes grocery store, housing and more Retail | Kroger and Albertsons make a final pitch for their merger before a judge decides whether to block it Retail | A state’s experience with grocery chain mergers spurs a fight to stop Albertsons’ deal with Kroger But he called Slothhouber’s questions about stores closing and people losing their jobs “hypotheticals” that he couldn’t answer.Kroger and Albertsons have said that stores won’t close, people won’t lose their jobs and wages will increase if the merger goes through.

The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under new CEO Andy Jassy Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. "Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go." The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.
