Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they‚Äôre published. One of Elon Musk‚Äôs employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk‚Äôs biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young‚Äôs dual role ‚Äî working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency ‚Äî likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is ‚Äúduplicative.‚Äô‚Äô Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that ‚Äúwould cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality‚Äù and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to unwind the consumer agency‚Äôs operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young‚Äôs arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB ‚Äî which regulates companies that provide financial services ‚Äî has jurisdiction over Musk‚Äôs electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world‚Äôs richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, ‚ÄúDelete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.‚Äù ‚ÄúMusk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,‚Äù said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúAnd therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk‚Äôs personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.‚Äù Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk‚Äôs political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk‚Äôs payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk‚Äôs Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to ‚Äúadvise political and public policy.‚Äù Beyond that description, it‚Äôs not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company‚Äôs activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk‚Äôs family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk‚Äôs children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE‚Äôs activities, said that Young‚Äôs government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. ‚ÄúWhich hat are you wearing while you‚Äôre serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?‚Äù she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk‚Äôs private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will ‚Äúcontinue to participate‚Äù in a ‚Äúdefined contribution plan‚Äù sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a ‚Äúvice president‚Äù of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on ‚Äúpolitical and public policy,‚Äù the records show. While he lists the latter among ‚Äúsources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,‚Äù the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn‚Äôt respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn‚Äôt return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn‚Äôt responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll recuse myself if it is a conflict.‚Äù The revelation of Young‚Äôs apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration‚Äôs attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning ‚Äî actions one expert called a ‚Äúpretty clear-cut violation‚Äù of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he ‚Äúdid not even manage‚Äù the layoffs, ‚Äúmaking this entire narrative an outright lie.‚Äù A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn‚Äôt clear whether he did and the White House hasn‚Äôt answered questions about that. ‚ÄúThese allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE‚Äôs critical mission,‚Äù the White House said. Following ProPublica‚Äôs reporting, the aide‚Äôs work at the CFPB ended. On Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica‚Äôs coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to ‚Äúswiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.‚Äù ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it‚Äôs unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE‚Äôs efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. ‚ÄúIt matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,‚Äù she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB‚Äôs acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau‚Äôs staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency‚Äôs employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration‚Äôs first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB‚Äôs headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency‚Äôs acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted ‚ÄúCFPB RIP‚Äù with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including ‚Äúall contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.‚Äù Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk‚Äôs Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the ‚Äúpresent.‚Äù Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration‚Äôs cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB‚Äôs chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a ‚Äúreduction in force,‚Äù or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were ‚Äúprepared to implement the RIF‚Äù if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration‚Äôs proposed cuts. Read More In addition to his employment, Young‚Äôs disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau‚Äôs ‚ÄúProhibited Holdings‚Äù list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock‚Äôs value ‚Äî such as stripping the CFPB of its staff ‚Äî constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn‚Äôt responded to questions about that either. Al Shaw contributed reporting and Alex Mierjeski contributed research.

Title: Forbes Daily: America‚Äôs Largest Digital Bank Files For An IPO

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Price is one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption. But thanks to a new type of battery, General Motors plans to slash the cost of some of its rechargeable vehicles. The battery, which has been under development for a decade, uses more of the cheaper elements like manganese and far less cobalt and nickel than current lithium-ion cells. That will cut the cost of battery packs in models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer and Cadillac Escalade by more than $6,000, a GM executive told Forbes. And while GM currently falls behind Tesla as the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., that could change as Elon Musk‚Äôs firm struggles. Chime CEO and cofounder Chris Britt As the stock market rebounds, Chime, America‚Äôs largest digital bank, has filed publicly with the SEC for an initial public offering, revealing its detailed financials. Chime has catered largely to younger Americans earning between $35,000 and $65,000 and has built a sticky business by requiring customers to set up direct deposit to get access to a growing list of features. Donald Trump is considering accepting a plane from Qatar, a gesture from the energy-rich monarchy that plays directly to the billionaire‚Äôs ego. Trump has long preferred oversized planes, personalizing airliners too big to land in some airports over the more nimble jets that most executives prefer. Alan Marcus, a communications consultant who used to ride on Trump‚Äôs old Boeing 727, compared it to a stereotypical debate over the size of‚Äã one‚Äôs male anatomy. Prices rose less than economists expected in the first inflation report since President Donald Trump unveiled his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs. But while it was the most moderate inflation reading in over four years, the data doesn‚Äôt capture the full impact of tariffs on consumers‚Äîand the frequent changes in the tariff rates make it difficult to gauge what that will look like. In a move that could provide relief to ecommerce firms like Shein and Temu, the White House said it lowered tariffs on packages from China valued at less than $800 from 120% to 54%. Packages under that value were previously exempt from tariffs or customs duties through the ‚Äúde minimis‚Äù loophole, which Trump eliminated, then reinstated, then eliminated again. After Forbes uncovered financial problems and layoffs at Wondermind, the mental health startup cofounded by actor and business mogul Selena Gomez, it set off a debate over how much Gomez is really worth. Forbes found that Gomez is very wealthy, but not a billionaire, worth roughly $700 million‚Äîthough she still ranks among the wealthiest self-made women entrepreneurs in the country. A key court hearing took place Tuesday, as a coalition of small businesses are seeking to block President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs as legal challenges against the import taxes move forward. It‚Äôs unclear how the court will rule, and it‚Äôs only the first step in what‚Äôs likely to be a lengthy legal process, as multiple lawsuits have been filed. Trump meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara along with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin ... More Salman Al Saud. (Photo by Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Court/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after announcing plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, a significant boost to the country‚Äôs new leadership as it attempts to shore up international support after a nearly a decade and a half-long civil war. Addressing the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said he ‚Äúfelt very strongly‚Äù that dropping the ‚Äúreally crippling‚Äù sanctions would give Syria a chance. Operations at Newark Airport appear to have normalized after two weeks of chaos that included equipment failures in which air traffic controllers lost communication with pilots three times. The airport was under a ground delay Tuesday, but there were markedly fewer canceled and delayed flights, according to data from FlightAware. Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World‚Äôs Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista After a decade-long beef with the SEC as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, the world‚Äôs largest meatpacker was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company‚Äîincluding bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns of price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Over the past two decades, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista have turned their family‚Äôs South American meat business into a global goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Agnus Beef. The Batista brothers are the company‚Äôs largest shareholders, and Forbes estimates that Joesley and Wesley are worth $4.8 billion each. They have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil. But the Batistas‚Äô fortune changed when Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS‚Äô dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation. WHY IT MATTERS In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon, though a JBS spokesperson denies that. Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS ‚Äúmore resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.‚Äù MORE Who‚Äôs Afraid Of Big Bad Boar‚Äôs Head? The U.S. faces substantial potential economic losses as a Canadian travel boycott continues to intensify. Canadians comprise the single largest cohort of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S.: 35%: The decline in the number of Canadians road-tripping to the U.S. last month, compared to a 20% drop for air travel $20.5 billion: How much Canadian travelers spent in the U.S. in 2024 140,000: The number of jobs that would be jeopardized by just a 10% reduction in Canadian inbound tourism, the U.S. Travel Association warned In times of economic uncertainty, many employers turn to layoffs‚Äîbut there are hidden costs associated with cutting positions. Beyond the expenses like providing severance and increased administrative work, employee productivity can plummet, and studies have shown that voluntary turnover often increases as well. If it‚Äôs necessary to cut back, try to optimize management layers, reduce the workforce through natural attrition, and if you must lay off employees, be sure to treat them with dignity.

Good morning. One of the key accusers in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial testified Tuesday in court. R&B singer Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs for over a decade, spoke about joining in on the drug-fueled sex marathons that he called "freak offs." In today's big story, ESPN finally unveiled the streaming-only version of its channel, and it comes as streamers reevaluate how they judge success. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Brevan Howard taps a longtime JPMorgan dealmaker for a new senior role. Tech: Job cuts are officially underway at Microsoft. Business: The hidden intention behind some companies' RTO plans isn't about getting back to the office. But first, what channel stream is it on? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the last holdouts of the streaming era is finally making a move. ESPN unveiled plans ‚Äî and a price ‚Äî for its long-awaited streaming version of the sports channel. Business Insider's Peter Kafka has the rundown on Tuesday's launch event for ESPN's new service, which will cost $30 a month. (Not to be confused with ESPN+, which has been around for over seven years. While ESPN+ streams live games, the biggest sporting events can't be watched there without a cable TV subscription. Unlike ESPN+, this new streamer will include everything you'd get if you were watching ESPN on cable TV.) ESPN's willingness to finally cut the cord shows how much the TV landscape has changed. But it's not just streamers fighting for subscribers. From engagement to subscriber growth to profitability, streamers have different priorities, writes BI's James Faris. So what are the different strategies, and who is running them? James does a great job of breaking it all down, but here's a quick rundown. The engagement approach: Netflix, Amazon When you're at the top, you sometimes have to find new ways to define success. After clearing the 300 million subscriber milestone, Netflix is now focusing on keeping users engaged rather than just growing. The reason? Engaged users are good for ads, which is the next big opportunity the streamer sees. It's not alone, as Amazon went all in on ads last year when it automatically turned them on for Prime Video users who weren't willing to cough up $3 a month to remove them. The subscriber approach: Disney, Paramount+, Peacock For those not lucky enough to have a massive subscriber base, growing the number of users is still a priority. One challenge has been keeping the momentum from big events like the Olympics or NFL playoff games. Of course, sometimes you might have even more viewers than you realize. That's why password-sharing crackdowns are all the rage. The profitability approach: Max Subscribers. Engagement. Let's be honest, the end goal is the same: making money. Warner Bros. Discovery already conceded that Max won't rule the streaming roost. But it is in the black, something some of its peers can't claim. 1. Inflation surprisingly cooled in April. The inflation rate slowed to 2.3% last month from March's 2.4% year-over-year bump, making it the smallest increase since 2021. Still, forecasters said the effects of the trade war could show up as soon as next month. On the plus side, eggs are back on the menu for breakfast. 2. Brevan Howard hires Carlos Hernandez. The longtime JPMorgan dealmaker will be Brevan Howard's first-ever executive chair. A person close to the manager told BI that Hernandez's role will focus on high-level corporate strategy and client development. 3. Getting a job in secondaries. The investment strategy of buying stakes in private funds from investors who want to sell early used to be niche. Secondaries are now fundraising at record levels, and a lucrative career path is emerging. Here's how to land a job in the booming industry. 1. Microsoft's job cuts are here. The software giant has started culling managers and noncoders as part of its plan to shed about 6,000 jobs. It wants fewer managers with more reports, consistent with an industrywide push to flatten management layers. 2. AI companies stand to win in Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" ‚Äî for now. The bill includes a provision preventing states from regulating AI for 10 years, a godsend for companies like OpenAI and Meta. However, there's a good reason they shouldn't start celebrating yet. 3. The CEOs behind your favorite YouTube stars. Content creators from MrBeast to Smosh are hiring leaders from Hollywood, talent management firms, and creator economy startups to level up their businesses. These executives allow creators to focus on content ‚Äî and avoid burnout. 1. Employers have found a sneaky substitute for layoffs. Rather than conducting layoffs, some employers are using RTO mandates to get workers to quit. But companies adopting this take-it-or-leave-it approach to RTO can end up with the worst of both worlds, BI's Aki Ito writes. 2. You can now book private chefs and personal trainers on Airbnb. The company rolled out Airbnb Services, which lets users hire professionals like hairstylists or photographers to come to their Airbnb or home. An exec told BI it's one way the company is trying to win customers back from hotels. 3. Trump is asking Americans to do the one thing they hate most. Buying things is a national pastime, and Trump is the king of conspicuous consumption. But after issuing tariffs, the president is preaching austerity ‚Äî a misread of both America's economy and culture. Sony reports earnings.

The company had around 228,000 employees worldwide as of June, it says, meaning more than 6,500 could be affected by the cuts. It would be one of the company‚Äôs largest staff reductions since it cut 10,000 people in 2023. A Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch, ‚ÄúWe continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.‚Äù In April, Microsoft reported a solid quarter of $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 18%), which was even better than analysts expected. Even so, this new round of layoffs is expected to hit all levels, locations, and teams. The company also had layoffs back in January, though it said those were performance-based. This fresh round of layoffs is not performance-related, a spokesperson told CNBC. Thousands upon thousands of workers have been laid off from Big Tech companies in just the past year. Amazon and Meta also conducted layoffs in January. Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch. She is based in New York City.

BREAKING: Supreme Court skeptical about Trump‚Äôs plan to limit birthright citizenship Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it‚Äôs laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. ‚ÄúWe continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,‚Äù a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It‚Äôs likely Microsoft‚Äôs largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing ‚Äúunnecessary layers‚Äù in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn‚Äôt tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. ‚ÄúHow do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?‚Äù Nadella said. ‚ÄúAt a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don‚Äôt keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.‚Äù On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. ¬© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs

Microsoft (MSFT) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it‚Äôs laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people ‚Äî making it the company‚Äôs largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of ‚Äúorganizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.‚Äù (What, not ‚Äúvibrant‚Äù or ‚Äúrobust‚Äù?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an ‚ÄúAaron Judge-like‚Äù earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Google (GOOGL) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM), Spotify (SPOT), and Lyft (LYFT) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to ‚Äúfocus on the core,‚Äù often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers‚Äô group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday‚Äôs move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative.

Title: 4 Side Gigs Earn Up To $30k Annual Income For Full-Time Workers

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Side hustles are no longer optional in today's economy. Many American full-time workers need ... More lucrative side gigs like these to keep up with rising costs. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today‚Äôs tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn‚Äôt really extra anymore, that it‚Äôs a necessity for many of today‚Äôs workers. ‚ÄúFor many Americans, side hustles aren‚Äôt optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.‚Äù Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. ‚ÄúAnd with Trump‚Äôs tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,‚Äù she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they‚Äôre willing to dedicate five-to‚Äì10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they‚Äôre involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren‚Äôt worth it, you‚Äôre wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that‚Äôs over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: ‚ÄúGood writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,‚Äù Morgan insists. ‚ÄúThe ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.‚Äù She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need many clients to get started,‚Äù Morgan notes. ‚ÄúJust offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it‚Äôs a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.‚Äù Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. ‚ÄúOn platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it‚Äôs simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people‚Äôs stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,‚Äù Morgan recommends. ‚ÄúAfter one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‚Äòa gift for a colleague‚Äô or ‚Äògreenery on the desktop.‚Äô She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ‚ÄùIt takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. ‚ÄúFrom there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.‚Äù Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. ‚ÄúThese sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúYou can get $50 to $250 per participation.‚Äù She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. ‚ÄúTo get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,‚Äù she advises. ‚ÄúEven if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that‚Äôs already $200-300.‚Äù SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you‚Äôre tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

More from the series ‚Üí NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming ‚Äî with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn ‚Äúwent more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‚Äòhere‚Äôs our big, splashy new content program,‚Äô‚Äù said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. ‚ÄúIt was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.‚Äù Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. ‚ÄúWhat was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,‚Äù said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn‚Äôs ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. ‚ÄúBusiness influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.‚Äù But it‚Äôs the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers ‚Äî certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). ‚ÄúI think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing ‚Äî the larger monetary commitment,‚Äù said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. ‚ÄúWith more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we‚Äôre seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways ‚Äî it‚Äôs what the buzz is all about ‚Ä¶ The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we‚Äôre going to see the shift.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,‚Äù said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets ‚Äî yet. ‚ÄúBrands in a budget pinch are ‚Ä¶ really just trying to figure out where‚Äôs my biggest bang for my buck.‚Äù To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size ‚Äî some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: ‚ÄúAs media buyers, we‚Äôre really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they‚Äôre doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we‚Äôre watching TV,‚Äù Basis Technologies‚Äô Freed said. ‚ÄúCTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it‚Äôs shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,‚Äù said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely an appeal to that. It‚Äôs obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.‚Äù Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can‚Äôt be forgotten ‚Äî just like they offer the lion‚Äôs share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it‚Äôs a more even playing field than ever. ‚ÄúThis one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone‚Äôs getting connected through the pipeline,‚Äù said Jellyfish‚Äôs Dahir. ‚ÄúThe digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we‚Äôre not able to in the past.‚Äù For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,‚Äù noted Dahir. ‚ÄúThis creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback ‚Ä¶ because there‚Äôs too many touch points that you can tag it.‚Äù And that‚Äôs where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there‚Äôs a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. ‚ÄúOne theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it‚Äôs more about the curation of content and context,‚Äù said the buyer on background. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier ‚Äî when done right.‚Äù Added Basis Technologies‚Äô Freed: ‚ÄúFor buyers, it‚Äôs easier because we have more control ‚Äî we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.‚Äù Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy ‚Äî but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here‚Äôs the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.‚Äô And they‚Äôre going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.‚Äù In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers.

Title: Big Layoffs Are Hitting These Sectors The Hardest

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Depressed businesswoman getting laid off from her job, talking to her colleagues while carrying her ... More belongings and leaving the job. Layoffs have surged across an array of industries. Some of the problems are caused by a volatile economic landscape. President Trump‚Äôs initial tariff policy put a scare into both corporate executives and consumers. Additionally, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, are changing the workplace. Corporate restructurings due to changing circumstances added to the trend of layoffs. With more than 221,812 jobs eliminated in the first months of the year, workers and companies alike are forced to confront an ever changing challenging environment. Layoffs in 2025 are reshaping the workforce. Government, tech, retail, accounting, manufacturing, and logistics have been dealing with the biggest cuts. Driven by tariffs, cost-cutting, AI adoption, and federal downsizing, these layoffs show a shift in the economy. For workers, they‚Äôll need to stay proactive with upskilling, networking, and building financial resilience to navigate this storm. The layoff wave has spared few industries. Some sectors have borne the brunt more than others. Approximately one-third of layoffs stem from the government sector or related industries. Driven by federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration, agencies like the National Park Service (1,500 layoffs), U.S. Geological Survey (1,000), and the Bureau of Reclamation (100‚Äì150) are implementing significant reductions in force (RIFs). Tech The tech sector has the dubious honor of leading in layoffs, per TechCrunch. Over 23,400 jobs were cut in April alone. Companies like CrowdStrike (500 layoffs), Meta, Microsoft, and Block are downsizing. By comparison, 2024 saw 150,000 tech job cuts across 549 firms. High-profile firms like Amazon, Google, and Tesla also contributed to the tally. According to layoffs.fyi, 52,340 tech employees were laid off from around 123 tech companies. There were roughly 61,296 gov‚Äôt employees laid off by Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE initiatives, and about 171,843 total federal departures in 2025. U.S. retailers eliminated over 64,000 jobs in the first four months of 2025. This made the retail sector the second-hardest-hit industry after technology and ahead of most other consumer-facing industries, reported by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Bankruptcies at Joann Fabrics (19,000 jobs), Party City (16,000), and Big Lots (1,000) account for significant losses, with other retailers cutting jobs to brace for economic pressures like tariffs. Big Four management consultancy PwC laid off 1,500 U.S. workers (2% of its workforce), following 1,800 cuts in 2024. Other similar firms such as KPMG, EY, and Deloitte have also announced layoffs, citing low attrition and pressure on profit margins. Companies like Volvo (125 layoffs at its Charleston plant), General Motors (1,695 at its Fairfax Assembly plant), and Mercedes-Benz have announced mass layoffs. These cuts are tied to production pauses and cost-cutting amid economic uncertainty. UPS plans to cut 20,000 jobs in 2025, citing global trade policy changes and tariffs that discourage shipping. Trucking and retail are also expected to face mass layoffs due to tariff-driven economic pressures. The Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs are disrupting supply chains and raising costs, particularly in retail, logistics, and manufacturing. UPS explicitly cited ‚Äúchanges in global trade policy‚Äù as a driver for its 20,000 job cuts. Economists warn that tariffs could trigger stagflation or a recession, further pressuring companies to downsize. Many companies are streamlining operations to boost efficiency or profitability. CrowdStrike‚Äôs 5% workforce reduction aims to achieve a $10 billion annual recurring revenue target, while PwC‚Äôs layoffs address low attrition and bottom-line pressures. Tech firms are cutting middle managers and embracing AI-driven or self-led teams. The rise of AI and automation is displacing jobs, particularly in tech and manufacturing. Retail giants like Joann Fabrics and Party City faced bankruptcies, leading to massive layoffs. Even surviving retailers like Big Lots are cutting jobs to stabilize finances. The Trump administration‚Äôs push to shrink the federal government has led to mass firings and hiring freezes, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) initially issuing but later revoking some layoff notices. This creates uncertainty for federal workers. What Should Workers Know About Layoffs Here‚Äôs what you need to know and what to do. Monitor your sector for signs of instability. Retail and tech workers should be vigilant, given their high layoff rates. Federal employees need to track policy changes, as further RIFs are expected. Resources like WARNTracker.com and Layoffs.fyi provide real-time data on announced layoffs. In tech, generic skills won‚Äôt cut it. Identify niche skills your employer or competitors lack. This includes AI tools. If your company doesn‚Äôt offer it, invest in training to keep current and ahead of the pack. For retail or manufacturing workers, cross-training in adjacent roles like logistics or e-commerce. Continuous learning is a non-negotiable, as you don‚Äôt want to be left behind. Layoffs often come with little warning. Severance packages may be minimal or not offered. Put aside an emergency fund that can last at least around 6‚Äì12 months of living expenses in savings. Don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs beneath you to take on a side hustle to bring home some much needed money. Start networking. Relationships can open doors to new opportunities. Engage with industry peers on platforms like LinkedIn, attend virtual or in-person events, and reconnect with former colleagues. A strong network can help you land a role before layoffs hit. Layoffs can feel personal, especially when companies like Meta label affected workers as ‚Äúlow performers.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let it bring you down. Seek advice and support from mentors or career coaches. Reframe a layoff as an opportunity to pivot to a more stable or fulfilling role. To be fair, it‚Äôs easy said than done. Tariffs and trade wars are sometimes scapegoats for companies. They may use these trends to conduct firings, pivoting to AI-driven models. The tech sector‚Äôs volatility, for instance, isn‚Äôt solely about innovation. The tech sector misjudged the market and overhired during the pandemic boom. Now companies are paying for it by over-correcting to appease shareholders. Workers should be skeptical of corporate narratives. When companies cite ‚Äúlow attrition‚Äù as a layoff rationale, it‚Äôs often code for protecting profits over people. Similarly, the ‚Äúlow performer‚Äù label at Meta looks like a tactic to deflect blame from poor strategic planning. The real risk for workers isn‚Äôt just losing a job. It‚Äôs being left behind in an economy increasingly prioritizing automation. On the flip side, this chaos presents opportunities. Sectors like healthcare and transportation are adding jobs, and remote work remains a viable path in tech. Workers who adapt by mastering high-demand skills, building personal brands, or exploring entrepreneurial ventures can thrive despite the uncertainty. The key is self-leadership. Keep your eyes open for opportunities. Don‚Äôt wait for employers to dictate your future.

Title: Intel's distributed manufacturing might have given it a lifeline

Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî Intel has been down in the dumps lately. Between the awful Raptor Lake instability scandal, disappointing Arrow Lake launch, canceling the much-hyped 20A node, and waves of layoffs, the chipmaker seems stuck playing defense. Intel's stock price hasn't recovered from the massive drop, and AMD continues to rack up wins. Even Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, publicly acknowledged the myriad of challenges the company is facing. What you might have missed, however, is that Intel has been nurturing a long-term manufacturing pivot to redefine its role in the global semiconductor ecosystem. Possible tariffs on semiconductor chips from outside the U.S. are only the latest incentive for Intel to increase local manufacturing. With billions invested in both domestic and international fab expansion, and a resurgent foundry business, Intel is trying to become the top player in a world that cares a lot more about where the chips are coming from. It won't be easy, but it's necessary In case you didn't know, Intel holds the most U.S.-based manufacturing plants among chipmakers, which could be a huge shield against new semiconductor tariffs in the near future. Once the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, Intel, for the first time, outsourced the manufacturing of a major CPU lineup to TSMC. Intel's in-house foundry failed to meet expectations, and it was forced to use TSMC's cutting-edge process nodes. Thanks to the $7.86 billion in CHIPS Act funding by the government, Intel has received the green light to invest in projects across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. The CHIPS Act funds alone aren't nearly enough, but that hasn't stopped Intel from pouring $32 billion into two new fabs in Arizona, around $3.5 billion into advanced packaging plants in New Mexico, and $28 billion into two new fabs in Ohio (production is delayed to 2030, though). Even Oregon is getting a 300mm foundry plant. If the Trump administration goes through with additional tariffs on non-U.S. chips, Intel's domestic manufacturing capabilities could prove to be a strong moat. Almost every company outsources its chip manufacturing to TSMC, Samsung, and other Asian fabs, so Intel's strong domestic base can be one of the key levers in its gradual revival. The company is clearly betting big on expanding domestic operations; it's not a half-baked strategy anymore. I certainly don't. Intel isn't just hoping to get its home affairs in order; its overseas expansion is also ramping up. In 2024, its long-awaited Fab 34 joint venture in Ireland began ramping up production using the Intel 4 (its first EUV-based node) and Intel 3 process nodes. In Israel, Intel invested around $25 billion to build Fab 38 after a $3.2 billion subsidy from the Israeli government. Poland also greenlit $1.9 billion in state support last year for Intel's new $4.6 billion plant. Even in Germany, Intel plans to invest over $30 billion in two fabs, supported by $10.7 billion in government subsidies under the European Chips Act. These international fabs aren't just for capacity expansion but also geopolitical hedging in an increasingly unpredictable landscape. Although some of these projects have been delayed, the increasing willingness of several countries to subsidize Intel's global expansion shows their commitment to reducing reliance on the likes of TSMC and Samsung. This distributed manufacturing model could help Intel sidestep future supply chain bottlenecks and regional disruptions, like we saw during the pandemic and the recent Taiwan earthquakes. Intel has outlined its new processes for the next few years, but what does it all mean? A big piece of Intel‚Äôs pivot is its foundry business ‚Äî and it‚Äôs finally gaining traction. At Intel‚Äôs 2024 Foundry Direct Connect event, CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had already signed several customers for its upcoming 18A process. The list now includes names like Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Qualcomm, and defense contractors Trusted Semiconductor Solutions and Reliable MicroSystems. Intel had also announced a collaboration with Arm to produce its SoCs using the 18A process node. And most recently, Intel and TSMC agreed to enter into a joint venture whereby the latter would own 20% of Intel's foundry business. This is a huge vote of confidence in Intel's revitalized process roadmap. It signals that customers are at least willing to bet on Intel again. The company's plan to regain process leadership hinges on the success of 18A as well as future nodes such as 14A. Now structured as a subsidiary, Intel's foundry arm could play a huge role in Team Blue's resurgence. Intel might be on its way to becoming a company that doesn't hoard in-house manufacturing, collaborates with rivals, and treats its fabs as a revenue stream instead of just a moat. An unlikely duo. Intel has been pursuing smart capital, distributed manufacturing, and a resurgent foundry business in a bid to regain process leadership and solve its financial woes. Aided by federal grants, international subsidies for global expansion, and collaborations with the biggest names in the business might just prove to be the push Intel needed to regain its lost sheen. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved TSMC has denied any joint venture with any firm recently during their lastest earnings call/conference call. The cat's out of the bag on the Arc B770. Arm processors have shaken up the market, but x86 isn't folding any time soon These PlayStation 2 games are so rare and expensive that you may never get a chance to own them.

Title: Companies are going hardcore. It means one classic piece of career advice is getting more crucial.

A few big companies have been in the news for cutting underperformers and rewarding high performers. If you're looking to advance your career or keep your job in an increasingly frozen job market, you should take advantage of the classic advice to document your work wins and accomplishments. Keeping track of your performance can be crucial to getting a raise or a promotion, and for job security. Microsoft and Meta have made performance-related job cuts. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported that "Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers." Emily Field, a partner in McKinsey & Company's people and organizational performance practice, said performance management tends to follow economic and talent cycles. Companies were more relaxed about it during the pandemic and the Great Resignation, when workers were quitting their jobs en masse. But now the Great Resignation is over, hiring has cooled, layoffs are still low, and more workers are staying put. That more static labor market could mean demonstrating your value at work can be even more important to get promoted or to try to protect your role from layoffs. "What we're seeing is, particularly with AI, particularly with economic headwinds, we're seeing organizations say, we need to focus on high performance to be able to win, to be able to innovate, to be able to beat our competitors, and therefore we need to focus on performance management," Field said. Below is advice on how to document your wins, who needs to see them, and how often you should be discussing performance. Amy Lentz, the founder of Hack Your HR and chief people officer of footwear company Toms, said, "If you are creating value in your job, I think it's important to document," Lentz said. "Where people get kind of hung up is, 'Well, what is success and how do I measure it?'" Vicki Salemi, a career expert for Monster, said if a company is figuring out layoffs and their budget, workers need to also think of their job in terms of numbers. "They're thinking about in terms of your wins, but also money saved, time saved as well as money earned, time earned in terms of efficiencies, streamlining," Salemi said. Field said it's always been important to have quantifiable metrics. But in today's economy, "it's even more important to be able to say, this is how I'm contributing to the organization's success." Salemi said not all companies have quantitative performance ratings because they are having ongoing conversations about performance and don't think there needs to be a formal process. "In that case, it may be harder for you to show that you're a strong performer if they don't go by metrics," she said. Salemi said to focus on what you can do to be a good employee, including whether you are hitting or exceeding goals and expectations. If you are worried about layoffs, Salemi said to ask your boss what you need to do differently or what you need to prioritize. "That shows engagement, that shows that you care, and that you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work and hopefully get honest, helpful feedback," Salemi said. "Your boss might say, 'It's the company. It's not you.'" Lentz said documented wins should be measurable, objective, and factual, and less about your perception of that success. She said to document what you did, the outcome, and how it brought value. Salemi said to get in the habit of quantifying what you do because this can also be helpful if you apply for a new job. Salemi added that you can also document work testimonials and feedback you have received. Salemi suggested workers document their success in real time, even if it's just a note on their phones that they can refer back to. However, she advised against showing them to your boss after every success. "You do need to do that periodically and when it matters," Salemi said, adding that a good time to do so is during your organization's review of salaries, after a big project, or overcoming some work hurdles. Lentz suggested making a document that you can add to and share with your boss, arguing that it could be more effective than just tracking everything in a single annual review. Field said setting goals is important for documenting successes. She said to have check-ins with your manager because your priorities and what you need to deliver on might change over time. Lentz suggested asking in your one-on-one meeting with your boss for a conversation in the next few months about goals and how to spend your time, so you can understand if you are working on what is of value at the company. Salemi suggested asking your boss if they have a minute to discuss how to be rated as exceptional at the company this year and what metrics they need to see from you. Salemi said even if your boss isn't numbers-focused, you need to include figures in your documentation because your manager won't be the only one evaluating your performance. She added that it can also be important if you are considering an internal job switch. "The first thing that potential new boss is going to do is they'll want to see your performance review," Salemi said. "It's important to highlight your wins and that means including numbers."

Title: Marx wasn't entirely wrong on the lay of capitalism; he was just early

Karl Marx described a world of two main classes: those who owned the means of production (the bourgeoisie), and those who sold their labor to survive (the proletariat). His vision reflected the industrial world of the 19th century‚Äîfactories, landlords, and mass labor. Today, we live in a world of startups, social media, and digital nomads. It might seem like 'class' is obsolete. But when we peel back the layers, we find that class, as he saw it, never disappeared ‚Äî it just changed form. So what counts as ownership today? In Marx's time, ownership meant factories, land, and physical infrastructure. Today, it's code, platforms, patents, and data. The owners are no longer factory tycoons; they are tech moguls. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta don't just sell products ‚Äî they own the channels through which digital life flows. These platforms are the modern means of production. If you want to reach customers, communicate, work, or learn, you often do it through their systems. This control gives them immense leverage. They extract fees, set rules, harvest data, and shape behavior ‚Äî not just through economics, but through algorithmic influence. They don't just benefit from the market ‚Äî they define it. It‚Äôs true that anyone can start a business today. Anyone can code, freelance, or build an audience. And some people do rise: Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others began with modest means and built empires. But these are rare stories. Most founders fail. Most people lack the capital, networks, and insulation to survive repeated failure. Success often comes not from a single stroke of genius but from persistence, timing, and the ability to fail safely. In other words, the field may appear open, but it isn‚Äôt level. A few make it. Many don‚Äôt. And even among those who ‚Äúsucceed,‚Äù control often passes to the investors and platform owners behind the curtain. The modern ladder still exists ‚Äî but it‚Äôs taller, slipperier, and guarded by gatekeepers with venture capital. If Marx's class model still applies, how do we translate it to today? The bourgeoisie are now the platform owners: the founders, VCs, and institutional investors who control the infrastructure. The petty bourgeoisie are creators, startup founders, and engineers with some equity. They have partial control, but they‚Äôre vulnerable to policy shifts and market forces. The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass‚Äîspam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they‚Äôre governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn‚Äôt disappeared ‚Äî it‚Äôs been digitized. The so-called ‚Äútech middle class‚Äù is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don‚Äôt control. A change in TikTok‚Äôs algorithm, YouTube‚Äôs payout structure, or Apple‚Äôs App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old ‚Äî shopkeepers, artisans, and traders ‚Äî they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx‚Äôs time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality ‚Äî though now dressed in tech jargon ‚Äî is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We‚Äôre no longer marching on factory floors. We‚Äôre negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn‚Äôt foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre factories or platforms ‚Äî they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don‚Äôt need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs rich and who‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about who controls the systems. Most of us still don‚Äôt. Until we do, Marx isn‚Äôt irrelevant ‚Äî he‚Äôs just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field.

The proletariat are gig workers, freelancers, coders, and even some white-collar workers. They trade labor for money but lack durable ownership. The lumpenproletariat includes the informal digital underclass‚Äîspam farms, ghostwriters, data labelers in developing countries. Capital itself, other than money, was once largely land and machines, but now is code, platforms, and IP. The modern worker has more flexibility, but often less security. Gig workers can set their hours, but they‚Äôre governed by opaque algorithms. A freelance designer can work for clients worldwide, but lacks health insurance or legal protection. Even highly skilled tech employees may face burnout, layoffs, and constant performance tracking. We call it freedom, but it often feels like fragmentation. Workers are disconnected, competitive, and disposable. Unions are rare in tech. Contracts are short term. Protections are weak. The proletariat hasn‚Äôt disappeared ‚Äî it‚Äôs been digitized. The so-called ‚Äútech middle class‚Äù is also precarious. Product managers, engineers, creators, and micro-founders may enjoy moments of stability, but their position is fragile. They rely on platforms they don‚Äôt control. A change in TikTok‚Äôs algorithm, YouTube‚Äôs payout structure, or Apple‚Äôs App store policy can cut off their revenue overnight. Like the petty bourgeoisie of old ‚Äî shopkeepers, artisans, and traders ‚Äî they live between two forces: monopolistic capital above them, and desperate labor below them. They aspire to climb, but often fear falling. So, what separates today from Marx‚Äôs time? Mostly the aesthetics. Instead of smokestacks and tenements, we have coworking spaces and remote work. Instead of foremen and shift bells, we have dashboards and Slack notifications. But power still flows toward ownership. Profit still depends on control. And inequality ‚Äî though now dressed in tech jargon ‚Äî is still a structural feature. The conflict hasn't vanished. It's just harder to see. We‚Äôre no longer marching on factory floors. We‚Äôre negotiating rates on Upwork, battling for reach on Instagram, and hoping for funding from investors. The language is new. The struggle is not. So was Marx right? Perhaps on his initial analysis. He couldn‚Äôt foresee the internet, social media, or SaaS. But he understood something timeless: when a small group owns the tools of production‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre factories or platforms ‚Äî they will shape the world in their favor. No, we don‚Äôt need to embrace communism to admit this. But we should be honest about how capitalism concentrates power. And if we value real opportunity, we should focus less on hustle culture and more on who owns the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Class isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs rich and who‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about who controls the systems. Most of us still don‚Äôt. Until we do, Marx isn‚Äôt irrelevant ‚Äî he‚Äôs just updated. Thien Ooi is an engineer who works in the tech field.
