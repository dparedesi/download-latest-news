Title: Local organizer wants to fix REI from the top—and REI is fighting to keep her off the ballot

REI is having an identity crisis. Originally formed as a co-op in 1938, it earned a strong reputation in our community for its commitment to environmental issues, fair treatment of workers, and climate education initiatives. These values fostered generations of loyal customers who felt good about supporting the company. But over the past few years, REI has appointed a decidedly corporate-leaning board of directors, with former executives from Exxon Mobil, Starbucks, and McKinsey. Employees identify this shift as the start of anti-worker treatment at the company, like unpredictable scheduling and waves of layoffs, which the company attributes to slow sales. And while it’s true that REI’s finances have fluctuated in recent years, reports of its financial death are greatly exaggerated. In 2020, in the first year of COVID-19, the company sold its newly completed Bellevue headquarters to Meta for $390 million. And then when people took to the outdoors for safe exercise, REI’s sales boomed: up 37% in 2021 to a total of $3.7 billion, reporting a $97.7 million profit. REI reported a slight uptick to $3.8 billion in revenue in 2022 and $3.76 billion in 2023, but somehow still managed to lose millions in both years. That mismanagement at the top has resulted in repeated waves of layoffs: 167 people were laid off in 2023, then 357 in 2024, and 428 more this month, shuttering its beloved outdoor education Experiences arm. In 2022, REI’s New York City SoHo location was the first of its 187 stores to unionize. Nine others, including their Bellingham store, have since followed suit. REI has refused to negotiate a contract with the REI Union for over two years now and retained Morgan Lewis, a notorious union-busting law firm that also represents Amazon and SpaceX, and previously counted Donald Trump as a client. This week, 63 lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders sent a letter to REI urging them to bargain fairly with their workers and stop their union-busting activity. CEO Eric Artz announced his retirement last week, with new CEO Mary Beth Laughton taking over on February 3. She inherits a company with shaky finances and a once-sterling public image that has suffered in recent years. REI claims they have a transparent and democratic process for their annual board elections, yet candidates must be approved by the current board to even appear on the ballot to be voted on by its members. Workers are currently ineligible to run for the board, as well. However, Shemona Moreno, a local climate activist, longtime REI member, and REI Union-endorsed candidate, is running to hopefully steer REI back to its roots. The current board will decide which candidates will be allowed on the ballot at their meeting on Monday, February 3. You’re running to help return REI to its roots. Can you introduce yourself to folks who don’t already know about what you do? Shemona Moreno: I'm the executive director at 350 Seattle. We're a local grassroots non-profit focused on climate justice and the intersections of climate and workers' rights, abolition, and a variety of issues because we believe we can't solve our climate crisis in a silo. I've been with 350 Seattle since right after Trump was elected the first time. I was a nanny at the time. That was an activating moment for me to move from supporting from the sidelines to becoming more of a participant in my community and learning how to be an activist. So I started off as a volunteer with 350 Seattle, and then I had the opportunity to join the staff in 2018. I became executive director two years ago, and am starting my third year as ED now. I wouldn't say I've always been a climate activist, but it's something I grew into. My mother was really into activism, specifically around racial justice issues and police accountability, so I grew up going to actions and action-planning meetings with my mom. And here I am now doing similar work, working with people who care about what our future is going to look like. The question is: how are we thriving in our future and not just surviving? What are some projects you’ve worked on with 350 Seattle that you’re proud of? Around 2018 when the Green New Deal came onto the scene, we made a bit of a pivot at 350 Seattle to be focused more on solutions that will replace a lot of this infrastructure that we're trying to dismantle. We still need water. We still need food. So how are we doing that sustainably? What are the solutions that work with the community instead of against it? We ran a campaign called Solar Schools, working with other unions like the Seattle Education Association and MLK Labor to take levy money and invest it in renewable energy. We felt strongly we should be putting solar panels on top of our schools, and provide heating, cooling, and air filtration to all of our schools to keep our kids safe. We won that, and those projects are now underway. Another campaign we ran and won was called Healthy Through Heat and Smoke, which was another levy fight. We pushed Seattle Parks to invest in proper heating and cooling because out of the 26 community centers in Seattle, only three or four of them have air conditioning. In the 2021 heat dome, people died because they didn't have anywhere to go. What’s the pitch for your candidacy? What separates you from REI’s current board members? I’m a voice for the people who do not have representation on that board. I'm a voice for the workers. I'm also a voice for the people who actually care about preserving the planet, the air, and the water, and the considerations that's going to take. As you look at these issues that are confronting REI, what’s your vision for what REI could be? What is REI now? What are they doing? And who are they aligning themselves to? We're seeing them get rid of a lot of the things that support the members and the workers. We just saw a bunch of layoffs. So what's next? What else is REI going to compromise on for the sake of making money for a few people? I think we could learn a lot from the workers who actually speak to the consumers at brick and mortar stores. The members have good ideas. There's value there. I think you could do an audit and ask, what do people want from REI? And not just people who have lots of money, but regular people who could say, ‘I would go there a lot more if it was accessible to me in this way.’ People are now thinking carefully about how they spend their money. Does REI want to be one of those companies that's put on a boycott list? Or do they want to be one of the companies that's celebrated? We could have a company here that's thinking about us, that cares about the issues that we care about. And right now, it seems like REI does not. Do you have any comment on the news that REI is canceling its Experiences arm? Is this the kind of thing you would support if you were on the board? When I first joined REI as a member, I did some of the Experiences before I bought anything. I was just getting into hiking and learned about different tools, how to keep myself safe, what are the things that I need to know when I start journeying out into the wild to make sure I’m doing it respectfully. I think those Experiences set REI apart from its competitors for me. So this news is a bummer. I'm curious what led to that decision. It seems like the capitalist mindset of ‘it wasn't making money, therefore, it wasn't useful.’ But do we always have to be thinking about whether or not something is making money? Is that a good metric of real value? With over 3,000 members supporting your candidacy and lawmakers urging REI to listen to their workers, do you see this as a mandate for your board seat? It is a clear mandate. I believe 100 percent that things need to change. At the very least, we should change the way the co-op board operates. There should be representation from workers. It's not hard! We saw PCC do it and PCC is still around. It didn't implode by adding two workers' voices onto that board. Another place we can start is bargaining with the union in good faith. Listening to your workers around safety issues and things that need to be fixed, that is also not an impossible task. You'll probably spend less money on it than you would paying the union-busting firm that's represented the likes of Amazon and Trump. Like, come on. Do you really want to align yourself with them? What does success look like for this company if they're going to continue to alienate their base? REI is now claiming they never received your application for the board election. But you’ve shown me screenshots of your submission, sent ahead of the deadline. What gives? I emailed my application before the deadline. The best case scenario is someone didn't check their spam folder. The worst case scenario is REI is afraid of a pro-staff candidate for Board. This is not the REI I know and love. I applied to run for the board to be a voice for the people in green vests who make REI great but who are not allowed a voice on the co-op’s board of directors. More than 3,000 REI members and customers signed a petition in support of my candidacy for the board to bring REI back to its roots, and ensure the company walks their talk on sustainability and worker rights. REI must listen to its member-owners. So where does this go from here? If REI rejects your candidacy, are you planning to run again? There’s a bill in the Washington State Legislature that would require Washington businesses designated as a co-op to include employees on the board and follow a transparent democratic process for elections. I personally rally readers to support that bill. Contact your legislators and make sure they're hearing all of our voices across Washington State in support of that bill. That’s a good next step if I don't make it onto the board. And I'm open to running again if that is something workers in the union would like of me. But this isn’t all about me. It's about the workers at REI and the union. I'm just an ally, and this is how I can be in support of the union and the workers, by following their lead. I would surely do it again. We have to stand up and hold them accountable because at the end of the day, they're making all this money, but we're the people who actually buy things. We're the people that work. They can't do this without us. They need us. Conor Kelley covers labor for The Stranger. He is currently being priced out of Capitol Hill.

Title: Starbucks and Workers United turn to mediator as contract talks stall

Starbucks (SBUX-1.20%) and the labor union representing roughly 10,000 employees have agreed to bring in a mediator to help move forward with ongoing contract negotiations. The decision follows months of bargaining that had previously paused in December, after union workers argued the company had yet to present a comprehensive offer. In a joint statement, both Starbucks and the union expressed their commitment to working with a mediator to address the “complex issues” at hand and reach fair agreements for both sides. “Bringing in a professional mediator is a positive step toward securing fair union contracts,” said Michelle Eisen, a 14-year barista and bargaining delegate. “We’re optimistic that Starbucks will finally move off their fixed position on wages and benefits as we continue these negotiations.” Union workers have been vocal throughout the process, which began in April 2024, including during a high-profile strike last holiday season. On Christmas Eve, baristas walked off the job to demand better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The strike helped build momentum for the union’s efforts, as Starbucks employees continue to push for a fair deal. In addition to ongoing contract talks, Starbucks is making changes to streamline operations. The company plans to lay off some employees in the next two months, though it remains unclear whether these layoffs will affect only corporate roles or include frontline workers. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol also announced recently that the company’s “open-door” policy, which previously allowed anyone to enter stores, would now limit service to paying customers only. This policy shift includes ramping up security at select locations and even closing stores where security measures are not proving effective. As part of his “Back to Starbucks” strategy, Niccol has made other moves to reshape the company. Recently, Starbucks hired two former Taco Bell executives to help lead changes in store operations and customer service. The company is also cutting its menu by 30% and removing the up charge for non-dairy milks, which have grown in popularity among customers. With a mediator now in the mix, both sides aim to resolve their differences while finding common ground. Similarly to Starbucks, workers at Costco (COST+0.11%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.17%) have pushed for better pay and benefits, with the latter striking. At Costco, a strike is looming, despite the retailer’s wage boost offer. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Top Specialty PR Firms in 2025
URL: https://observer.com/list/best-specialty-pr-firms-2025/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:00:51Z
Full Content:
In an era where perception is currency, specialty PR firms are the brokers of influence Why does specialty PR matter? Because in an economy driven by perception, those who control the narrative control the market. And in a country where culture and commerce are inextricably linked, they don’t just shape industries—they shape the world we live in. Specialty PR firms shape what people see, hear and believe. On a micro level, they dictate which restaurants are impossible to book, which hotels are suddenly the destination and which films, albums and IPOs dominate cultural and financial conversations. On a macro level, they steer industries, influence policy narratives and define what matters in public discourse. In an era where perception is indistinguishable from reality, these PR firms don’t manage visibility but manufacture it. Specialty firms operate with precision. They don’t waste time trying to make a finance executive “relatable” or an indie musician “mainstream.” They know exactly where influence lives and how to embed clients within the conversations that matter. A hospitality PR firm doesn’t just push a hotel—it builds mythology around it. A tech PR firm doesn’t just announce funding rounds—it positions a company as an innovator before the market even realizes it’s relevant. And this matters to everyone. The stories people engage with, the trends they adopt, the brands they trust—these aren’t accidents. Specialty PR firms ensure that what rises above the noise isn’t what’s loudest but what’s designed to dominate. In a world oversaturated with content, they filter. For better or worse, they decide what gets remembered. Looking into 2025, these are the best specialty PR firms in the categories that matter most to Observer. Nightlife and dining PR engineers desire. It’s the whisper campaign that turns a tucked-away speakeasy into a celebrity haunt, the strategic leaks that make a restaurant impossible to book before it even opens and the viral moment so perfectly executed that the cocktails are practically copyrighted. It’s knowing which influencers to plant near the DJ, which critics to invite (or mysteriously forget), how to position a new tasting menu as the next gastronomic revolution and how to spin a kitchen meltdown into “an off-night” rather than a full-blown disaster. Whether launching a buzzy rooftop lounge, securing a Michelin nod or keeping a legacy institution relevant in a fickle industry, PR defines the scene itself. In nightlife and dining, perception is currency. “Creativity drives success." — Co-Founder Eva Karagiorgas It’s been a delicious year for Ilana Alperstein and Eva Karagiorgas’ ten-year-old PR firm. In 2024, Mona Creative added nearly 100 new clients and saw 35 percent year-on-year growth, an impressive feat in an industry where trends move at the speed of a viral TikTok. Named agency of record for the iconic estiatorio Milos brand worldwide, the firm also won celebrated clients like H&H Bagels, Dominique Ansel Bakery and Acru from NA:EUN Hospitality―the team behind Atomix, hailed widely as one of the world’s best restaurants. Mona was at the center of the year’s most high-profile restaurant stories, overseeing the openings of Catch Hospitality's The Corner Store and Tao Group's Crane Club. Mona handled PR for two additions to Miami’s Design District: Nami Nori’s December expansion and the forthcoming opening of Matsuyoi. The agency remains deeply embedded in David Chang’s Momofuku empire, including his social media-famous Majordōmo in Los Angeles, which had a wildly successful NYC pop-up last year. They’re also behind the much-anticipated Kabawa and Bar Kabawa, opening in February in the former Ko Bar space, featuring a prix-fixe menu helmed by Paul Carmichael, Momofuku’s head of culinary development. Beyond restaurants, Mona’s influence extends across food media and publishing. They represent James Beard-winning cookbook author and TV personality Hawa Hassan, whose Vogue-covered wedding in April 2024 was as much a media event as a personal milestone. They also repped the March launch of two-time James Beard and Webby Award-winning Sporkful host Dan Pashman's first book, Anything’s Pastable. monacreative.co “Integrity is our north star. Telling things the way they are is always the best approach.” — Founder Hanna Lee Hanna Lee Communications dominated the hospitality PR game in 2024, with some of the year’s biggest dining and spirits stories tracing back to its team. Café Carmellini by Andrew Carmellini and Ghee Indian Kitchen by Niven Patel and Mohamed Alkassar both landed coveted James Beard Award semifinalist nods, a testament to HLC’s knack for positioning clients at the center of industry acclaim. The firm continued its streak of high-impact launches, including the new Locanda Verde at Hudson Yards, The Portrait Bar and a slate of top-tier venues spanning New York, Miami and beyond. Celebrating 21 years, Hanna Lee's global reach now extends from New York to Nairobi, championing brands that shape the future of hospitality, from luxury hotels to world-class bars, spirits brands and distilleries. The firm's PR playbook doesn’t just generate headlines—it crafts legacy. That strategy paid off with two PRNews Platinum Awards: Best Restaurant/F&B Campaign for Woody Creek Distillers’ William H. Macy Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey and Best Podcast for Hospitality Forward, now heading into its seventh season. Beyond press, HLC continues to invest in the industry’s future. HLC Meet the Media champions journalism’s evolving landscape, while New York Bartender Week—returning in November 2025—spotlights bartending as both an art form and economic force. hannaleecommunications.com “I encourage everyone on the team to know what the media writes, how they write and who they write for.” — Founder Steven Hall Attending an industry event with Steven Hall is like touring a city with its mayor. After nearly 30 years, Hall PR remains the gold standard for those seeking the spotlight in nightlife and dining, and the founder's stature as an industry guru continues to draw established and emerging clients. Operating as both a power broker and cultural translator, 2024 was a banner year for the firm, marked by a slew of high-profile openings, milestone anniversaries and the kind of deep-rooted industry relationships that make Hall PR an enduring force. Legacy clients Carmine’s and Virgil’s celebrated 35 and 30 years, respectively, while Simon Oren’s Chef Driven Group—Hall PR’s very first client—continued its expansion with Acadia and Sempre Oggi. Aquavit hit the decade mark of holding two Michelin stars, and Chef Vijay Kumar of Semma was named a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef NYS. Hall PR opened Wayward Fare in Prospect Heights with Akhtar Nawab and debuted Mango Bay, an Afro-Caribbean hotspot helmed by rising star Chef London Chase. Hall opened Cesar, Chef Cesar Ramirez’s two-Michelin-star restaurant; YongChuan, the Sichuan/Ningbo Chinese spot; Lungi, a Sri Lankan/Southern Indian eatery; and Medium Rare, a steak-frites brand from D.C. Already this year, Hall opened Chez Fifi from Sushi Noz owners David and Josh Foulquier, which swiftly became one of Manhattan's most sought-after reservations. Another Hall PR client, The Bronze Owl, was instantly dubbed “Manhattan’s hottest new cocktail bar.” The firm also oversaw the debut of Nōksu, a fine-dining enclave hidden beneath the 32nd Street subway station, where grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce is redefining underground luxury. Expanding its global influence, Hall PR signed on with Japanese food brand Kayanoya while continuing to broker licensing deals for Tokyo’s Garde properties, bringing Japanese brands stateside and vice versa. And in Harlem, Melba Wilson’s unstoppable empire is now part of the Hall PR family. hallpr.com "A company’s growth is directly tied to making people feel valued and dedicating time to cultivating strong leaders. When you invest in capable, forward-thinking leaders, you ignite a culture of innovation, accountability and unstoppable passion." — Founder Rachel Harrison In 2024, Rachel Harrison's eponymous PR agency secured Michelin Keys for Eastwind Hotel & Bar, NoMad London, Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection and Crossroads while positioning Chef Dominique Crenn as a media sensation with placements in Bon Appétit and Cherry Bombe. The firm’s strategic storytelling landed Thailand as the filming location for The White Lotus season three, generating over 3 billion media impressions. In nightlife, RHC launched venues like Ànimo! and Revelie and signed legendary NYC institution Raoul's ahead of its 50th anniversary. RHC further solidified its industry impact with the "Manhattan Manhattan" campaign for Great Jones Distilling Co. and its comms strategy to ensure Superbueno was ranked #27 on the World's 50 Best Bars list (and #2 on North America's 50 Best Bars). "We’ve been leveling up year after year," Harrison says to Observer of the culture she's built. "Our low turnover allows us to continuously nurture and train a team of smart, dynamic and wildly creative professionals. Watching this team evolve into some of the most talented, visionary creatives I’ve ever worked with is something I’m immensely proud of—and it’s exactly what fuels our success." At the tail end of 2024, RHC brought on notable bars, including award-winning Sip & Guzzle and Press Club in Washington D.C. Blending trend-savvy editorial perspectives with strategic media outreach, RHC continues to shape the conversation in dining and nightlife. wearerhc.com “There will always be an arsenal of PR tactics to deploy, but those aren’t the campaigns you phone home about.” — Founder Gia Vecchio Foxglove has always punched above its weight in nightlife and dining PR, but 2024 was the year it leveled up in every direction. Gia Vecchio’s seven-year-old firm—which maintains a long and ever-growing client list of restaurants, chefs, bakeries, books and indie hotels—doubled its team, adding NYC industry heavyweight Liza Prijatel Thors (formerly of The Door) as vice president. It also expanded operations to Texas, picking up an award-winning roster of restaurants across Dallas, Houston and Austin. The firm’s expertise now extends far beyond restaurants, securing OpenTable as a major client and becoming the agency of record for food and beverage at Wynn hotels. Meanwhile, Foxglove’s influence in the luxury hospitality space continues to grow, snagging Cape & Kantary Thailand—two luxury, five-star properties—and taking on two of celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's restaurants within his Mid-Atlantic expansion. Foxglove also deepened its authority in beverage and craft cocktails, signing Lunazul Tequila under the Heaven Hill portfolio and top-tier bar groups from Dear Irving to Experimental Group. The stately flower may have elegant spikes, but in the PR game, Vecchio's Foxglove is proving itself just as sharp. Foxglove isn’t slowing down in 2025, stacking high-profile wins that further cement its dominance in hospitality. The firm is leading the charge for Wonder’s ambitious Mid-Atlantic expansion, working to position the on-demand dining disruptor as a category-defining brand. In the spirits world, Foxglove has signed on with Cooper Spirits, handling several of its most esteemed labels, including Slow & Low. Meanwhile, the firm is bringing the adrenaline-fueled luxury of F1 Arcade to Philadelphia, ensuring the immersive racing experience makes a splash in a city primed for high-energy entertainment. Proving its track record in the industry’s upper echelon, Foxglove played a pivotal role in eight campaigns for 2025 James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and chefs, turning culinary excellence into headline-making moments. foxglovecommunications.com Luxury Travel PR sells fantasies. It’s the campaign that transforms a secluded island retreat into the next jet-set destination, the carefully placed feature that makes a $50,000-a-night safari lodge feel essential before the season’s bookings vanish and the media strategy that positions a heritage château as the discreet escape for power players. It’s securing glossy spreads, curating who gets invited to that ultra-exclusive press trip and ensuring the right whispers about a resort’s guest list make the rounds. Every detail—from the first embargoed preview to the last perfectly staged Instagram post—turns geo-tags into status symbols. In luxury travel, PR isn’t really about visibility but making sure the right people see it and everyone else wants to. “Empathy isn’t just a value—it’s a strength. When people feel cared for, solutions often follow naturally.” — Account Manager Ashley Mir Imagine PR had a powerhouse 2024, expanding its global footprint with a roster that reads like a high-end travel wishlist. Gabriele and Andreas Sappok's firm added Walk Japan, the country’s premier walking tour operator, and eriro, an ultra-luxe Austrian Alps retreat reachable only by cable car. Austria’s Forsthofgut, famed for its sprawling mountain spa, and Portugal’s W Algarve, home to a mix of luxury suites and residences, further cemented Imagine’s reputation for representing exclusive hospitality. The firm’s expansion into Africa included Stanley Safaris, a boutique operator crafting bespoke journeys across the continent and South Africa’s highly anticipated Spier Hotel, set to open in 2025 with a village-style design in the Cape Winelands. Switzerland’s legendary Tschuggen Collection and Iceland’s Sky Lagoon, with its newly opened Turf House inspired by Viking architecture, rounded out Imagine’s deepening influence in experiential luxury. In Florence, Imagine took on the historic Hotel Brunelleschi, built within the city’s oldest standing tower, while also securing The Broadway Collection as a client. But the year’s biggest coup? MJ The Musical—its first standalone show, with a global PR strategy positioning it as an essential NYC travel experience. For a firm that has long blended travel with cultural cachet, 2024 was the year Imagine PR proved that high-end hospitality and world-class entertainment belong in the same conversation. imagine-team.com Gizem Ozcelik continues to parlay out-of-the-park creativity with an intensive media strategy to produce game-changing client results. That approach is what led hospitality disruptor Generator and Freehand Hotels to seek the agency for representation across their portfolio and their foray into third-party management with the opening of the iconic Paramount Hotel in Times Square, focusing on boosting the profiles of brand leadership. GO PR will also spearhead Generator's 30th-anniversary efforts in 2025. Ozcelik has been working with the brand since 2016, helping to single-handedly change the perception of the hotel market in the U.S. and set the stage for the Freehand acquisition. In 2024, GO PR also expanded its wellness business, winning Naturopathica spas, tasked to to double the brand’s footprint in 2025 with openings in Aspen and Phoenix, as well as the Ballers social-sports brand from former Fitler Club Founders. The agency continues to add to its tentpole of boutique hotel launches; for the debut of Philadelphia’s indie Hotel Anna & Bel, GO PR secured over six billion impressions spanning 200 hits, Ozcelik tells Observer. go-pr.com “Sometimes the most creative ideas may not deliver immediate results, but will support the long-term goals." — Founder Melanie Brandman Melanie Brandman's eponymous PR agency hit its highest revenue in history last year, a feat that’s particularly impressive considering the hospitality industry’s post-pandemic reckoning. Along with a long list of stalwart accounts like COMO Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton properties, The Brandman Agency had a string of powerhouse wins in 2024, including the Peninsula Hotels’ global portfolio and IHG’s Luxury and Lifestyle brands (Six Senses). Brandman also unveiled Carlton Cannes, a Regent Hotel, with a major activation at the Cannes Film Festival. The agency orchestrated La Mamounia’s 100th-anniversary celebration, transforming the Moroccan landmark into a media magnet, drawing coverage in Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and The Financial Times with over 54 million impressions. More than 35 percent of Brandman's clients have been with the agency for six years or more, including La Mamounia (16 years), Rome Cavalieri and Raffles Singapore (8 years each) and Experience Scottsdale (12 years). The Peninsula New York’s refurbishment campaign—complete with an exclusive Vogue100 rooftop event—showcases how Brandman curates moments that redefine brands. brandmanagency.com "My senior team appreciated me walking away, knowing we would get better business instead. That's the advantage of owning my own agency and being smart about the long game in PR.” — Founder Laura Davidson In an industry where client loyalty is rare, Laura Davidson Public Relations (LDPR) has built nearly 25 years of staying power. The firm has held onto Abercrombie & Kent, Paws Up in Montana and VisitScotland for almost 20 years and the Aman for 10. In just last year, LDPR added Park Hyatt New York, Windstar Cruises and Orient Express Italy, Melbourne/Visit Victoria, Andaz Miami Beach, NYC’s Sonesta Hotels, Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, the Grand Hotel Fasano in Lake Garda Italy and Sundance, Utah. Speaking with Observer, Laura Davidson stresses the importance of not chasing every opportunity but cultivating the right ones. The firm's refusal to take on business that treats agencies as vendors rather than partners has only strengthened its culture. The result? A record $4.5 million in revenue for 2024, with projections to hit $5 million in 2025. Beyond traditional tactics, LDPR has mastered the art of viral activations, from VisitScotland’s Coo Cam, a live feed of Highland cows, to Paws Up Resort’s partnership with Fender, blending luxury travel with music. Campaigns like the “Election Recovery Package” for O2 Beach Club in Barbados drive bookings while keeping the narrative fresh. ldpr.com "As we evolve, we are increasingly drawn to brands that embody an entrepreneurial spirit—those that ignite and embrace creativity while having the ability to transform ideas into action. Focusing our work on clients that are agile and collaborative allows our agency to do what we do best and bring to life original, creative and thoughtful ideas that make an impact for our clients." — Founder Meg Connolly Meg Connolly Communications (MCC) has long set the bar in luxury travel PR, and 2024 only reinforced its dominance. This year’s new wins read like a curated itinerary of the world’s most coveted destinations: Meadowood Napa Valley, The Marbella Club and three Auberge Resorts Collection properties, including The Dunlin, Primland and the highly anticipated Collegio alla Querce in Florence. The firm’s deep relationships are as much a calling card as its press coups. Longtime clients like Maybourne, The St. Regis New York and Pulitzer Amsterdam showcase MCC’s ability to retain the industry’s top names, while its campaigns—like the Vogue feature on the ultra-luxe private island escape, Islas Secas and The Dunlin’s buzzy debut—prove its mastery of cultural cachet. MCC’s deep network ensures launches land in all the right places, from Wes Gordon and Indre Rockefeller’s social feeds to the pages of Condé Nast Traveler. MCC has also made bold moves, walking away from corporate hospitality in favor of more entrepreneurial, creatively driven brands. “We are intentional about who we work with, even at the risk of growth,” Connolly tells Observer. The result? A client roster defined by prestige, impact and longevity. mcc-pr.com Entertainment PR keeps the right names in the headlines and the wrong ones buried in legal memos. It’s crafting Oscar campaigns that turn solid performances into “career-defining,” feeding blind items to DeuxMoi to keep a star relevant and ensuring that a flopped album or box office disaster somehow gets framed as “ahead of its time.” It’s the whisper network that decides which actor gets the GQ cover and which gets quietly sunset, and the media rollout transforms a niche indie musician into a pop culture force. It's turning a debut album into a cultural moment and a limited theater run into a must-see event. From stadium tours to arthouse films and red carpet premieres to sold-out residencies, entertainment PR is about influence, positioning talent and productions at the center of the cultural zeitgeist. "If you can’t picture it, don’t pitch it. If you can’t visualize an artist on a cover or a show, don’t waste anyone's time." — Founder Steve Martin Nasty Little Man founder Steve Martin’s deft handling of Dave Grohl’s latest headline was hailed by The New York Times as "a lesson in crisis control"—though at this point, navigating the rock PR high-wire is just business as usual. The firm’s latest run of campaigns reads like a masterclass in cultural impact: Paul McCartney’s Eyes of the Storm photography exhibition made its U.S. debut to rapturous press; Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us dominated the indie conversation; and St. Vincent’s All Born Screaming landed her a WNBA national anthem performance—a first, even for Martin, who’s been at this game for a while. Of course, loyalty is the real currency in rock and roll, and Martin’s client roster proves it. Beastie Boys (31 years), Foo Fighters (29 years), Radiohead (24 years), Arcade Fire (17 years) and LCD Soundsystem (16 years) still trust Nasty to keep them at the forefront. Metallica, another longtime client, isn’t just selling out stadiums but shaping real-world change through All Within My Hands, the band’s philanthropic foundation. Now in its sixth year, the Metallica Scholars Initiative has grown from 10 schools to 60, spanning all 50 states and Guam, pumping $10 million into workforce education, disaster relief and food insecurity initiatives—because nothing screams rock and roll like actually making a difference. nastylittleman.com "Working in theater is a gift. Not only is creativity appreciated, it’s expected." — Co-Founder Molly Barnett Molly Barnett and Chelsea Nachman’s theater-PR firm scored Broadway’s biggest coup with Oh, Mary!, a huge and unlikely sensation that theater critic David Cote dubbed "a splendidly nasty farce you will not want to miss." Grapevine Public Relations also reps long-running hit & Juliet, the only new musical of the 2022-23 Broadway season that recouped; highly anticipated new Idina Menzel vehicle Redwood; Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, who made her Broadway debut as composer of The Notebook; Cyndi Lauper, for all her theater projects; and playwright Theresa Rebeck, Lauper’s collaborator on next year’s Working Girl. Theater photographer Jenny Anderson is among Grapevine's newest clients; her book, The In-Between, will be released in April. Barnett tells Observer that 2024 was the firm's best year ever, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Amanda Marie Miller, who joined Barnett and Nachman in 2023, turning it into a three-person firm, tells Observer she's thrilled to work alongside the best in the business. "Grapevine puts an immense amount of energy and care into each client," Miller says. "It is an honor to work with such outstanding partners." grapevineprny.com "We see pressure as an opportunity to do our best work." — Founder Sheila Feren Thurston This insider’s insider entertainment PR firm, founded by longtime publicist Sheila Feren Thurston, just marked its 30th anniversary. The agency reps marquee brands, including Amazon’s Prime Video, AMC Networks, Disney Entertainment Television, Audible, TBS, Hulu and STARZ. Feren and her team have had a hand in launching shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead Universe, along with recent hits like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Palm Royale and Slow Horses. AMC Networks has been a client for two decades, too. For Project Healthy Minds, whose mission is to destigmatize the topic of mental health, FerenComm veered from its entertainment roots to handle the non-profit’s annual New York gala and World Mental Health Day Festival in October. ferencomm.com "Crisis is an opportunity to live your values and demonstrate what you truly stand for." — Co-CEOs Amanda Silverman, Christine Su, Meredith O'Sullivan & Sarah Rothman Veterans of Observer’s PR Power List, this celebrity and entertainment heavyweight gained more star power in 2024. In November, The Lede Company opened a Nashville office to house its new music division, whose clients include Sabrina Carpenter, Post Malone, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, Rosalia, Shakira and A$AP Rocky. Co-founders Sarah Rothman, Amanda Silverman, Meredith O'Sullivan and Christine Su are growing the company's London office with an eye on even bigger European business. The agency’s new events practice will expand on Lede's work for clients like Louis Vuitton, Thom Browne and Coach. Hennessy grew its mandate with The Lede Company for comms, talent partnerships, influencer marketing and social. Among 2024’s big hires: Lede’s Chief Impact Officer Jackie Murphy, formerly Edelman’s managing director of brand, purpose and impact. Oh, and its ongoing clients include Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldana, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The company continues to represent corporate and brand clients such as Audi, YouTube, Paramount and The North Face. As a strategic partner to Comcast NBCUniversal, Lede worked closely with them on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. ledecompany.com "Genuine enthusiasm and passion are a critical priority when advocating for our projects. We also care about balancing our relationships with respect, trust, compassion…and a sense of humor is essential." — Founder Matt Polk It’s been an award-winning year for Matt Polk’s mighty theater-PR agency; with 26 competitive Tony Awards in 2024, Polk & Co clients won 12, or nearly half the awards bestowed. The firm’s clients also earned a total of 62 Tony Award nominations, including some categories with multiple nominees. Along the way, Polk and Co signed marquee clients, including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, co-produced by Netflix and Sonia Friedman; Alicia Keys’ Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen; the stage adaptation of Prince’s Purple Rain; and Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures’ Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Hollywood’s Jon M. Chu. And its campaigns for blockbuster shows, including Gypsy (“A once-in-a-lifetime event! Top-to-bottom perfect”), Maybe Happy Ending ("the best, most beautiful, innovational and original musical"), Death Becomes Her (“Savagely funny. Wildly entertaining. A virtually perfect musical comedy") and the Merrily We Roll Along revival, have helped win both headlines and critical ovations. polkandco.com “Analytics matter less to us than bringing culture-shifting art to a bigger audience in new ways. If a story is seen or read by only 100 people but it’s the right 100 influential people, that can cause a ripple effect and build a brand with a stronger foundation.” — Partner Dana Meyerson Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza performance shattered records this summer, drawing the largest day crowd in the festival’s 30-plus-year history—a feat Billboard hailed while naming her the fourth-biggest star of the year. It’s a massive win for the artist but also for Biz 3, the PR agency led by founder Kathryn Frazier and partner Dana Meyerson, who have been guiding Roan’s rise since 2022. 2024 wasn’t just about Roan. Biz 3 delivered headline moments for breakout artists like Victoria Monet, Jorja Smith, Jessie Reyez, Caroline Polachek, Sudan Archives, Tommy Richman, TOKiMONSTA, Yves Tumor, Robert Glasper, Daniel Nigro and Remi Wolf, while continuing to shepherd superstars such as the weeknd, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Daft Punk, Skrillex, Justice and Killer Mike. Singer-songwriter RAYE, a client since 2023, made history by becoming the first artist to take home six Brit Awards in a single night. Three 2025 Grammy nominations make RAYE the first artist in history to be simultaneously nominated for both Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year—plus Best Engineered Album, for engineering Lucky Daye's Algorithm. Although the year is young, Biz 3 has already welcomed Leon Thomas, Jensen McRae, Nemahsis, Quadeca, Scowl, Hi-Tech, Spill Tab, Avalon, Saint Levant, Elyanna and Dora Jar. biz3.net New Tech PR sells the future—whether or not it actually works. It’s the breathless product launch that makes a marginal software update sound revolutionary, the keynote speech that convinces investors a PowerPoint prototype is worth billions and the embargoed “leak” that sends preorders through the roof. It’s about keeping founders mythologized, venture rounds oversubscribed and regulatory scrutiny at bay. When innovation turns to scandal—think mass layoffs, privacy breaches or vaporware exposés—it’s the pivot to “lessons learned” and a LinkedIn essay on leadership. In tech PR, hype isn’t just a tool—it’s the entire business model. Whether broadcasting the latest A.I. breakthrough, keeping B2B SaaS from sounding like a spreadsheet factory or ensuring regulators stay just confused enough. This is PR at its most strategic—because in enterprise, perception is revenue. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." — Co-Founders Greg Mondshein & Becky Honeyman For Greg Mondshein and Becky Honeyman’s eight-year-old SourceCode Communications, winning clients like Writer, Sonatype, Sovos, Vultr, Scribd and a Fortune 10 technology company was the icing on the cake for 2024. The firm’s first GrowthSource event drew attendees who were able to network with peers and build a small community of NYC marketers to lean on during a time when the industry is constantly shifting. Their first-ever Global Executive Leadership team was established with UK Managing Director Giles Peddy, EVP Head of Client Services Christa Conte and EVP Head of Technology and Innovation Kevin Dulaney. "We never envisaged building an industry coalition but having worked in an industry that sees fewer minority and female leaders and founders, we wanted to try to mitigate this disparity," Mondshein and Honeyman tell Observer of The Diversity Marketing Consortium, a coalition of four marketing agencies that have pledged millions in pro-bono comms, marketing and design services to support diverse founders, in partnership with Harlem Capital Partners. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." SourceCode’s revenue was up 15 percent last year with 30 percent organic growth thanks to the work of the recently promoted U.S. Managing Director Kristen Stippich. SourceCode has been recognized with 21 industry awards, became B Corp certified, launched a new website, expanded its service offerings with multiple new products and continues to see growth in its London office with an expanding team. All in all, SourceCode is ready to take the bull by the horns in 2025. sourcecodecommunications.com "Time and time again, we see acts of honesty pay off by leaps and bounds. There’s no need to concoct smear campaigns and cover-ups a la Justin Baldoni—just own up to what you’ve done and share how you’re going to be better." — Founder Bruno Solari Leading-edge companies that bridge tech and healthcare are among the change-making clients at Bruno Solari’s two-year-old shop. They include Suki, which provides A.I. voice solutions for healthcare; Avandra, the largest federated network for de-identified medical image data; Tuva Health, the world's first open-source healthcare data transformation platform; and virtual nutrition-counseling startup Culina Health. Big consumer brands are also on the roster; SolComms handled Apothékary’s Ulta.com launch and Shiseido investment; sustainable cleaning brand Blueland’s Pods are Plastic launch, where the brand supported the introduction of a bill to ban the sale of detergent pods in New York City; and the viral bag brand Bogg’s entrance at Target. Growing in corporate communications, the firm partnered with Daniel Lubetzky, the billionaire KIND Snacks founder, to announce him as the newest Shark on Shark Tank. In 2024, SolComms further established its leadership team, elevating Isabella Morreale to Associate Vice President of HealthTech, Kylee Kaetzel to Associate Vice President of Consumer, Elizabeth Snyder to Director of Digital Health and Natalie Valicenti to Director of Operations. For this 30-person firm, 2025 is all about vertical growth. The agency recently signed a slew of big tech and A.I. companies outside of healthcare. It also built a robust creator marketing team, offering consumer brands earned and paid influencer campaigns, as well as paid podcast and newsletter partnerships. "We’re human-first in everything we do," Solari tells Observer. "More times than not, the client is choosing the people—not the capabilities or experience. Our clients view us as counselors, strategic thought partners, and at times, even therapists—and I’m so proud of that." solcomms.co "Agility means never changing the goal, but always being willing to shift the strategy." — Founder & CEO Tiffany Guarnaccia Adtech, retail media, climate tech and A.I.-powered businesses are the categories driving incredible growth at Tiffany Guarnaccia’s 12-year-old agency. Among last year's achievements was the rebrand and relaunch of Caddis, a global advisory firm specializing in the development of data centers to house A.I. infrastructure and working with Salesforce Ventures-backed startups like AutogenAI, a bid-writing tool that's been dubbed one of the U.K.'s most promising new artificial intelligence companies. In 2024, Kite Hill PR helped The Home Depot rebrand its retail media division to Orange Apron Media, in an upfronts-style event showcasing its new offerings. In the very hot climate-tech space, Kite Hill represents players such as Proteus Ocean Group, a company spearheading the creation of a first-of-its-kind underwater space station off the coast of Curaçao. "PROTEUS" will advance marine science, climate research and ocean exploration through long-term habitation, state-of-the-art labs and live-streamed educational programming in partnership. Sapphire Technologies, a leader in energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas, is another Kite Hill Client. Last year, Sapphire Technologies entered the Nigerian market through a partnership with Horizon Shores Nigeria Ltd., deploying turboexpander technology to convert wasted pressure energy into clean electricity—marking its first African venture and a step toward advancing Nigeria’s sustainable energy transition. "We value agility," Guarnaccia tells Observer. "Which means earned media isn't always our primary focus." kitehillpr.com "The elite independent creative agencies producing game-changing work that wins coveted Cannes Lions lack the financial resources to stand out amidst lavish displays. This irony was not lost on our clients, who became increasingly vocal about this under-representation." — Co-Founders Hollie Rapello & Matt Van Hoven Raven Public Relations’ niche is PR for advertising agencies, which means the firm’s work also touches scores of big client brands―think Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Diageo, Molson Coors, Lenovo and many more. Raven spotlighted Arnold’s work for Progressive, earning its “Dr. Rick” campaign huge media attention. For Tombras, Raven helped publicize BarkAir, the dog airline created for Tombras client Bark. Raven served as an official partner of Cannes Lions, launching Indie Beach—an event that brought together 13 competitive agencies in a hallmark moment for the creative industry. "There are a number of principles guiding our business (resilience, empathy, rigor, pragmatism, integrity, innovation, etc.), but the one we feel has helped us more than any other is autonomy," fo-founders Hollie Rapello and Matt Van Hoven tell Observer. "It’s the cornerstone of our business, and it truly shapes every aspect of it." With eight consecutive years of double-digit growth, Rapello and Van Hoven's PR firm now represents major creative agencies from four of the five global ad holding companies and the most renowned independents. And in the biggest moment of the year for advertisers, The Super Bowl, Raven clients will be well represented. ravenpublicrelations.com "Conventional wisdom says clients always come first, but we invert that by prioritizing the needs of reporters. By focusing on what the media values, we ultimately serve the needs of our clients most effectively." — President Evan Strome High10 closed out 2024 on a high note, adding Bloomberg Media and Hearst to an already heavyweight roster of current and former media clients that includes The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, The Hill, Ad Age, Adweek, Billboard, The Economist, HuffPo, Grist, The New Republic, New York Daily News, Telemundo, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Finance and The Wrap. The firm also delivered standout results for Aspen Digital, a nonpartisan program of the Aspen Institute and Kelvin, a climate-tech startup. 2025 marks High10's 15th year, and the agency's influence shows no signs of slowing under CEO Lisa Dallos and President Evan Strome. At Web Summit in November, High10 client and CEO of Klaris IP Ed Klaris tackled the battle between A.I. and intellectual property in a conversation with The Guardian's Dan Milmo, while The Ankler's Janice Min—let’s be honest, it's Min’s Ankler—joined Axios’ Sara Fisher and Lucy Blakiston of Shit You Should Care About to dissect the ever-mutating media landscape. "Every client has the potential to operate as a media company," Dallos tells Observer. "Everything we do is rooted in building authentic connections, respecting the editorial process, and understanding what makes a good story." With a client list that reads like a who's who of media and a knack for steering the conversation in all the right rooms, High10 is setting the stage for the next big chapter. high10media.com Financial Services PR is less about explaining numbers than making them feel inevitable. It’s the carefully crafted earnings call that turns “significant losses” into “strategic recalibration,” the jargon-laden press release that ensures no one actually understands why a stock tanked and the analyst whisper campaign that transforms a floundering fintech into “the next great disruptor.” It’s about keeping CEOs on CNBC when things are good and off the front page when they’re not. Whether it's hyping a blockbuster IPO, massaging a bank failure or making hedge funds sound less like casinos, financial PR is high-stakes storytelling—because perception, in this business, is value. "We frequently advise our clients that they do not have a PR challenge; they have a business challenge. When the delta between business reality and rhetoric widens, so too does reputational risk." — Partner & New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley Brunswick continues to lead M&A communications worldwide. In 2024, the firm worked on 295 transactions globally worth a total of $583 billion, including 26 publicly disclosed activist defense engagements with an aggregate market cap of $583 billion. High-profile engagements last year included advising the Special Committee of Paramount on its $8.4 billion sale to Skydance Media and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor on its $10 billion sale to Silver Lake. Henry Timms, former President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, joined Brunswick this summer as group CEO based in New York alongside Nik Deogun (CEO of the Americas) and Jonathan Doorley (New York office head). On the West Coast, Mohamed Younis, formerly Gallup’s editor-in-chief, joined as Global Head of Insight; and Christine Schirmer, ex-Pinterest and Apple, joined to expand technology sector expertise. “Sir Alan Parker, our Chairman, frequently reminds us to ‘never get between the client and the footlights.’ This quote perfectly summarizes our firm’s deep commitment to client service but also our culture of discretion," Partner and New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley tells Observer. "We also frequently refer to the “One-firm, firm”—it is a core part of our culture." Brunswick continues to deepen its D.C. presence on both sides of the aisle with the recent additions of Jim Bognet, a Republican campaign manager and former Congressional candidate and Kate Bedingfield, President Biden’s former White House Communications Director. brunswickgroup.com “We provide direct, unvarnished counsel, no matter the client, context, or audience." — Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter In 2024, Gasthalter advised on some of the most complex and high-stakes situations while continuing to support the profile-raising efforts of its global client base. This now 30+-person boutique agency supported clients across investment management, digital assets and blockchain, A.I. and compute, venture capital, real estate and others on reputation management and profile-raising campaigns. Further, the firm advised on significant M&A and other transactions, proxy contests, litigation support, regulatory investigations and management succession matters. Gasthalter ranked #2 in Bloomberg’s 2024 Global Activism League Tables, advising a range of clients, including Mantle Ridge in its campaign against Air Products and Chemicals, Barington Capital Group in its campaign against Macy’s and Jana Partners in its campaign against Lamb Weston, among others. "The question we constantly ask ourselves is whether we are able to achieve maximum impact," Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter tells Observer. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and that is how we train our people.” gasthalter.com "We’re firm about never lying to or trying to spin a journalist, and if a potential client’s values don’t align with ours, we’ll walk away. We always try to understand the pressures others face and where they’re coming from. This may sound corny or trite, but it's key to our business and success." — Founder Richard Dukas In a landscape where many agencies focus on keeping clients out of the headlines, Dukas Linden (DLPR) ensures they own them. Over the past year, the firm has expanded its blue-chip roster, securing as well as growing major accounts with Raymond James, Citizens Bank, Neuberger Berman and Evercore, while the firm’s growing partnership with the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN) underscores its commitment to shaping financial industry narratives. DLPR works closely with PEWIN leadership to elevate the organization’s visibility and provide strategic communications training for female executives in private equity, venture capital and private credit. DLPR’s longstanding relationships speak volumes: It has helped steer Neuberger Berman’s public perception for seven years, transforming its reputation from a wealth manager to a diversified asset giant with $450 billion in AUM. The firm also manages the high-profile communications strategy for ARK-Invest, ensuring Cathie Wood’s innovation-focused firm remains dominant in market conversations while mitigating brand misconceptions. Additionally, DLPR has led messaging for Raymond James Investment Management, seamlessly integrating corporate rebranding into media, executive positioning and thought leadership initiatives. "We faced an unusual challenge when Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC," Executive Vice President Stephanie Dressler tells Observer, reflecting on how the firm approached one of the most unique challenges in the last year. "Several of our clients simultaneously launched funds, along with other, much larger firms, including BlackRock. Since DLPR creates dedicated teams for each client, we were able to implement differentiated launch strategies for each and avoid client conflicts." As a bonus, DLPR boasts a four-person executive management team with an average tenure of 13 years. Five other executives have been with the agency for an average of a decade, and five more have been at DLPR for an average of seven years, founder Richard Dukas tells Observer. dlpr.com "A company we worked with was navigating a Chapter 11 case and needed to announce going-out-of-business sales for many stores without creating the impression they were liquidating entirely. Instead of sticking to the usual playbook, we took a bold, proactive approach. We planned ahead, preparing the CEO to deliver the story. The message was clear: the company had a solid plan, real value and a future worth investing in. This narrative shifted perceptions and paved the way for a successful sale. Today, the company is thriving—a testament to the power of decisive leadership, creative storytelling, and rethinking traditional approaches." — Founder & CEO Jon Henes C Street Advisory Group, the boutique firm launched by Jon Henes in 2021, has rapidly become the go-to for companies navigating financial distress, reputation crises and political headwinds. In 2024 alone, the firm secured 40 new clients—including Bed Bath & Beyond, David’s Bridal, Ted Baker Canada, National CineMedia and Barnes & Noble Education—bringing its total to 67 new clients in just 24 months. The firm’s momentum earned it Communications Firm of the Year from M&A Advisors and a top ranking from The Deal for its strategic work in Chapter 11 cases and out-of-court transactions. C Street also deepened its public affairs practice while expanding its footprint to include New York, Chicago and Toronto. "Creativity and results go together," Managing Director Luke Wolf tells Observer. "It’s not about being creative for its own sake but about driving meaningful, measurable outcomes." "Teamwork is in our DNA," Managing Director Whitney Fogelberg adds. With 16 new hires last year—including the addition of Michael Frishberg as President—C Street is scaling fast. And 2025 is already off to a strong start, with five new clients signed in January alone. For a firm built on discretion and high-stakes strategy, its rise has been anything but quiet. thecstreet.com Bad news in business is good for Kekst CNC, which this year handled high-profile situations like Franchise Group’s Chapter 11 filing―its brands included Vitamin Shoppe―as well as bankruptcy communications for Party City, True Value Hardware and others. It wasn’t all doom and gloom, though. Kekst oversaw comms for Landbridge’s IPO; shares in the energy-development company surged on their first day of trading. The firm also opened its first office in Saudi Arabia and developed an A.I. tool with Oxford University to analyze the impact of how executives speak. kekstcnc.com Crisis Reputation Management is the art of spinning disaster into a mere “unfortunate misunderstanding.” It’s about knowing when to deny, when to grovel and when to throw an intern under the bus (joking!). The right crisis team can turn a corporate meltdown into a “bold new direction,” a CEO’s scandal into a “deeply personal journey of growth,” and a brand boycott into a limited-edition marketing opportunity. It’s less about truth and more about timing—knowing which journalists will play ball, which headlines can be buried and when to pivot from “no comment” to a tearful redemption tour. "Our most unconventional approach? Working with the media rather than avoiding them." — Founding Partner Ed Hammond Just 18 months after its founding by an A-team of comms pros and a former journalist, Collected Strategies has served more than 100 clients, outperforming expectations despite a slow M&A market. Founding Partners Scott Bisang, Jim Golden, Jude Gorman, Nick Lamplough, Ed Hammond and Dan Moore recently hired the firm's 20th employee (senior CNBC producer Patrick Manning) and capped 2024 by ranking in the top five of Bloomberg’s IR/PR Advisers for U.S. companies facing shareholder activists and in the top 10 of The Deal M&A League Tables. Among recent headline-making assignments: Masonite’s $3.9 billion sale to Owens Corning, Cigna’s $3.7 billion sale of its Medicare Advantage business, Sekisui House’s $4.9 billion acquisition of MDC Holdings, HireRight’s go private to General Atlantic and Stone Point Capital for $1.7 billion and Ambrx’s $2 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. In the hostile M&A world, the firm counseled Vanda Pharmaceuticals and Teoxane. In activism, Collected Strategies worked with dozens of companies facing private and public pressure against top activists like Trian, Starboard Value and Elliott Management, and is currently helping Matthews International against Barington Capital in a proxy contest. In restructuring, they advised on the bankruptcies of Red Lobster, Curo Group Holdings Corp. and CareMax. "Relationship building is such an individual pursuit, but our general rule is to stay engaged and do it honestly," Lamplough tells Observer. "You'll get found out and burned out trying to fake it." The firm's ongoing strategic advisory work—managing crises, reputational challenges and raising company and executive profiles with investors and the media—features big names like Lucid, Pernod Ricard, Hershey’s, Affirm, RingCentral, Exact Sciences, Carter’s, Genuine Parts, Top Rank Boxing, Bluestone Equity Partners and Element Solutions. collectedstrategies.com "We 'leaned in' instead of 'leaning out,' as conventional crisis communications wisdom recommends. We crafted an open letter to guests, a transparent, social-first strategy that clarified the restructuring process, reassured loyal customers, and countered misconceptions about the brand’s future—all without traditional media engagement." — Founder & CEO Michael Kempner “We’re in a reputation economy and a state of permacrisis,” MikeWorldWide founder and CEO Michael Kempner tells Observer. Both have been good for this formidable independent firm in its 35th year. Among MWW’s developments in 2024: A burgeoning corporate reputation practice (whose clients, not surprisingly, insist on anonymity), proprietary developments in A.I., a soon-to-open Mexico City office and expansion in London. Ongoing clients include Deloitte Global, StubHub, Subaru and the International Council of Shopping Centers. So far in 2025, MWW has been named the agency of record for Mattress Firm, and its campaign for Red Lobsters's Chapter 11 filing was shortlisted in the PRWeek Awards for "Best in Crisis." Kempner credits starting with the fundamental audience questions ("Why should I trust you? Why do you matter to me?") is how MWW creates imaginative, purpose-driven campaigns. "Reputation is everything," Kempner tells Observer, stressing the firm's ultimate mission to be "trusted stewards internally for a culture of innovation and accountability." Among 2024’s hires: Former R&C PMK exec Alisa Granz as MWW’s head of brand, and Sarah Moloney joined as UK managing director from KWT Global. Kempner himself remains a key figure in Democratic politics; The New York Times cited him in a July story on Biden donors. mww.com “Almost every client relationship now includes a crisis plan." — Founder & CEO Amy RF|Binder With a team of 75, founder and CEO Amy RF|Binder’s firm may be smaller in size than some corporate agencies but has serious sway, guiding major clients through our bumpy business landscape. In 2024, RF|Binder marked a standout year with the acquisition purpose/sustainability agency Taft Communications and fintech-focused Peaks Strategies. Between continued industry accolades and a third consecutive Crain’s Best Places to Work nod, the firm also made a commitment to sustainability through 1% for the Planet, donating one percent of revenue to address urgent environmental issues. “Business can, and should, be a force for good," RF|Binder explained. "Business leaders and brands have the power and the responsibility to take on initiatives that improve society at large." RF|Binder tells Observer that the firm's proprietary "ClarityLens" has driven measurable results since its 2023 release. The strategic comms framework ensures RF|Binder is "aligning a client’s business and communications strategies, showcases the firm’s commitment to maximizing impact and delivering data-driven insights," Binder says. Binder also coined the term “controlled media”―a sharper term for what other firms call owned platforms. Business wins in 2024 include US Money Reserve, Yum China, Advocate Health, Flack Global Metals, QXO and USSA International, the U.S. subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. RF|Binder|Binder also keeps expanding relationships with key clients like Cargill, Fisher Investments, Welspun Living, Natixis Investment Managers, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Peachtree Group, Paris Baguette and Impax Asset Management. RF|Binder|Binder will mark its 25th anniversary in 2026. rfbinder.com “Working with a global restaurant company whose brand was widely seen as lagging, we got them to revitalize their product line and leapfrog their competitors with a truly dramatic, industry-leading ‘clean label’ commitment. This reinforced the importance of thinking big, having the courage of your convictions, and making sure your persuasion skills were on point.” – Founder & CEO Nick Kalm Reputation Partners founder Nick Kalm is such a high-profile figure in Chicago and D.C. that Politico wished him a happy birthday last year (it’s March 24), which he humbly and kindly downplays to Observer as, "not a big deal at all." Kalm's firm has developed a national reputation as one of the best, with more than 99 percent of all clients over the past 16 years recommending Reputation Partners for its expertise in corporate communications, issues management and client satisfaction. New clients for “special situations” and reputation management—confidential, of course—include a major automaker, a large consumer-goods company and one of the world’s largest retailers, Kalm tells Observer. New PR clients for the 22-year-old firm include event-management giant Encore, German manufacturing behemoth Guntner and California’s Lynx Logistics. The firm has counseled mall giant Simon Property Group, global restaurant group Darden, the Michigan Health System and Ingersoll-Rand. Internal and external comms around labor issues have long been a specialty. “At its core, our philosophy is a two-way 'no jerks' policy, for ourselves and for those we are supporting or interacting with," Executive Vice President and General Manager Andrew Moyer tells Observer. "You don’t need work to be a family, but you do need it to be a place people are excited to go to, and you need the team to be one people want to work with. Take care of the human connections, and the quality work will follow.” It should come as no surprise that, in 2024, Reputation Partners welcomed their sixth “boomerang” employee back to the company. reputationpartners.com "When the media reaches out, they know what guides us and that we will be honest, tenacious and reliable—just as we are for our clients." – Founder & CEO Risa Heller In 2024, Risa Heller Communications expanded westward, launching an LA office under the leadership of Netflix alum Erika Masonhall, a veteran of Facebook, NBC News and Sen. Joe Lieberman’s press operation. Other key hires include Julie Wood, former New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s Communications Director; Hazel Crampton-Hays, a press secretary to both Hochul and Andrew Cuomo; and Nate Evans, a former senior advisor to the U.S. UN Ambassador and Vice President Kamala Harris—bringing serious political muscle into the fold. Last year, RHC deepened its grip on tech, steering early-stage and pre-IPO companies across digital healthcare, fintech and Web3 through turbulence while continuing to represent industry giants facing regulatory heat like Airbnb, DoorDash and Match Group. Additionally, it continued to expand its client base across media, entertainment and sports. The firm also broadened its work with VCs, private equity leaders and investors on what it calls “sensitive and critical matters” for both the firms and their portfolio companies. The firm’s influence extends far beyond Silicon Valley, of course. RHC is the agency of record for New York’s most high-stakes real estate and civic issues, representing the likes of Howard Hughes, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Prologis and the Real Estate Board of New York. RHC’s PR expertise spans Vornado Realty Trust, Ken Griffin and Rudin's Park Avenue tower, the Met’s contemporary wing expansion and Silverstein Properties’ bid for a Manhattan casino—positioning the firm at the center of New York’s most transformative development and policy decisions. At the same time, the firm continued to represent prominent higher and lower education institutions as they navigated increased scrutiny related to the new federal landscape, contentious campus issues and high-profile stakeholders. And when it comes to labor disputes, RHC has established itself as the go-to operator, spearheading the U.S. Maritime Alliance’s response to a three-day union strike and managing other workplace issues with surgical precision. From Wall Street to Hollywood, from boardrooms to City Hall, RHC isn’t shaping conversations but deciding who gets to have them. risaheller.com Visual Arts PR is about myth-making. A well-placed profile can turn an emerging artist into a market darling overnight, while the right whisper campaign ensures a gallery’s latest wunderkind is suddenly “one to watch.” It’s the unseen hand shaping auction trends, museum acquisitions and which Instagram-friendly installations end up flooding your feed. From choreographing billion-dollar Basquiat sales to ensuring the right critics fawn over a mid-tier retrospective, PR in the art world is less about promotion and more about perception—because in this business, value isn’t just in the work but in the narrative. "When you work with clients for the long-term, success looks different year-on-year, and creativity comes from being nimble, responsive and by bringing people together to tell stories that matter." — President & Managing Director Jennifer Joy It’s been a busy year for this very plugged-in agency. New clients included Hong Kong Tourism Board, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, National Gallery of Athens, Sharjah Art Foundation, The Contemporary Austin, Skarstedt, Toledo Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Wellcome Trust—plus U.S. representation of Art Basel and the launch of Art Basel Paris in the Grand Palais. Two long-term museum clients celebrated milestone anniversaries, with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C. celebrating 50 years and The Bass in Miami Beach turning sixty. Sutton also launched the Little Village arts hub in Detroit, the inaugural Atlanta Art Fair and Widening the Lens: Photography, Ecology and the Contemporary Landscape, a podcast from Carnegie Museum of Art hosted by tennis champion, entrepreneur and arts advocate Venus Williams. Founded in London by Calum Sutton and led in the U.S. by President and Managing Director Jennifer Joy, Sutton also operates from Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong and Miami. Over the past year, Sutton has promoted Allison Thorpe to Senior Vice President and also hired freelance writer and essayist Shaquille Heath as an Account Director. "Creativity is our compass," Thorpe tells Observer. "We’re all about big ideas and connecting through culture to inspire not just our clients but also our team. We know how to mix work with a good time; fun fuels us. But make no mistake: we’re pros at delivering. This defines our culture and keeps our relationships thriving." suttoncomms.com "I like to walk a mile in a client's shoes. We curate exhibitions. We publish books. We organize lectures, and sometimes we give them. We throw parties just because. You can’t relate to creatives if you don’t take creative risks yourself." — President Adam Abdalla Adam Abdalla's Cultural Counsel has always operated at the intersection of art, ideas and power, but in 2024, the firm’s influence extended beyond the art world to shaping entire cities. With engagements from the Mayor’s Office in Boston, the City of Miami Beach and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cultural Counsel is now defining how municipalities position themselves as cultural capitals. At the institutional level, the firm delivered national press for the Art Dealers Association of America’s collaboration with Henry Street Settlement and spearheaded media strategy forThe Great Elephant Migration, an awe-inspiring conservation initiative sending 100 handcrafted elephant sculptures across the country, from Blackfeet Nation to Art Basel Miami Beach, securing high-profile coverage in The New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning, Vogue and NBC. For Theaster Gates’ blockbuster exhibition at CAMH, Cultural Counsel landed him a T Magazine cover, while its campaign for Counterpublic’s transfer of Sugarloaf Mound to the Osage Nation applied national pressure for the final parcel of land to be returned. The firm’s reach was equally evident during Art Basel Miami Beach, orchestrating a Pérez Art Museum Miami presentation featuring Kate Capshaw, director Franklin Sirmans and Miami barber Sergei Grant. Meanwhile, it led the media push for the American Academy of Arts and Letters’ public launch and the Columbus Museum of Art’s first solo show for painter Robin F. Williams. Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD tapped Cultural Counsel for its launch and the rollout of AGGRO DR1FT, a neon-drenched cinematic experiment that has become an underground phenomenon and the firm managed the publicity blitz for Making Their Mark, the Komal Shah and Shah Garg Foundation’s ambitious exhibition highlighting 84 women artists, curated by Cecilia Alemani. "The quality of your work is characterized by your broader frame of reference," Abdalla tells Observer. Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Cultural Counsel has cemented itself as the firm that bridges artists, institutions and the broader cultural discourse. culturalcounsel.com "Don’t be gimmicky. Tell your client’s story before it gets distorted by other engines of information. 'No comment' is not a strategy; it allows clickbait warriors to fill the void." — Founder John Melick Blue Medium has long been a powerhouse in art, design and architecture, but 2024 marked a defining year with the addition of major new clients—including superstar artist KAWS and Australia’s leading First Nations art gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, with locations in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. Founder John Melick’s agency continues to shape the cultural landscape, representing the Andy Warhol Museum, the Outsider Art Fair, Mystic Seaport Museum, Andrew Edlin Gallery, Greensboro’s Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundation, alongside an expanding roster of institutions such as MCA Australia, the Kallir Research Institute and the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, which champions Puerto Rican and Latinx artists. The firm’s design and architecture practice remains just as formidable, with clients like Beyer Blinder Belle, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Miami Center for Architecture and Design and Friedman Benda, one of NYC’s premier design galleries. Blue Medium helped the American Australian Association launch the Beverley Art Writers Travel Grant—which supports American art writers looking to explore Australia’s art scene—further cementing its role as a bridge between cultural spheres. Looking ahead, the firm is sharpening its focus on international expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where Melick hails from. With its partner agency, Bower Blue, Blue Medium is also doubling down on digital content, ensuring its clients’ narratives aren’t just well-placed but well-told across platforms. Melick's guiding philosophy? "Become deeply familiar with the editorial direction of an outlet, and then get to know, personally, the individuals who dedicate their careers to covering our spectacular communities." bluemedium.com “We needed to make sure that over 30 visiting journalists could experience artwork at a new biennial spread across 15 sites in the greater Toronto area in one day. So, we hired a bus and provided boxed lunches on board with the curators, who shared details about the various projects and were available for questions at and between sites. It’s an indication of the respect we have for journalists’ time, what they each want to focus on, and how we can best deliver useful information to them to craft their stories." — Principal Heather Meltzer Based in New York and Toronto, Heather Meltzer and Libby Mark's tiny boutique firm punches above its weight with clients including Toronto’s Contact Photography Festival, Nashville’s Frist Museum, the Friends of Florence Foundation, UCI Jack and Shanaz Langson Institute and Museum of California Art, Asian Cultural Council, Toronto’s Gardiner Museum, Toronto Biennial of Art and the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, a world-class botanical research and conservation institution in Sarasota, Florida—where long-awaited exhibition George Harrison: A Gardener’s Life opens this spring. The first net-positive energy botanical garden in the world, Selby Gardens blends sustainability and architectural innovation and expands public access to its renowned collection of epiphytes. Also on the horizon is the opening of The Wanlass Center for Art Education & Research at the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art at USU and the exhibition Venice and the Ottoman Empire opening at the Frist Art Museum in May. As to how the team balances creativity with a pressure to deliver results? "That really depends on the client and their appetite for exploring new ideas and different ways of doing things," Mark tells Observer. "Sometimes it’s a matter of offering options." "Having worked together for over 12 years as a team with either Libby or me taking the lead with each project, we know that this model gives our clients the support needed to promote their institutions and newsworthy moments,” Meltzer adds. bow-bridge.com “The arts and culture sector is facing pressure from every direction during this particularly volatile moment. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing need for support in crisis communications, issues management, change communications, and internal communications. We anticipate that this critical, behind-the-scenes work will continue to be a major focus in 2025, in tandem with our work to advance audience engagement and impact.” Founder & President David Resnicow It took four years for Michelangelo to complete the Sistine Chapel, but only one year—2024—for this dynamic firm to win a dazzling display of new business, including returning client the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Academy in Rome, Gladstone Gallery, National Gallery of Art, Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, John Michael Kohler Arts Center and SCOPE Art Show. They join a powerhouse list of current clients, including the Rubell Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Frick Collection, Park Avenue Armory and the San Francisco Ballet. For the U.S. Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale, the firm led an 18-month media blitz around the space in which to place me, Jeffrey Gibson’s groundbreaking solo exhibition—the first by an Indigenous artist to represent the U.S. in Venice. With 11 international cover stories and over 760 pieces of coverage, R+A catalyzed a global conversation on Indigenous art’s place in contemporary culture. This marks the ninth time in 14 years that R+A has represented the U.S. Pavilion, a streak that speaks for itself. Back home, R+A played a critical role in shaping the public narrative around The Apollo’s 90th anniversary season, securing major coverage for a milestone-packed year—The Apollo’s first-ever expansion, the 90th anniversary of Amateur Night, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ Walk of Fame induction and its history-making Kennedy Center Honor. The result? National and international attention, including CBS Sunday Morning, CBS Mornings and a four-page Washington Post feature. Capping off five consecutive years of record-breaking growth, R+A hit its highest revenue in 2024 and expanded to a team of 39. With a focus on its digital practice and team, R+A hired digital coordinator Lila Tulp. Director Claire Hurley returned to R+A after four years at Pace Gallery, where she worked closely with leading contemporary artists as well as major foundations and estates on campaigns. In the world of cultural communications, R+A remains the firm to beat. resnicow.com We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Streamer Dr Disrespect's YouTube income ban lifted after scandal
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86355xpl8no
Time Published: 2025-01-31T11:48:17Z
Full Content:
Controversial gaming streamer Herschel 'Guy' Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, has said he is able to start making money from YouTube again after being dropped in 2024. His announcement came on the same day as the gaming studio he co-founded said it was "closing its doors after three incredible years". Developer Midnight Society, which was working on shooter game Deadrop, cut ties with the YouTuber last year after becoming aware of "an allegation" against him. Beahm denied any wrongdoing, but admitted sending messages to "an individual minor" in 2017, insisting "nothing illegal happened". The content creator has 4.5 million subscribers on the platform and was dropped by various sponsors but declared on his stream on Thursday that "we've got our YouTube monetisation back". In a statement to BBC Newsbeat, YouTube said it had "reinstated" Dr Disrespect to its partner program "after careful review of the channel's recent activity". "Dr Disrespect was previously suspended... for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action," it added. The Dr Disrespect character gained popularity for his chaotic style of play and aggressive - at times rude - commentary. Last year, Midnight Society terminated Beahm's role at the company, four years after he was abruptly kicked off streaming platform Twitch, where he had a big following. In 2022, Beahm and Twitch agreed a settlement, where neither party admitted any wrongdoing. The reason for his removal then was never made clear - with the Amazon-owned platform only saying it acted whenever users broke the rules. Last June, a former Twitch employee said the removal was linked to messages sent to a minor. Beahm responded: "Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me." He did though apologise to his "community and colleagues" for his actions. "That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father... it should have never happened", he wrote on social media. He was suspended from YouTube's partner program and retreated from streaming until September. In November he signed a deal with video platform Rumble to head its gaming division. The closure of Midnight Society comes amid wider struggles in the games industry, with Ubisoft and Bioware among notable companies already announcing cuts in 2025. Midnight Society previously announced layoffs in September 2024 but said it remained committed to releasing the game this year. In its statement announcing its closure, the company apologised for being "unable to reach our ultimate goal" of making Deadrop. The game got its start through the sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - "one-of-a-kind" digital assets that experience an intial boom before vastly dropping in value. Some who invested have asked the company if they will be receiving refunds. BBC Newsbeat has requested comment from Midnight Society but not heard back. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. Following a TikTok ban in the US, phones and iPads with the TikTok app preinstalled are up for sale. Experts say it's a security disaster waiting to happen. Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision. The US government says Chinese apps and online activities threaten Americans' security. But US internet users can't get enough of Chinese memes. The US President says he would like to see a "bidding war" over the sale of the social media app. More government help is needed to fund start-up companies in the gaming sector, says a chief exec.

Title: How Democrats alienated Big Tech — and why it might not matter

When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Democrats have paid a political price for taking on Silicon Valley — but not a very expensive one. by Eric Levitz In January 2017, Sergey Brin rallied beside progressive activists at San Francisco International Airport to protest Donald Trump’s travel ban. Eight years later, the Google co-founder sat with right-wing nationalists at Trump’s second inauguration. Brin is far from the only tech mogul who has (apparently) warmed to Trump in recent years. Mark Zuckerberg once bankrolled liberal causes. Now, the Facebook founder dines with America’s favorite insurrectionist at Mar-a-Lago. In 2016, Marc Andreessen argued that Hillary Clinton was the “obvious choice” for president, and that any proposal to choke off immigration “makes me sick to my stomach.” Last year, Andreessen endorsed Trump. And, of course, Elon Musk has gone from being an Obama-supporting climate hawk to quite possibly the single most influential advocate for — and patron of — far-right politics in the United States. The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. Silicon Valley’s apparent rightward shift was already causing consternation in blue America last year. But Democrats’ outrage and anxiety over the red-pilling of Silicon Valley has only increased since Inauguration Day — when Brin, Zuckerberg, Musk, Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook all sat with Trump’s camp in the Capitol Rotunda. Some Democrats view Big Tech’s rightward lurch as a political crisis, one brought on by their own party’s policy mistakes. In this account, Democrats needlessly alienated a powerful industry by embracing an anti-corporate economic agenda that is both politically costly and substantively misguided. Others in the party, meanwhile, insist that the Biden administration’s attempts to tame Big Tech’s power were both good politics and good policy. In their telling, voters hate corporate monopolies and love antitrust enforcement. And the extraordinary wealth and power of large tech companies constitute a threat to democratic government — a reality that Silicon Valley’s present chumminess with Trump only underscores. From this vantage, the tech industry’s interests and the general public’s were always irreconcilable. And as Silicon Valley grew wealthier, it was bound to gravitate toward America’s more pro-business party. The Biden administration’s error, therefore, was not doing too much to antagonize Big Tech, but too little. This debate collapses together several distinct questions. Some of these are ideological — such as whether the Biden administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement was worthwhile on the merits. Today though, I want to focus on two factual questions at the center of the intra-Democratic dispute over Big Tech: I think the answers to both these questions are more complicated than either progressive or pro-business Democrats allow. To understand why Silicon Valley has moved right in recent years, it’s helpful to consider what had previously tethered the industry to the center-left. Many in the tech world argue that Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party were long bound by an implicit “deal”: Democrats would support the development of new technology, celebrate entrepreneurs, and take a light touch approach to regulating the digital sphere — in exchange for tech moguls backing socially liberal causes, progressive taxation, incremental expansions of the welfare state, philanthropies, and Democratic candidates. This was a pretty good bargain for the typical tech founder — since it effectively entailed the Democratic Party embracing nearly all of their preferences. Survey data on the views of Silicon Valley moguls is limited. But a 2017 study of tech entrepreneurs’ politics found that they were left-leaning on almost all issues — including taxation and redistribution — but quite right-wing on questions of government regulation and labor unions. This distinct ideological profile has been dubbed “liberal-tarian.” Given that Democrats have always been the party more supportive of regulating industry and promoting organized labor, the party’s alliance with tech was long fraught with some tension. But in recent years, both sides began souring on their supposed contract for a variety of reasons. But three were especially significant: When an industry is enjoying explosive growth, it has less incentive to align with the right. Democrats might nibble into its profits with their relatively high taxes, or inch its compliance costs with their greater regulatory scrutiny. But when your sector is awash in cheap financing and soaring revenues, the price of allying with a left-of-center party can look negligible. As Andreessen put the point to the New York Times earlier this month, back in the days of Clinton and Obama, “the tax rates didn’t really matter because when an internet company worked, it grew so fast and got so valuable that if you worked another three years, say, you’d make another 10 X. Another 5 percent higher tax rate washed out in the numbers.” Silicon Valley enjoyed such favorable conditions for much of the 2010s. But the tech boom faded during Biden’s tenure. In 2022, rising interest rates started diverting capital away from the tech sector: With safe assets now offering an attractive guaranteed return, investors grew more reluctant to funnel cash into risky ones. Stock market valuations fell and layoffs spread. At the same time, as Noah Smith notes, tech investors and executives started running up against structural constraints on profit-making. Many venture capitalists looked at Google and Facebook’s success in cornering and dominating their respective markets, and bet that they could establish similarly monopolistic businesses in other corners of digital commerce. But by 2022, they’d discovered that achieving such market dominance was harder than they’d thought. Meanwhile, social media companies struggled to combat the inherently finite nature of human attention: Once you’ve lured roughly 5 billion humans onto social media — and turned a hefty percentage of them into addicts — there’s only so much screen time left to monetize. In this context, we would expect tech moguls who’d been only lightly committed to the “liberal” part of liberal-tarianism to start heeding their own narrow material interests. After all, it was a similar mix of rising interest rates, inflation, and slowing profitability that helped prompt corporate America’s right turn in the 1970s. To be sure, the tech industry’s fortunes have rebounded since 2022, thanks in no small part to the AI boom. But the experience of a capital crunch and profit squeeze — however temporary — seems to have made a lasting impression on many in tech, whose political contributions began shifting (modestly) toward Republicans in 2022. For the reasons above, it wouldn’t have been surprising for the tech industry to have drifted toward Republicans over the past four years, even if Democratic policy remained as friendly to tech as had it been under Barack Obama. In reality, the Biden administration took a much more adversarial stance than its predecessors. Biden’s Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department collectively brought antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft. This blitzkrieg of aggressive antitrust enforcement naturally irritated Silicon Valley’s giants. Perhaps less predictably, it also antagonized smaller tech firms and startups. In theory, one might expect “little tech” would want the government to curb the market power of their gargantuan competitors. In practice, however, many startup founders and investors aspire to either grow their own firms into behemoths, or failing that, get bought up by a larger company. By chilling merger activity, the Biden administration effectively blocked many startups’ “plan B,” while choking off a reliable source of returns for venture capitalists. VCs and startups also took exception to the Biden Securities and Exchange Commission’s vigorous regulation of cryptocurrency, as well as the administration’s executive order on AI safety. In November 2023, a contingent of startup founders and investors denounced the latter, arguing that the order’s reporting requirements put small AI firms at a competitive disadvantage, as they could less comfortably shoulder regulatory compliance costs than their larger rivals. Finally, Biden proposed a new tax on the unrealized capital gains of Americans with more than $100 million in wealth. This would mean that when a megamillionaire investor’s stock portfolio or real estate holdings gained $5 million in value, they would need to pay a tax on that amount, even if they did not sell those assets. Tax policy wonks like this idea. But super-rich tech investors very much do not. And when Kamala Harris announced her support for Biden’s plan last summer, Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists had a conniption. Super-rich tech moguls care about making money. But they are often at least as covetous of social status. Past a certain point, accumulating more wealth has little practical impact on your living standards (or those of your children, or your children’s children). But a person’s appetite for greater prestige tends to be less exhaustible than their desire for beach homes, Porsches, or private jets. Thus, if Democrats had spent the past decade exalting tech investors and founders, it’s possible that the party’s increasingly adversarial policies would have caused less rancor in Silicon Valley. But Democrats became increasingly disillusioned with the tech industry over the course of the 2010s. And this culminated in a Democratic administration that undermined tech billionaires’ sense of self-importance. “At the core level, both Barack Obama and the modal Democrat thought the average Silicon Valley company was really good and cool in 2009,” Marc Aidinoff, a historian and policy adviser in both the Obama and Biden administrations, told me. “Obama would go to Silicon Valley and have dinner with the CEOs and call them champions of change. What these people really wanted from the president was the sense that they were loved.” But by 2021, things had changed, according to Aidinoff. “Joe Biden distrusts these people, thinks they are hurting Americans, and has the sense that they aren’t actually making much of real value,” he said. The Democrats’ disenchantment with tech wasn’t attributable to Biden’s personal skepticism of Silicon Valley alone. After the financial crisis, the party’s progressive wing grew more influential. And its ascent increased the salience of both inequality and labor issues in Democratic politics. For a party increasingly concerned with wealth concentration and workers’ rights, tech giants that generated vast fortunes off “winner-take-all” markets — while, in many cases, committing labor violations or undermining traditional employment — did not look like engines of progress. As importantly, the notion that social media platforms promoted democracy and social reform fell into disrepute. In the wake of Obama’s election and the Arab Spring — both of which were widely credited to novel media technologies — many liberals bought into the idea that Facebook and Twitter would abet a more egalitarian politics. But authoritarian regimes proved adept at restricting online speech. And if social media’s potential to facilitate rightwing extremism wasn’t clear to liberals before 2016, it was apparent to them afterward. Following Trump’s victory, many Democrats blamed their party’s defeat on Facebook’s dissemination of “fake news.” Around the same time, research suggesting that social media could have adverse mental health effects started to accumulate. All this — combined with tech platforms’ adverse impact on traditional journalism — led the mainstream media to view Silicon Valley more critically. Between 2012 and 2019, the New York Times’ coverage of Facebook turned sharply negative, according to one prominent data analysis. Add in Silicon Valley’s growing enthusiasm for crypto — a technology that appeared to be good for little beyond scams and speculation — and it isn’t hard to see why Democrats soured on Big Tech. The party’s newfound skepticism of the industry didn’t just translate into greater regulatory scrutiny, but also, a withholding of both praise and access. According to some in tech, the sector’s leading lights felt themselves shunned and slighted by the Biden White House. “I think the fundamental problem, and I heard this from many, was that former President Biden was unwilling to meet with tech CEOs and entrepreneurs,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me. “It was that simple.” One former Biden official echoed this assessment, saying that tech companies “couldn’t get meetings with a lot of the key regulators. Certainly [FTC commissioner] Lina [Khan] wouldn’t meet with people — she liked to say, ‘We’re enforcement, you can’t really meet with us.’” Andreessen recently reminisced that Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party had “celebrated” and “loved” tech companies. Biden’s Democratic Party, by contrast, often refused Andreessen’s ilk the time of day. It’s clear then that Silicon Valley’s rightward turn was precipitated, at least in part, by a change in the Democratic Party’s attitudes and policies toward the tech industry. And there’s reason to think that the party’s anti-tech turn is politically costly on net. Were other tech billionaires to emulate Musk’s political giving — or other social media companies to imitate X’s boosting of right-wing content — the damage to Democrats could be considerable. And the Trump administration’s manifest openness to trading political power for financial support makes this a live possibility, especially if Democrats promise to reprise the Biden administration’s policies toward the industry. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that aggressively regulating Silicon Valley can gain Democrats meaningful support elsewhere. This is not because voters oppose that general goal: In fact, in a 2024 Pew Research poll, a slight majority expressed support for increasing regulation of the tech industry, while a supermajority said that social media has had a “mostly negative” effect on the United States. The problem is that voters have ambivalent feelings about Big Tech writ large, and do not consider regulating the companies a priority. When Gallup asked Americans what their country’s most important problem was this month, only 1 percent named “corporate corruption” while 0 percent picked “technology.” In a post-election survey from Morning Consult and the Chamber of Progress (a trade group of companies allied with the Democratic Party), voters were presented with a list of 12 issues, and asked to name the two that were most important to their vote. Only 2 percent of respondents picked “regulating technology companies” as one of their priorities, making it the single least prioritized objective on the list (by contrast, 49 percent selected “controlling inflation and strengthening the economy”). Meanwhile, in YouGov’s polling, Amazon’s approval rating sits at 74 percent, Google’s at 70 percent, Apple’s at 69 percent, and Facebook at 59 percent. Given all this, it’s plausible that Democrats have more to lose than gain politically from taking on Big Tech. Yet it’s also true that the political costs of the party’s anti-tech turn have been routinely overstated. In truth, Silicon Valley’s rightward shift — while real — has been remarkably modest, whether measured in votes or donations. In 2020, Biden won Santa Clara County, which includes much of Silicon Valley, by 48 points. Four years later, he won it by 40 points. There’s some evidence that tech workers and executives became more likely to donate to Republicans during the Biden era. But 83 percent of Amazon employees’ donations to federal candidates went to Democrats in 2024; for Meta, that figure was 91.5 percent; for Apple, it was 95 percent. At the megadonor level, the story is a bit more complicated. Trump received more money from tech donors who spent over $1 million on the 2024 race than Harris did — but that’s mostly thanks to Musk’s prodigious giving. Musk spent $242.6 million on the 2024 election, nearly five times as much as Silicon Valley’s second-largest political spender, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, a Democrat. And yet, it’s hard to attribute Musk’s political evolution to recent changes in Democratic policy. The Tesla CEO appears to have been undergoing a process of online radicalization even before Biden took office (in March 2020, Musk allegedly bet the writer Sam Harris $1 million that there would be fewer than 35,000 cases of Covid-19 in the United States, a conviction that seems symptomatic of his immersion in right-wing social media). If we deem Musk a special case and put him to the side, then Democrats retained their advantage with large tech donors in 2024: Combined, all other tech megadonors spent $30.6 million on Trump, and $120.9 million on Harris, according to an analysis from The Guardian. In any case, money was not the Democrats’ problem in 2024. The party and its allied groups outraised the GOP by $1.1 billion during last year’s campaign. To be sure, many Silicon Valley billionaires waited until after Election Day to cozy up to Trump, so their newfound support for the GOP would not be captured by this data. But those who only started currying Trump’s favor once he secured the presidency are likely motivated less by antipathy for Democratic policy than awareness of Republican corruption: Trump has made it quite clear that his friends can expect favorable treatment by his government while his foes can anticipate the opposite. “A number of people in tech led with vinegar during Trump’s first term and learned that it was better with Trump to lead with honey,” Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and chair of the Chamber of Progress, told me. “It’s not so much that they expect a lot, but they really don’t want their companies to be hurt by Trump. If your competitors are building a close relationship with Trump, you don’t want them to screw you.” All of which is to say: The Democrats have paid a price for their crusade against Big Tech, but not a prohibitively expensive one. None of this settles the debate over whether Democrats were right to take a more adversarial posture toward the tech industry under Biden. Moderate Democrats can look at this pattern of facts and conclude that Biden’s agenda alienated a powerful industry and did little to increase their party’s popular support, all while discouraging growth and innovation. Progressives, meanwhile, can counter that Democrats just proved they can take on concentrated corporate power and still retain an overwhelming financial advantage over the GOP — and thus, the party has no excuse not to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of tech billionaires. Ultimately though, the important disagreement here is the substantive one. If Democrats can ingratiate themselves to tech billionaires in ways that have little substantive cost — such as giving them face time or rhetorical encouragement — they might be well-advised to do so. But the party as of yet faces no imperative to abandon policies that benefit the general public, for the sake of appeasing Silicon Valley titans.

Per the memo, these cuts appear related to Amazon’s controversial return to office policy. In September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy notified employees that they would be expected to return to the office five days per week beginning in 2025, but the decision sparked blowback from employees. “We identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn’t solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads,” wrote SVP Drew Herdener in the memo seen by TechCrunch. “To address this and do the right thing for the business, we’re eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability.” Herdener referenced a recent meeting with Jassy, where the CEO said that reducing company headcount was not a goal of reorganizing the workforce; Herdener claims that the overall headcount of his department will remain unchanged once Amazon rehires for some of these roles at lower levels. When reached by TechCrunch, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser declined to tell TechCrunch how many jobs were eliminated. The laid off employees will receive “financial support, benefit continuation, and job placement assistance,” per the memo. These cuts in sustainability and corporate responsibility roles come less than two weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had a close-up seat at the inauguration, sitting close behind Trump and alongside other tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sergey Brin. Bezos, like other prominent tech founders, donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. The layoffs at Amazon stem from a restructuring project that began before Trump’s election. But the relationship between Bezos and the new administration could be a harbinger of future corporate moves at Amazon. Since Trump took office, Amazon has already canceled some diversity and inclusion initiatives, which have also been targeted by the new administration. Trump’s administration has already reversed sustainability initiatives at a federal level. So far, the president has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty addressing climate change. He even declared a national emergency in order to promote the production of fossil fuels, as opposed to more sustainable energy sources. Updated to include Amazon’s decline.

lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis. While everyone was busy reassuring themselves the stock market was still A-OK, the driver of the market--the AI fad--just burned to the waterline. Yes, the current euphoric expectations for AI are a fad, the latest in the endless stream of "gotta have" status signifiers and cultural frenzies. The core dynamic in all fads is Human Wetware 1.0. Though we glorify our individuality--The primacy of the Individual is the key characteristic of Modernity--we remain a herd animal, alert to every twitch in the herd's emotional state and anxious to join the herd when it starts running, lest we're left behind or lose status. CEOs are just as prone to fads as the rest of us, and this is how the AI fad gathered momentum. A decade ago the warm-and-fuzzy tech fad that enamored every corporate HQ was fuzzy logic, one of the long line of precursors to the current AI mania. So labels touting "fuzzy logic" were slapped on rice cookers as everyone scrambled to cash in on the latest tech fad. And so now every package of Kroika Cookies is emblazoned with "powered by AI!" Indeed. The leaders of the herd are especially keen to study every shift in the zeitgeist and the pecking order, as the greatest sin for CEOs is to be revealed as incompetent / clueless by missing the latest boat in corporate fads. Here is one example of the catastrophic consequences not of missing the boat but of blindly climbing on board. On a flight to Shanghai in May 2000, shortly after the NASDAQ dot-com bubble had peaked, my seatmate was a senior engineer working for a Silicon Valley semiconductor equipment maker. Over the course of the long flight, he recounted the domino-like chain of disastrous results of the CEO jumping on the "gotta offshore production" fad that was sweeping through Corporate America. The net result of moving production to Southeast Asia and China was 1) the wholesale theft of intellectual property (IP) and 2) the collapse of quality, requiring technicians to be flown in to fix all the quality problems. But to not move production overseas would have been perceived as "missing the boat," so everyone rushed to join the thundering herd, whether it made any sense or not. The second dynamic in play now is this: monopolies don't care about efficiency or quality, as the user / consumer has no real alternative. The tech world is brimming with stories of corporate wealth being squandered on teams developing efficiencies that are shelved upon completion. The more money gushing into the corporate coffers, the less interest there is in efficiencies. Keeping the Good Ship Status Quo on course is good enough--until the Status Quo burns to the waterline. Then the scramble is to cover the disastrous mis-allocation of corporate capital and identify the next fad to join. The third dynamic is: this isn't about one company. It's about a toolbox that's already infected the entire tech world. It doesn't matter if DeepSeek disappears tomorrow: the toolbox of software structures they've released has already entered the bloodstream of global tech and has already transformed the DNA. There's no going back to brute-force processing as any sort of competitive advantage. Rather, it's a cost anchor that will drag any denialist laggards to the bottom. The fourth dynamic is: there's nothing investable in this disruption because everyone can now develop the same open-source tools and approaches. there is no monopolistic moat to guarantee profits, and no revenue stream to milk. Rather, like deploying billions of dollars on data farms to improve search, there is no revenue at all. Nobody's paying a single dollar for AI enhanced search. As I've noted before, when the tools and techniques are freely available to all, there's no scarcity value to any of it. And with no scarcity value--no value proposition so mighty that people will pay a premium for it--then profits are thin to zero. The "smart money" has noted the AI fad has burned to the waterline, and has been frantically assuring "dumb money" that the stock market bubble is still intact and poised to bubble higher, so there's no reason to sell, and every reason to "buy the dip" so the "smart money" can sell, sell, sell near the top and let the "dumb money" absorb the coming 80% decline as a fad that was poorly conceived from the start has burned to the waterline, and the tiniest wave will send it to the bottom. The "safe bet" was on heavily moated tech behemoths dumping billions of dollars into the "competitive advantage" of energy-ravenous processing power. That "safe bet" is now in Davy Jones' Locker. The reality that "AI has no revenues and no profits" is lingering above the burned-out hulk as a haze of doubt and confusion. What's the next fad? Stay tuned. It might just be a retro revival of the time-tested fad for cost-cutting and "return to basics," starting with mass layoffs and slashing capex budgets. Sometimes wide moats and billions of dollars to blow lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis.

The company is laying off dozens of people in the department, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). “Following a recent review, we’re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in the report. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been cut at the company since Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021, according to the report. These included 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles, per the report. Jassy said in September that Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online at the time, Jassy wrote that Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organization’s ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time. It was reported Jan. 15 that tech giants Meta and Microsoft were cutting back on their headcounts, with Meta set to cut its workforce by 5% and Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its consulting business and lay off some employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that monitors job cuts in the tech sector, 545 tech companies laid off a total of 152,664 employees in 2024. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

In a note to staffers viewed by CNBC, Drew Herdener, who oversees public relations and corporate responsibility, wrote that the company is eliminating some jobs in those groups as part of a wider review into the "current org design" of the divisions. "As we examined our current org design and decided on the shifts outlined above, we identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn't solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads," Herdener wrote. "To address this and do the right thing for the business, we're eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability. This is a difficult decision to make and one that my leadership team and I do not take lightly." Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the layoffs and said in a statement that the job cuts would "help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers." Bloomberg earlier reported the job cuts. Herdener went on to say that the company may rehire some employees for roles at lower levels, "and in others, we will redistribute the headcount to other areas within the org." Amazon will provide financial support, continued benefits and job-placement assistance to laid-off staffers, Herdener said. Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company in 2022 and 2023 as part of CEO Andy Jassy's efforts to rein in costs. It had smaller rounds of job cuts in 2024 that are stretching into this year. The company has also continued to wind down some of its more experimental or unprofitable initiatives, including a "Try Before You Buy" clothing service and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery program. Herdener said Amazon is streamlining its communications and sustainability divisions after the organization "grew quite a bit" in recent years. Herdener's role expanded in recent years and he now also oversees corporate responsibility, which includes the sustainability group. Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding staffers to its corporate workforce and in its hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. Its global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company had more than 1.5 million employees as of the end of the third quarter. Amazon is also making some changes to its "hub strategy," which dictates the offices teams primarily use, as part of the reorganization, Herdener said. The goal is to have "more team members working in the same physical location as the majority of their teammates and/or manager," he wrote. Herdener said he is leaving it up to his direct reports to decide which locations make sense for their teams. Earlier this month, Amazon began requiring corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office. In a push to get employees back to the office, some staffers were told to relocate to hubs in different states. Several Amazon employees told CNBC following the announcement of the "return to hub" policy that they had chosen to leave the company instead of relocating. As part of the five-day office mandate, Amazon also set a goal to flatten its corporate structure by having fewer managers in each organization. Amazon has made sustainability a bigger directive within the company. It set ambitious climate goals in 2019, including a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2040. It also aims to power its business operations with renewable energy sources by 2025, and has amassed a portfolio of more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.

Title: Marketers Say They Are Ready To Move Beyond Google Search

Search is changing and marketers say they’re ready for it. A new study from Botify found that 94% of marketing leaders say they are at least somewhat prepared to optimize brand visibility for AI search, with almost 42% saying they’re very prepared. Not only are they prepared, but they’re enthusiastic, too. Nearly two-thirds were excited by Gartner’s prediction that AI chatbots will cause a 25% drop in traditional search engine traffic by 2026, and 74% were excited by what they’ve seen so far with ChatGPT Search. While the study shows that marketers are welcoming the challenge of moving away from Google’s long dominance in basic online search, how they’re getting ready is different across the board. More than six in 10 said they’re adjusting their strategies, but what they’re adjusting for varies. The survey asked marketers what they think of when someone mentions non-Google search, and while OpenAI products got high marks—56% think of ChatGPT and 42% think of SearchGPT—many are thinking more along the lines of traditional social channels. YouTube was the most popular alternative, with just over two-thirds thinking of it, but Meta and TikTok were each considered by about 40% of respondents. (The study was conducted in December, before the TikTok ban-or-sale law was upheld or enacted.) Nearly 45% thought about e-commerce giant Amazon. While marketers have been working on their social media and e-commerce search strategies for years, there’s a steep learning curve in figuring out just what to do for generative AI marketing plans. Just over half—55%—say understanding how platforms work is a major challenge. About the same amount said they’re concerned about data privacy. And nearly half are worried about how to keep up with the pace of innovation. The good news for marketers is that there’s a lot in flux with generative AI search. Tools are being refined, algorithms are changing, systems are “learning” better answers, and different types of information are being prioritized. It’s a good time for marketers to experiment and try new things to see what works, especially since generative AI platforms are doing the same thing. And the fact that most marketers see this as an opportunity means that creative solutions are likely to come from all areas, with potential for unexpected and positive results. Technology has been changing the way things work for years. It’s had huge impacts on creators, democratizing the ability for people to create something, put it out into the world and have it make a difference. Legendary record industry executive Steve Stoute saw opportunities in technology, and harnessed its opportunity for the music industry by starting UnitedMasters in 2017. I talked to him about how UnitedMasters is augmenting the creator economy, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The CNN logo outside its Atlanta studios. Another sign of the times for traditional broadcast media: Last week, CNN cut about 6% of its workforce—about 200 employees, mainly on the broadcast side—but continued hiring for digital media jobs. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes the cuts shouldn’t have been a surprise. CNN has been losing viewership as many people change the way they look for and consume news. Benzinga reports that since the election in November, CNN has lost 47% of its primetime viewers, hitting a 30-year ratings low for the network. When the cuts were announced, CNN CEO Mark Thompson said the network will soon launch a streaming service, revamp its digital footprint and subscriber services and make changes to its lineup—and the total headcount at the news organization should be about the same when all is done. Bloom writes that Thompson has been working for about a year to figure out how to remake CNN for today’s viewer. Many other legacy networks that have seen the same types of issues—especially MSNBC and ABC News—are likely to be paying close attention. An image from László Gaál's video. A new, “speculative” commercial featuring Porsche from digital artist László Gaál is attracting a lot of attention. It tells the story of the Italian Pisano family, which has long been known in their small village for having extremely flexible necks. The reason: A neighbor of their ancestral home who loves sports cars regularly drives the latest Porsche models past the Pisanos’ balcony. The detailed story, which includes a variety of locations, a large cast and innovative camera shots, isn’t the attention-grabbing part. The entire commercial—including the vast majority of the “How I made this” behind-the-scenes interview with Gaál at the end—was AI-generated, writes Forbes contributor Roger Dooley. Gaál used Veo2 from Google DeepMind, which is still in experimental mode, to create everything except the scenes when he personally is on camera, spinning a tale of the locations, cast and crew needed for the commercial. Unlike the somewhat clunky and not-always-logical AI-generated Coca-Cola holiday commercials last year, this commercial is widely praised for its realistic feel. On a Reddit thread, Gaál said the entire commercial took about three weeks to make. The video has several disclaimers throughout that indicate it was made almost entirely by AI (and was also not actually created in conjunction with Porsche). But more obscure, low tech AI creations—known as AI slop—are increasingly proliferating on social media, often without anything to tell viewers that the images aren’t real. On Facebook, some users post over-the-top AI-generated images, sometimes daring people to believe them. They’re widely believed and accepted as real. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “loved” a viral AI-generated photo last week of a baker who created an intricate loaf of challah bread shaped like an actual-size horse, Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido writes. The photo was originally posted on a Polish satire site, and has been widely shared to show the baker’s “feat”—despite the fact that designing and baking a complex loaf of bread that size that looks so good is a nearly impossible task. And Di Placido writes Zuckerberg’s reaction could just be recognizing a well-made AI-generated image. The header photo on the centibillionaire’s own Facebook page is an AI-generated one of llamas standing on and around computer servers. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about why his business model—and the creator economy as a whole—is thriving. This conversation contains expletives, and has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. 2024 was an incredible year for UnitedMasters, especially with UnitedMasters artist FloyyMenor having the global No. 1 song on TikTok, “Gata Only.” What did you see proven with your business model last year? Stoute: When we first did this, I knew that [it would help] the mid-to-long tail artists, who probably would’ve never gotten a record deal because they couldn’t get to New York or LA, to the cities where record deals were given out, or because they took longer to develop. They would not necessarily get a deal. If we were able to give them a home, they would be able to earn a living by doing what they love. It’s being able to earn a living with doing something you love. That, I think, [is] what makes the world a better place, so that’s what I was focused on. All of a sudden, it wasn’t just for the mid-to-long tail. The big frontline artists wanted independence. They wanted to own their masses. They wanted to get the economics in their favor. And with FloyyMenor from Chile, he didn't have to go to Miami or LA or New York to get a record deal. He uploaded the song from his home and had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year, the No. 6 Spotify song of the year, a top 10 Apple Music song of the year. What that means is we’re happy. That’s another artist who got a chance to maximize their economics because of our platform. No. 2, what it shows is that the metric that the big guys use to justify success, we’re doing that too. We weren’t ever in the game that had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year. We were here to give people a platform and allow them the opportunity to do what they love and earn a living. It’s like if somebody's writing on Substack and then they’re the No. 1 published author in the New York Times. They didn’t build Substack for that. They built it for people to make a living. But if it hits that metric, then all of a sudden Penguin and all the big guys go, wait a minute. They’re playing in my game. How does the creator economy play into your business? I felt like musicians were left out of the creator economy because everyone thought the labels were handling that. The creator economy was really focused on gamers and makeup bloggers and vloggers and things like that. The music people had this thing called a record company. So that was that. The artists that did not have record deals were like: We are part of the creator economy. I think SoundCloud benefited from that. Early on, SoundCloud harbored the creator economy musicians, and then they wanted more. They didn’t want to just be on SoundCloud. They wanted distribution and opportunities. When I built UnitedMasters, I was building it not only to provide artist distribution, but we had Translation. We worked with the NBA and State Farm and AT&T and Meta, to name a few. We can not only distribute these artists, but we can do deals for them with some of these brands. The combination of being able to go to one place and get your music distributed, plus have access to brands for larger opportunities was the ecosystem I thought and I know, and is proving to be what a music company should look like going forward. From what you see, what is in store for 2025 for the creator economy as a whole? Outside of live sports, that’s where brands want to put their money. You have NFL, NBA, hockey, WNBA, and then you have the creator economy. You have podcasters and bloggers and streamers and musicians, and you’re like, how can I ring-fence that so I could measure the results within that infrastructure, and how can I protect brand safety in doing that? Brands are saying, I’m all-in for that. What the creator economy has to do is get brand ready: My shit’s together, it’s brand-friendly, it’s measurable. You can rely on us. Now you’re talking about a new medium that has money rushing towards it, that they didn’t expect to happen so fast so soon. They have to get leveled up. Major League Baseball reported it hit record revenues in 2024, with the largest one-season growth since 2015. $12.1 billion: Last year’s revenues, according to the league $1.9 billion: League and club sponsorships in 2024 ‘We’ve had a good year. Our business was strong’: MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Sportico in October, during the World Series While Bud Light’s now-infamous partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney caused fallout for the brand, not all of it was because conservative consumers were offended. The actual strategy was lacking, writes Forbes contributor Gillian Oakenfull. Here’s how to build a strategy for inclusivity campaigns so they won’t be seen as symbolic gestures, especially if they push the envelope. Storytelling is an important component of marketing, but it’s also a tool for leadership. Here are some ways to use storytelling to better connect with your team, build trust, and inspire ideas. On February 9, the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will meet in New Orleans to play Super Bowl LIX. Which of the following Super Bowl party food items saw the biggest price increase in the last year, according to Wells Fargo? A. Shrimp B. Chicken wings C. Potato chips D.
