UPDATED 10:53 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Nvidia came through on earnings this week, with little sign of slowing growth, but investors apparently didn’t like the lower gross margin and knocked shares down more than 8% Thursday. It almost counts as a win given the sky-high expectations. It was a mixed bag for other enterprise tech providers too, as whatever AI-driven boost they’re getting, enterprise customers are not yet spending enough to swing the needle. Snowflake, Workday and Nutanix surged, but not so much Dell, NetApp, HP, Pure Storage and Salesforce (which said its highly touted Agentforce services won’t contribute much to earnings until 2026). As theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and George Gibert have noted, a better data stack needs to arrive before agents can take off. AI uh-oh? Microsoft scrapped some data center leases, though it seems far from a stampede away from AI infra spending just yet, especially with Apple and Alibaba doubling down. Meta, in fact, is looking at spending $200 billion on a single AI data center. Plus, the demanding new AI models keep on coming, this week alone from OpenAI, Tencent, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Anthropic and more. Indeed, IBM is getting busier with AI, buying DataStax and debuting new Granite AI models. On the cloud front, it also just closed its $6.4 billion HashiCorp acquisition. No wonder CEO Arvind Krishna was bullish last month. Amazon finally upped the ante on AI with Alexa+, to pretty good reviews. Dell aims to help telecom providers finally move to the cloud and its shares got a one-day boost as a result. DOGE looks more and more like ransomware, says security expert Bruce Schneier. Except we can’t pay it to stop. Speaking of Elon Musk, how much more obvious does corruption need to be before anyone who can do something about it … does something about it? Quantum computing is drawing more attention from investors as the picks and shovels of Quantum Machines get a $170 million boost. And Amazon also introduced its first quantum chip, or at least the possibility of one. Next week is MWC, where theCUBE will be onsite in Barcelona for interviews and analysis. And there will be earnings from more enterprise bellwethers such as Broadcom, Marvell Semi, HPE, MongoDB, Okta, Box and CrowdStrike. This week’s OMG news (I thought this was a Onion article at first): Gayle King, Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry to lead Blue Origin all-women crewed mission. DEI may be dead on Earth, but I guess it’s OK in space? Here’s all the news from this week, and you can hear more about this and more in John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube: IBM buys DataStax to boost its watsonx data platform for AI applications Microsoft scraps some data center leases as Apple, Alibaba double down on AI Salesforce strikes multibillion-dollar deal to bring its AI agents to Google Cloud MongoDB acquires embedding model provider Voyage AI AI observability startup Arize AI raises $70M Series C round Exclusive: former Snowflake execs raise $5M for agentic AI that simplifies data operations AI-native accounting startup Quanta Financial raises $4.7M to automate bookkeeping in real time Exclusive: ClarityQ raises $3.7M to apply AI to digital product usage analysis WilsonAI raises $1.7M in pre-seed funding for ‘AI paralegal’ OpenAI expands LLM lineup with new general-purpose GPT-4.5 model IBM releases new Granite 3.2 family of models that include reasoning when you want it and some deeper analysis by Dave Vellante: IBM Granite 3.2 Ups the Ante on Open, Efficient, and Trusted Enterprise AI Amazon debuts LLM-powered Alexa+ with expanded automation features Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model can think for as long as you want Microsoft releases new Phi models optimized for multimodal processing, efficiency Tencent releases new AI model it says is faster than DeepSeek-R1 Meta reportedly planning to launch standalone Meta AI app ChatGPT Plus gets a huge deep research upgrade Perplexity AI is building a web browser for ‘agentic search’ Google launches free Gemini Code Assist tier for individuals Cisco expands partnership with Nvidia to drive enterprise AI adoption IDC debuts AI-fueled software procurement analysis service Alibaba makes AI video generation model free to use globally Olas launches decentralized AI marketplace where AI agents can hire each other Couchbase enables more nimble agentic AI development with Nvidia’s NIM Pinecone updates its vector database for “knowledgeable AI apps” CalypsoAI launches cybersecurity leaderboard for AI models StudyFetch’s new conversational AI-powered tutor is a ChatGPT for students Akool unleashes enhancements to its AI human 3D avatars connected to LLMs Strange: Researchers puzzled by AI that praises Nazis after training on insecure code There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Interesting piece by Ben Thompson of Stratechery: AI Promise and Chip Precariousness But his prescriptions ultimately seem unlikely to happen and not all of them, especially re: Intel, seem like a good idea. But like others, he calls for an end to chip export limitations.

Title: What Is Blackout Friday? Learn About the February 28 Economic Boycott

Hollywood Life Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News NewsExpand Menu EntertainmentExpand Menu BeautyExpand Menu FashionExpand Menu ShoppingExpand Menu TrendingExpand Menu Celebrity BiosExpand Menu A grassroots group called for a nationwide boycott of shopping at major retail chains. Learn how to participate here. Find Out A new movement is sweeping the nation on February 28, 2025, calling for a mass boycott of shopping at major retailers. The day — known online as “Blackout Friday” or the “economic blackout” — encourages Americans to avoid buying anything nonessential, such as fast food. In order to participate, people can purchase items from local and small businesses. Learn more about the February 28 economic blackout and how to participate below. The nationwide blackout is a movement that Americans can choose to participate in; it’s not a formal holiday nor an order by anyone in the government. Contrary to what critics assumed, the grassroots group known as The People’s Union USA clarified that the blackout is not associated with any political party. According to The People’s Union USA’s website, the group is “dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.” “We are NOT a political party, we are a movement for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, religion, or political affiliation,” the website indicates. “Our goal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) Behind The People’s Union USA is its founder, John Schwarz. According to its site, the group emphasizes that it stands “firmly for equality and freedom for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, background, or identity.” “The idea that companies and institutions should abandon diversity and inclusivity is regressive and unacceptable,” the group notes on its site, referring to the removal of DEI programs by major companies after Donald Trump‘s layoffs of federal DEI workers. “Every American deserves an equal chance at success, and we will not support policies that encourage discrimination or exclusion.” The People’s Union USA also indicates that it is not fighting against “one person,” such as Trump or Elon Musk. “This movement] is about the system as a whole,” the group emphasizes. “Both political parties, both past and current leaders, and billionaires have manipulated the economy and profited off the working class. We will hold them all accountable. Our focus is systemic change, not political drama.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) The February 28, 2025, economic blackout calls for consumers to avoid buying gas, fast food and/or buying anything online or in stores at the biggest retail chains. You can participate in the blackout — which is only the first of several others that The People’s Union USA has planned — by avoiding purchases at major corporations and retailers, such as Target and Amazon. If participants do need to make purchases, though, they are encouraged to only shop at local and small businesses. Items needed for medical purposes or emergencies can still be purchased. The February 28, 2025, economic blackout will end at midnight on March 1, 2025. The next blackout is scheduled to take place on March 28, 2025, and the third is set for April 18, 2025, according to The People’s Union USA. In March, there is a planned week-long blackout against Amazon; there is also one in April against Walmart. Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect

Title: Big Tech wants everyone to use AI, just not when applying for jobs

Happy Friday! What do Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King have in common? They are part of the first all-women space crew since 1963. Sánchez is leading the six-person crew on an 11-minute journey on one of her fiancé Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rockets. In today's big story, Amazon's love affair with AI doesn't extend to job candidates using it during interviews. What's on deck Markets: Goldman Sachs pulls back on DEI language in its annual report. It says it's just following the law. Tech: Internal xAI documents show how workers are instructed to suss out "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in Elon Musk's chatbot. Business: Netflix isn't losing sleep over your canceled subscription. In fact, you'll probably be back. But first, AI for me, but not for interviewees. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tech companies love AI. Just don't try to use it to get a job at one. Amazon created guidelines for its internal recruiters to sniff out job candidates who might be using AI during the hiring process, writes Business Insider's Eugene Kim. The tech giant's stance is that AI tools give candidates an "unfair advantage" that doesn't allow Amazon to evaluate their "authentic" skills, according to guidelines Eugene obtained. As a reminder, this is the same Amazon pouring billions of dollars into AI development in the hopes that AI tools become a key part of people's personal and professional lives. The same Amazon encouraging employees to use its AI chatbot at work. The same Amazon that would love to have its AI-powered Alexa+ in homes across America. With all that AI encouragement, it's not surprising candidates would turn to these tools to give themselves the best chance possible, especially when the market for tech jobs is so tough. Dealing with AI-powered interviewees isn't just an Amazon problem. For about as long as AI chatbots have been around, people have been figuring out how to use them to cheat get an advantage. BI's Rob Price has covered the topic extensively, writing about the "magic teleprompter" apps that feed candidates answers. Sometimes, using AI is just about passing a technical test to get a raise or to land a job. Other times, the tools are shadow stand-ins for people, doing some, if not all, of their actual work. While the latter might sound egregious, using AI tools to get a job that'll require you to use AI tools doesn't seem that out of line. Imagine if you had to try out for a track team but weren't allowed to wear running shoes. Why ban someone from using something they'll eventually need to succeed? I put that question to a tech recruiter. They said the problem is candidates solely relying on AI tools instead of having their own logic and general knowledge. It's a big issue, particularly with younger candidates fresh out of college, they added. Still, it's not like candidates haven't been trying to get an edge on interviews for years. The recruiter mentioned the 2008 book "Cracking the Coding Interview," which includes programming questions commonly asked during interviews. Sometimes, the recruiter has to stay a step ahead, like asking follow-up questions the chatbots might have trouble managing. And if all else fails, maybe AI can help with the AI problem. 1. Meet the fund manager who beats the S&P 500 again and again. Michael Cuggino's Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500, returning 28% versus the index's 17% on a trailing 12-month basis. Cuggino's fund also had a higher average annual gain than the S&P 500 over the past decade. The secret? The fund doesn't invest along themes or focus too much on specific indexes, instead prioritizing quality growth firms. 2. Nvidia still has something to prove. Despite strong earnings, one subject came up a bunch during Nvidia's Wednesday call: gross margins. CFO Colette Kress said expectations are in the "low 70s" for the current quarter as the company ramps up Blackwell chip production. Still, she thinks the gross margins will bounce back after. Even once Nvidia isn't as stressed over speeding up Blackwell, one analyst doesn't think the chip titan will be out of the woods. 3. Goldman wants to play by the rules as it drops DEI references. The bank toned down DEI language in its annual report, mentioning diversity much less than in previous years. The bank also said its "aspirational hiring goals" will expire this year without clarifying if new ones will be implemented. Goldman CEO David Solomon said the bank made the adjustments "to reflect developments in the law in the US." 1. xAI is training Grok in anti-wokeness. BI reviewed internal xAI documents outlining how AI tutors should "spot bias" and look out for "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in its chatbot Grok's responses. Tutors are told to consider the company's "guiding principles," which include "do not moralize, preach, or judge." Some workers said they felt the training methods prioritize right-wing beliefs, while a researcher said he believes Grok's approach can differentiate it from other chatbots. Check out some of the sample prompts and responses tutors were shown. 2. Googlers are using a Google Doc to track Google's layoffs. The tech giant cut jobs across its Cloud, ads, and Trust & Safety teams this week. It follows smaller, surgical cuts across the company over the past few months, employees said. In an effort to track the layoffs, current employees have circulated a crowdsourced Google Doc reviewed by BI. 3. An origin story for Amazon's robots revolutionalizing e-commerce. In 2015, Amazon hosted a competition challenging researchers to build robots that could identify and pick up specific warehouse items. A decade later, those ideas have helped launch a flock of advanced robots that could help the e-commerce giant save as much as $10 billion a year. 1. Rise of the Gen Z realtors. The share of realtors under 30 quadrupled in 2024, data shows, as the profession attracts more young people. Three Gen Z brokers told BI the profession helped them experience financial freedom and avoid slogging away at a typical desk job — even if their baby faces made it hard to get off the ground initially. 2. I just can't quit you, Netflix. The streaming giant isn't worried if you cancel your subscription — data from the analytics company Antenna suggests it'll probably win you back quickly. In 2023, 61% of subscribers who canceled were back on the platform within a year. That win-back rate far surpasses Netflix's streaming rivals' average of 45%. 3. These healthcare startups are ready for acquisitions this year. It's been a slow few years for company combinations in the healthcare startup industry. Nearly a dozen investors and bankers told BI few large companies seem willing to make big deals. The right buyers might be their peers — and seven healthcare startups appear ready to move.

Title: Fact-Checking Firm Logically Confirms Job Cuts in India As Cost-Cutting Measure

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Sources familiar with the matter stated that Logically, the British fact-checking company, has laid off approximately 8-10 individuals from its India team as part of its company-wide efforts.Â This is part of a larger global restructuring, with dozens of employees laid off as part of cost-cutting measures. Logically Indiaâs spokesperson confirmed the development. In a statement to MediaNama, they stated: âAt Logically, we continuously assess our business to ensure we are best positioned for long-term success in delivering on our mission to combat threats online. With recent new additions to our C-Suite and a transition to being a more product-led business, we have reflected on our company strategy, needs, and organisational structure and made the decision to streamline our operations globally across multiple areas of the business.âÂ The statement added that this decision does not relate to any editorial realignment. âThis decision was not taken lightly, and we are deeply grateful for the contributions of our departing colleagues,â it added.Â The company has operations in the UK, the US, and India and announced layoffs earlier this month, which impacted around 40 employees.Â The fact-checker’s investors include the Amazon Alexa Fund and Vitruvian Partners. The company also secured multi-million-pound government contracts to counter conspiracy theories and false health information online. This follows Metaâs new policy, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in January, which loosened restrictions on political speech and moved away from third-party fact-checking. Specifically, the platform intended to weaken restrictions on sensitive topics like immigration, gender, and gender identity, lift limits on political content, and adopt a community-driven fact-checking system similar to X (formerly Twitter). In India, the crowdsourced âCommunity Notesâ system has also raised concerns among local fact-checkers about their future, despite assurances that international partnerships will remain intact for now.

Google this week cut employees across several of its units, including Cloud, ad sales, and Trust & Safety. Google staffers have circulated an internal Google doc tracking company job cuts, crowdsourced from internal memos and employee testimonies. Employees say Google has been making rolling cuts over the past few months, though many were much smaller and more surgical than the large cuts Google made in January 2023. Across the tech industry, companies such as Amazon and Microsoft that conducted sweeping layoffs a few years ago have been making recurring smaller reductions. A Google spokesperson said fewer than 200 roles were affected across the teams mentioned in the document. "Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long-term success," the spokesperson said. "This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead." The crowdsourced document, reviewed by Business Insider, said that several teams were informed of cuts this week, including an unknown number of employees in Google's ad sales team for the Americas Large Customer Sales group, which serves the company's bigger advertising clients. The document cited a memo announcing that the cuts were made to streamline and reduce layers. The document also said that at least 25 people were cut from the Bard EngProd team, an engineering team for the Bard AI product, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. It said an unknown number of employees were cut from the Trust & Safety group, citing a memo describing some jobs as being "redeployed." A spokesperson said the company intended to grow the Trust & Safety team despite the latest eliminations. For most teams, the specific number of employees cut is unknown. Several teams within Google's Cloud unit also had job cuts this week, including the Threat Intelligence Group, Scaled Customer Engineering, Google Cloud Platform Support, Go-To-Market, and Looker groups, the document said. Bloomberg earlier reported some details of the Cloud layoffs. Within Google, employees have often crowdsourced documents to share information such as which teams got hit with job cuts or how much money employees of different levels and locations make. Employees at other tech companies, such as Amazon, have circulated similar crowdsourced documents to share information about job cuts. Last month, Google offered voluntary buyouts for staff in its Pixel hardware and Android division, BI previously reported. Have a tip?

Title: A new public policy agenda has a vision for “local news for the people”

What would a local media system that prioritizes working and middle classes over corporate profits and the interests of billionaires look like? A new public policy agenda released this week has some ideas. The Media Power Collaborative, which released its policy framework on Tuesday, describes itself as an organizing space for media workers and their allies in research, activism, and education. The collaborative grew out of a peer networking group — now known as the News Futures collective — and is part of the media reform group Free Press. If you remember the much-discussed Roadmap for Local News that argued that the future of local news is “civic information,” this is the same crowd. The local news industry, as Nieman Lab readers well know, has been devastated by ad revenue losses, layoffs, and profit-driven corporate ownership over the past couple of decades. Over that time, local newspapers have shrunk faster than a new crop of local news sites and nonprofit newsrooms have been able to grow. Through the policy agenda, policy tracker, and a new network of regional coalitions, the Media Power Collaborative wants to push the public policy conversation toward support for some of the more community-minded local media that’s emerged to fill that gap. RELATED ARTICLEThe future of local news is “civic information,” not “declining legacy systems,” says new reportLaura Hazard OwenFebruary 2, 2023There’s a lot of overlap between the Media Power Collaborative and organizations like Rebuild Local News, which has its own policy menu and legislation tracker, and other media industry groups. But unlike, say, the News Media Alliance — which replaced the Newspaper Association of America and primarily represents commercial news publishers — the Media Power Collaborative and its aligned groups are orientated around meeting local information needs. In some communities, that could mean supporting a local nonprofit newsroom or an independent civic-minded daily newspaper. In others, it might mean supporting someone who might not even call themselves a journalist but regularly covers school board meetings or local immigration raids. The Media Power Collaborative is more likely, in other words, to focus on local media ownership, civic information hubs, and public schools or libraries than returning legacy newspapers to 2005 staffing levels. Free Press often hears from local journalists and organizers who’ve been asked to support a specific bill or initiative being considered in their state or city. Mike Rispoli, senior director of journalism and civic information at Free Press, said local practitioners often want to engage in policy issues, but aren’t always confident in their ability to determine if their newsroom or civic media initiative stands to benefit. Rispoli also described the Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda as an attempt at longer-term thinking. “While I think things like tax credits can be important, we also know that’s a bridge proposal at best. I think what the MPC policy agenda is [asking] is, ‘What should we be building a bridge to? What is the actual thing that we want?'” Rispoli explained. “The end goal of these policies should be more informed communities, more engaged communities, and — as a byproduct of that — supporting news and its production.” The Media Power Collaborative agenda highlights local news and information as a public good that deserves “robust public funding” whether it comes from a legacy newsroom or not. From the report: Just like safe roads and strong public-education systems, public-service journalism and civic information are public goods that benefit entire communities. Unfortunately, the market is critically underproducing these public goods: Estimates of what it would cost annually to bridge current community-information gaps range from $1 billion to $10 billion or more. Even with promising new philanthropic investments in local news and civic media, public funding is essential to addressing a deficit of this magnitude and building toward a community-centered local-news system. The agenda also reflects a widespread frustration with public policy proposals that would benefit legacy newspaper chain owners such as Alden Global Capital. This has been a consistent theme for civic information advocates though by no means limited to them. “Corporate media and hedge funds and broadcasters — these are folks who have the ears of lawmakers. They have resources to lobby. And so every starting place in the conversations about media policy is something that protects their interests,” Rispoli said. “A bit of it is saying this [civic media] part of the field deserves a seat at the table. But a bit of it is saying we should be the ones setting the table.” RELATED ARTICLEThe scale of local news destruction in Gannett’s markets is astonishingJoshua BentonMarch 9, 2023Some of these corporate owners have gutted local newsrooms, Rispoli noted, and yet they’re “the ones at the front of the line with their hand out, saying, ‘we should be getting money from the government.'” The agenda attempts to address some of the biggest questions in local news policy, including how to protect editorial independence; which local news orgs should qualify for assistance; and, given finite public funding, which communities should be prioritized. Limiting public funds to legacy news organizations does not address their history of underserving communities of color as well as rural and low-income groups. It seems more likely to reinforce existing news deserts and information gaps. Candice Fortman, a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford and former executive director of Outlier Media, was one of the 10 members that met over the course of 2024 to craft the public policy agenda. “Many minds are working to build the agenda for the future of local news and how we will protect and fund reporting,” Fortman said. “This initiative, however, is about more than just saving local news; it’s about rebuilding it in a way that is equitable, sustainable, and deeply rooted in community needs.” The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda calls for “a transformed media system” that is “backed by robust public funding with sturdy firewalls in place to preserve editorial independence.” Some of the specific proposals include: The full agenda is here. No one is saying any of this will be easy. Those estimates for closing the local news gap are enormous and it’s unlikely public funding alone is the answer. There are also important and fair questions about editorial independence and giving anyone — never mind the government — the power to decide which journalists and news organizations will receive taxpayer dollars. Perhaps more pressingly, though, is that although majorities of both Democrats and Republicans approve of local media, the political polarization and harsh rhetoric at the national level has trickled down to state and local policy conversations. Funding for public media — already lower in the U.S. than in many other democracies — is under threat. Even paid news subscriptions for government workers have been criticized and exploited for political purposes in recent weeks. Federal legislation seems off the table for now, and we’ll have to see how many states and cities will see proposals to support local news become law. I noted one other ominous sign. The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda mentions that research tells us low-income communities, communities of color, immigrant communities, and rural communities are the most underserved by our current local media system. The report includes a link to research published by the FCC. The report, which was live in late December, now shows a “page not found” error message.

Title: Musk, DOGE, and the AI-fueled Plot to Fire Everybody

What is DOGE? Officially, it’s the “Department of Government Efficiency,” intended to find and eliminate government fraud and waste; officially, it’s also a joke, named after an old meme. DOGE doesn’t just emit mixed signals — the incoherent messaging is right there in the name. It’s part of the plan and, for supporters, part of the fun. When necessary, the government argues that what DOGE is doing is just common sense, that Elon Musk is spearheading a “comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,” and that the administration has a “commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce.” Nearly as often, though, the mask slips or gets pulled off and thrown on the ground: This isn’t true, not that we’re engaged in any meaningful sort of collective debate over facts here: According to polling, a majority of Americans think that Musk has too much power in government and share a negative view of DOGE. It’s not pure MAGA polarization, either — the public views Musk less favorably than it views President Trump. You may grant, if you insist, a genuine desire to find and eliminate inefficiencies in the federal government, but Musk and his supporters are barely trying to hide other animating impulses here. The immense contempt they have for federal workers; the immense contempt they feel for the courts or anyone else who might slow their efforts to fire said federal workers; the zealous energy they bring to cutting as many people as possible; and the willingness to make things up, or to refuse to correct falsehoods, in pursuit of a nakedly ideological project and of power more generally. Musk, who is arguably the second-most-powerful person in government, and the most successful capitalist in America, officially has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” according to White House lawyers, but his constant (and constantly heeded) posts betray both his functional position and the minimum bound of his ambitions. Specifically, he wants to fire as many people as possible. Punishing workers is a cause and a purpose unto itself, inseparable from a grandiose conflation of personal desires and successes with the fate of humanity. It’s an ecstatic project with an accelerationist character. “I am become meme,” he declares, as his team of private-sector loyalists harasses federal employees with spiteful emails threatening to get rid of them. The message from the largest employer in the country to its disfavored employees could not be much clearer: You are waste, you are fraud. We want to make a spectacle of your misfortune. We cannot wait to fire you. DOGE is certainly helping to achieve — to quote the words of Project 2025 author and new director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought — the goal of putting federal workers “in trauma” and casting them as “the villains.” But Musk is more than a willing mercenary for someone else’s project, and his stature and influence within and outside the government imbues his slash-and-burn campaign with greater significance. Within the scope of DOGE, Musk is playing the role of government auditor and contractor, which is conflict enough. But he’s also a singular industrialist with multiple companies devoted to automation, a history of executing brutal and punitive firings, and a proudly hostile stance toward organized labor and regulation. Most relevant, however, is his longtime obsession with what he sees as the mother of all technologies. He’s an AI guy. This might explain why DOGE’s flamboyant and unprecedented performance feels both familiar and unsettling beyond the government workforce. We’re committing all of our time and resources to eliminating your job, and by the way, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. We’re chasing inconceivable power, and you might end up as collateral damage. We’re making a new world, and this is our only chance to get it right. We’re trying to fire you. This is how MAGA Republicans talk about the political moment. It’s also how America’s premier industry sounds when it’s talking about AI. Most other tech executives aren’t openly fantasizing about detaching employee “parasites” from their hosts, but some get closer than others. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg recently announced layoffs explicitly targeting “low performers,” which many at the company saw as a pointed and unnecessarily damaging way to cut costs, adding insult to injury and damaging prospects for former employees. The layoffs came in the context of a larger attempt at an ideological pivot for the company, marked by Zuckerberg’s interview with Joe Rogan (and following Musk’s mass-layoff trial run at Twitter, about which Zuckerberg, and other corporate leaders, had publicly expressed envy). They also came in the context of the company’s massive planned investment in AI, which Zuckerberg talked about on the show. “Probably, in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” he told Rogan. (He softened the implication by suggesting that AI would simply free people up to work on more interesting problems, but the comments reverberated, as intended, through the tech industry.) More commonly, AI executives talk about work and labor in general. In a recent blog post, OpenAI founder Sam Altman made his case for mass automation. “Imagine AI as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual co-worker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work,” he wrote. He suggested, with an optimistic gloss, that “huge” changes are coming: “We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today.” In AI, we’re getting some mixed messages too — the people working on this stuff are excited but worried. Founders and CEOs talk about glorious abundance with the public and tease concentrated returns to investors. They muse about automation and the future of work, raise alarms, fund alignment research, and talk about existential risk. Altman, for his part, has commissioned research into the plausibility and effects of UBI for a post-AI world. A bit like DOGE, however, OpenAI’s conflicted identity is embodied in its name and concept. The company was a nonprofit with the mission to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” By 2019, it was teaming up with Microsoft to raise tens of billions of dollars. Now, it’s in the process of converting into a for-profit company. Just as DOGE is pursuing something more than simple increases in efficiency, AI firms are pitching something more than simple increases in productivity. The gap between the industry’s coy, delicate rhetoric around automation in some contexts — oh, maybe we’ll need UBI, ha-ha, er, well, it’ll be a lot of change very fast, but it’ll work out maybe, eh, maybe regulate us? — and its far less conflicted pitch to investors is not lost on people whose jobs might be defined as “knowledge work,” nor is its fervor as expressed in sheer dollar amounts. “Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft intend to spend as much as $320 billion combined on AI technologies and data-center build-outs in 2025,” reports CNBC, a level of investment for which observers have struggled to find comparison (although here’s one from The Information: “Big Tech’s Capex Gusher Tops Last Oil Spree,” a.k.a. the shale boom). Many of the largest and most visible companies in the economy, in other words, are working toward the same goal, collectively marshaling a level of resources otherwise associated with national infrastructure projects or wars. You can characterize their goals and corresponding long-term outcomes in a wide range of ways, but if you live anywhere downstream from their project, the message, again, is pretty clear, albeit with a few more apologies and caveats appended as necessary, delivered with polite contrition rather than foaming zeal: We’re sorry, but we have no choice but to do everything in our power to replace you with machines. New polling from Pew suggests that this message is being heard, and the Zuckerbergian appeals to the history of automation — that maybe it will create more, better jobs in the long term, after periods of transitional pain — aren’t resonating. According to a Pew survey of American workers, 52 percent are “worried about the future impact of AI use in the workplace,” while 32 percent “think it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run.” Though 36 percent “feel hopeful” about how AI might be used at work, 33 percent are “overwhelmed,” while just 6 percent believe it will lead to more job opportunities in the long run. The parallels between DOGE’s all-or-nothing bet that it can purge the federal government and the AI industry’s promise to purge humans from wide swaths of the existing private workforce are united in the figure of Musk, a former partner in OpenAI who now runs his own AI firms; to him, the projects are clearly connected, synergistic, and mutually necessary. He’s making this fairly explicit! DOGE is claiming, with few details, to use AI to further its missions, however you might interpret them: AI to replace government work; AI to arbitrarily fire people with a sheen of analysis; “AI” wielded as a broader demoralizing force or conveniently summoned threat to workers. There are intentional and unintentional aspects of his leadership at DOGE that, if nothing else, clarify the beliefs he’s enacting and seem to hold. Perhaps most of the government shouldn’t exist, and someone like Musk should run what’s left of it. Perhaps most jobs shouldn’t exist, or at least inevitably won’t, so why wait around? Perhaps employees who wish to have jobs should be reminded to do as they’re told. It can be hard to call a moment or define an era without the benefit of hindsight, and tipping points tend to reveal themselves in retrospect. As top-down attempts to impose and manifest a different world go, though, this is almost parodically blunt stuff. The president is a guy who rose to national fame firing people from fake jobs on a TV show. His publicly unhinged billionaire quasi-co-president is a man who appears to believe that most government jobs are fake, and who has been deputized to eliminate as many of them as possible. Like many of his peers in private industry, this same guy talks in urgent and increasingly dire terms about winning the race to build human-level and maybe superhuman AI, a project into which the tech giants are sinking the hundreds of billions of dollars in cash they’ve harvested from their users over the last decade. Whatever you think of its chances of succeeding, and whatever you think would come out of the other side in the long term, their fundraising resembles a bet on, at minimum, short-to-medium-term mass displacement in segments of the economy that were until recently understood as relatively safe. In fuller expression, it’s not just a post-worker vision, it verges on post-human. To anyone who isn’t invested in these outcomes, either literally or ideologically, it’s an unsettling wager. In Trump, Musk, and Silicon Valley’s speculative CEOs — whose musings and strategies are certainly being heard and nervously interpreted by leaders across various potentially disruptable industries — America is living under a nightmare boss trifecta, each potentially familiar to different workers in their own way. There’s the one who wants to fire you for disloyalty, the one who wants to fire you because he thinks you’re undeserving and less than, and the one who grimaces through the PIPs and the RIFs but lights up during the earnings calls. The news can, at times, resemble a Zoom call from hell, with Americans on mute as management talks through plans for getting rid of them. It’s layoff morning in America. These parallels also extend into an unknown future. It’s increasingly clear that Musk and Trump have ambitions for DOGE that extend beyond cuts and into meta-governmental control. It represents, in other words, an all-or-nothing bet on remaking, destroying, or perhaps controlling the government, with a massive potential upside for those involved and correspondingly large risk if they fail. Big tech’s push into AI is similarly high stakes, with firms both excited about possible returns but also fearful of getting stuck on the wrong side of a massive reallocation of power. A superpower freed of its opposition and a superintelligence freed of its labor force are versions of the same fantasy in which absolute power is seized, or obtained, through different means. These expressions of absolute self-belief shouldn’t be confused with inevitability, of course, nor, should they come up short of counterrevolution and post-human superintelligence, respectively, will their almost unbelievable nakedness be forgotten. (A pressing question about both is whether they’re accelerating toward a lasting new status quo, ramping like a manic episode, or a little bit of each. Either way, they have the potential to be widely galvanizing.) Given overlapping once-in-a-generation opportunities, America’s most empowered and resentful bosses have converged on the same simple plan: laying everyone off.

Choose your location By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it’s done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Although Salesforce swabbed mention of its diversity targets in its 2023 10-K filing, it still released a 2024 “equality update.” In that update, the company reiterated its commitment to diverse representation and how much more it still needs to achieve. In a conversation with Axios recently, CEO Marc Benioff said he would stand by his employees amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI orders. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Choose your location By Adam Nichols, Amid Elon Musk’s whirlwind campaign to cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in government services in the name of efficiency, a bombshell report Wednesday revealed a staggering amount of taxpayer cash that goes directly to him. The richest man in the world is one of the biggest earners paid from public money, the Washington Post found . A deep dive into government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits found the South African billionaire has reaped $38 billion dollars of government cash. Want more breaking political news? Click for the latest headlines at Raw Story. The Post reported the payments started more than 20 years ago, as Musk secured a low-interest loan from the Energy Department as CEO of the then-struggling Tesla. That department is one of many now hit by mass layoffs and cuts led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The Post spoke to unnamed sources from inside the government to back up its story. Almost two-thirds of the cash came in the past five years, according to the report. Just last year, at least $6.3 billion was committed to Musk’s companies. They included cash to build a Tesla factory and NASA contracts to his company SpaceX to aid the moon program. ALSO READ: Elon Musk's DOGE boys think this is a video game as Trump plots his 2nd coup “The total amount is probably larger: This analysis includes only publicly available contracts , omitting classified defense and intelligence work for the federal government,” the Post reported. It went on, “The Post found nearly a dozen other local grants, reimbursements and tax credits where the specific amount of money is not public.” The report also found 52 contracts with seven government agencies that are set to pay another $111.8 billion over the next few years. All seven agencies have come under DOGE's microscope. While Musk is not a paid government employee, he was a massive funder of now-President Donald Trump’s election campaign and is now a central part of his advisory team. He also heads DOGE, which he claims will slash trillions of dollars in government waste. Musks’s part in the Trump administration has raised many red flags among onlookers about major conflicts of interest. “Not every entrepreneur at this scale has been this dependent on federal money — certainly not Nvidia, not Microsoft, nor Amazon, nor Meta,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. Federal workers fired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency may find their professional futures lay in blue states where Democratic governors are rolling out the welcome mat, NBC News reported. "In light of the thousands of federal job cuts doled out by President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk via the Department of Government Efficiency, a growing number of governors, mostly Democrats, have begun trying to woo those employees to apply for state government jobs. Others have promoted private sector opportunities and other resources available for those who are newly i... A new report from Rolling Stone claims that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is taking a wrecking ball to the Social Security Administration, which could seriously hurt beneficiaries' ability to collect the money they are owed. According to the report, DOGE has already "shuttered at least 10 Social Security field offices in as many states" and "has eliminated the SSA’s Office of Transformation, a department whose work included making it easier for Americans to apply for and access benefits online — the exact service many people will need now that offices are being closed across ... Elon Musk let slip that his Department of Government Efficiency accidentally canceled Ebola prevention when the tech billionaire cut funding to the United States Agency for International Development. The tech billionaire spoke at Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting Wednesday, where he discussed DOGE's cuts to the federal workforce. He conceded that his team would likely make mistakes, but pledged to quickly correct them as he seeks to dramatically reduce the federal budget. "We will make mistakes," he told the Cabinet. "We won't be perfect, but when we make a mistake, we'll fix it very quickl...

A clip from a recent episode of Family Feud got fans of the show talking. Almost all of Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's (R-FL) staff has reportedly turned over during her time in office because of "nightmare" working conditions. Multiple sources told The Daily's Beast's Juliegrace Brufke that "punitive" and "toxic work culture" were to blame for "nearly 100 percent turnover." Brufke described the situation as a "mass exodus" on X. The sources said that only one of the staffers who started with Luna in January had not quit their job. People familiar with the matter described "walking on eggshells" and said, "Anyone could be fired at any time." Want more breaking political n...

The Trump administration has indicated it may target the food stamp program, also known as SNAP, for deep budget cuts. It also may strengthen the work requirement for SNAP. Many SNAP recipients are already required to work, especially those who are able bodied and under the age of 54. “If you are age 16 to 54 and able to work, you will probably need to meet the general work requirements to get SNAP benefits,” according to the SNAP website. “The general work requirements include registering for work, participating in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by your state SNAP agency, taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing your work hours below 30 a week without a good reason.” AlamogordoTownNews.org reports that an Inspector General's report has been released concerning an incident involving Air Force Major General Christopher Finerty.

Marine Corps veteran Joshua Stueve, a high-ranking Justice Department spokesman, resigned this week and accused the new Trump administration of creating a "hostile and toxic work environment." In a letter posted by NBC's Ryan Reilly on Bluesky, Stueve said the outcome of the 2024 election did not sway his decision.

Li has raised eyebrows from political observers in recent months, many of whom have noted that she was an outspoken, down-the-line partisan Democrat throughout the election and even attacked anyone who criticized President Joe Biden'... On Sunday, thousands in Los Angeles stood in solidarity with the city’s immigrant community. Together, demonstrators of all ages protested Trump’s ongoing threats of mass deportations that would directly impact large groups of people in the city and surrounding L.A. County. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced, February 27, a new plan to supercharge the hiring of air traffic controllers (ATC), aiming to attract 'more of America’s best and brightest to the aviation safety community.’ A federal judge denied, on February 18, the request by a coalition of 14 states, including California, for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Mountain View By Adam Nichols, Amid Elon Musk’s whirlwind campaign to cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in government services in the name of efficiency, a bombshell report Wednesday revealed a staggering amount of taxpayer cash that goes directly to him. The richest man in the world is one of the biggest earners paid from public money, the Washington Post found . A deep dive into government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits found the South African billionaire has reaped $38 billion dollars of government cash. Want more breaking political news? Click for the latest headlines at Raw Story. The Post reported the payments started more than 20 years ago, as Musk secured a low-interest loan from the Energy Department as CEO of the then-struggling Tesla. That department is one of many now hit by mass layoffs and cuts led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The Post spoke to unnamed sources from inside the government to back up its story. Almost two-thirds of the cash came in the past five years, according to the report. Just last year, at least $6.3 billion was committed to Musk’s companies. They included cash to build a Tesla factory and NASA contracts to his company SpaceX to aid the moon program. ALSO READ: Elon Musk's DOGE boys think this is a video game as Trump plots his 2nd coup “The total amount is probably larger: This analysis includes only publicly available contracts , omitting classified defense and intelligence work for the federal government,” the Post reported. It went on, “The Post found nearly a dozen other local grants, reimbursements and tax credits where the specific amount of money is not public.” The report also found 52 contracts with seven government agencies that are set to pay another $111.8 billion over the next few years. All seven agencies have come under DOGE's microscope. While Musk is not a paid government employee, he was a massive funder of now-President Donald Trump’s election campaign and is now a central part of his advisory team. He also heads DOGE, which he claims will slash trillions of dollars in government waste. Musks’s part in the Trump administration has raised many red flags among onlookers about major conflicts of interest. “Not every entrepreneur at this scale has been this dependent on federal money — certainly not Nvidia, not Microsoft, nor Amazon, nor Meta,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. Federal workers fired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency may find their professional futures lay in blue states where Democratic governors are rolling out the welcome mat, NBC News reported. "In light of the thousands of federal job cuts doled out by President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk via the Department of Government Efficiency, a growing number of governors, mostly Democrats, have begun trying to woo those employees to apply for state government jobs. Others have promoted private sector opportunities and other resources available for those who are newly i... A new report from Rolling Stone claims that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is taking a wrecking ball to the Social Security Administration, which could seriously hurt beneficiaries' ability to collect the money they are owed. According to the report, DOGE has already "shuttered at least 10 Social Security field offices in as many states" and "has eliminated the SSA’s Office of Transformation, a department whose work included making it easier for Americans to apply for and access benefits online — the exact service many people will need now that offices are being closed across ... Elon Musk let slip that his Department of Government Efficiency accidentally canceled Ebola prevention when the tech billionaire cut funding to the United States Agency for International Development. The tech billionaire spoke at Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting Wednesday, where he discussed DOGE's cuts to the federal workforce. He conceded that his team would likely make mistakes, but pledged to quickly correct them as he seeks to dramatically reduce the federal budget. "We will make mistakes," he told the Cabinet. "We won't be perfect, but when we make a mistake, we'll fix it very quickl... Family Feud viewers have complained that producers have gotten “desperate” when choosing families to participate in the game show. A clip from a recent episode of Family Feud got fans of the show talking. Almost all of Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's (R-FL) staff has reportedly turned over during her time in office because of "nightmare" working conditions. Multiple sources told The Daily's Beast's Juliegrace Brufke that "punitive" and "toxic work culture" were to blame for "nearly 100 percent turnover." Brufke described the situation as a "mass exodus" on X. The sources said that only one of the staffers who started with Luna in January had not quit their job. People familiar with the matter described "walking on eggshells" and said, "Anyone could be fired at any time." Want more breaking political n... Tech billionaire and advisor to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk said that he “Will check with the President” on a $5,000 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dividend for every American taxpayer. Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan continue to have fun with their jokes and jabs at one another during Good Morning America. A recent GMA episode featured Robin calling out Michael after he shared a random thought with his co-stars during live television. President Donald Trump's interference with the Veterans Health Administration is having real and dire consequences, despite the administration's claims to the contrary, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. Trump has already had to reverse multiple cuts to the VA after public outcry, including the termination of 875 contracts that included cancer coverage, burial services for veterans, and doctor recruitment. Nonetheless, they are moving forward with a round of layoffs of people they claim are nonessential. "Last time you were on the show, we talked about people in t... Addressing comments made by billionaire Elon Musk about his staffers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), MSNBC host Michael Steele bluntly stated, "He's full of crap." On Saturday morning, the MSNBC "The Weekend," co-host ran a clip of Donald Trump's chief adviser protesting attacks on his DOGE hires by claiming the sensitive and private data his people have been accessing is available to "thousands" of federal workers. During his appearance on Friday with podcaster Joe Rogan, Musk said, "Tens of thousands of federal employees that have access already to the system. Anyone from ... An Indiana Republican congresswoman who was born in Ukraine and immigrated to the United States 25 years ago jabbed the president of her birthplace following a shouting match with President Donald Trump.

"If you could give advice to President Trump right now about this minerals deal that's floating around, his desire that mirrors yours and mine to end the war, what a... One political analyst thinks judges are close to jailing people for contempt in the ongoing court battles over government funding cuts. U.S. District Court Judge Amir H. Ali ruled on Wednesday that he would not pause his order giving President Donald Trump's administration an 11:59 p.m. deadline that same day to pay invoices for foreign development funds for contracts completed before Feb. 13, Just Security and MSNBC legal analyst Adam Klasfeld said on Bluesky. Policy Professor Don Moynihan, at the Ford School, University of Michigan, commented that thus far, the "Trump administration broke th... Jacksonville sheriff’s officers have made 146 arrests since a new homeless law took effect in Florida to prohibit sleeping in public spaces. The Sheriff’s Office reported the number during a meeting Wednesday with City Council members including Ron Salem, chair of the council’s Finance Committee. The agency said it has given out 631 warnings since the new law began. The author used artificial intelligence in the crafting of this article.

A rural Michigan federal worker who reluctantly cast her 2024 presidential vote for Donald Trump because she believed his promises about lowering the cost of living has now found herself out of a job she loved. In a Washington Post profile, 24-year-old Ryleigh Cooper detailed her difficult decision to vote for the man who, just three months after the election, would dash her hopes and dreams of a career in forestry and the ability to access IVF for a child she badly wanted. "Trump, at a campaign stop an hour and a half south of her, had promised to make IVF free. She knew that from a video cli... Representatives from the Denver Zoo attended the Land Use, Transportation, and Infrastructure Committee of the Denver City Council on Tuesday. They made a pitch for eliminating lower admission fees in the winter after this season. The committee agreed to the change. The fee structure still must be approved by the full council. The Trump administration has indicated it may target the food stamp program, also known as SNAP, for deep budget cuts. It also may strengthen the work requirement for SNAP. Many SNAP recipients are already required to work, especially those who are able bodied and under the age of 54. “If you are age 16 to 54 and able to work, you will probably need to meet the general work requirements to get SNAP benefits,” according to the SNAP website. “The general work requirements include registering for work, participating in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by your state SNAP agency, taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing your work hours below 30 a week without a good reason.” AlamogordoTownNews.org reports that an Inspector General's report has been released concerning an incident involving Air Force Major General Christopher Finerty. Now retired, Major General Christopher Finerty was stripped of a star after an inspector general investigation found he engaged in multiple inappropriate relationships; including with an enlisted airman and congressional staffers and had an affair with a married woman, each violations of military codes of conduct. Prior to Donald Trump and J.D. Vance ganging up and demanding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky thank them in a contentious and ugly Oval Office press availability, the boyfriend of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) harangued the leader of the war-torn nation for not wearing a suit. In a video posted to Bluesky, Brian Glenn, who reports for fringe conservative site Real America's Voice, demanded of the Ukrainian leader, "Do you — why don't you wear a suit?"

CALIFORNIA – California attorney general Rob Bonta warned federal employees, February 3, about the Trump Administration’s “deferred resignation” program. The program purports to offer federal employees pay through September 30, 2025, if they resign by February 6, 2025.

In a Friday letter posted on the Department of Government Efficiency — or DOGE — X account , the Department of Education threatened to remove federal funding from public education institutions if the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives isn’t achieved by the end of the month. Homeless shelters intended to serve people on an interim basis should accept just about everyone, including criminals, offer services in other languages and not require identification, according to ideas posed this week by people who work with unhoused neighbors in communities nationwide. Marine Corps veteran Joshua Stueve, a high-ranking Justice Department spokesman, resigned this week and accused the new Trump administration of creating a "hostile and toxic work environment." In a letter posted by NBC's Ryan Reilly on Bluesky, Stueve said the outcome of the 2024 election did not sway his decision. "In fact, it has been an honor to serve this department under multiple administrations led by both Republicans and Democrats, each of whom have previously treated career staff with respect and dignity. It is heartbreaking to see that basic decency come to an end," he wrote. Want mor... Former Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison took to X on Wednesday to unload on Lindy Li, a former Democratic Party donor who in recent months has taken to making the rounds on right-wing cable networks, proclaiming herself sympathetic to President Donald Trump and calling the Democratic Party a "cult" of failures who refused to heed her warnings. Li has raised eyebrows from political observers in recent months, many of whom have noted that she was an outspoken, down-the-line partisan Democrat throughout the election and even attacked anyone who criticized President Joe Biden'... Former Republican Party chairman Michael Steele blasted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) for her ignorance of basic government functionality. Greene presides over a subcommittee created to handle the Donald Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The initiative was then handed over to billionaire Elon Musk to cut as much as $2 trillion from government spending. The result has been a massive purge of government staff outside Washington. Greene's committee met on Wednesday, where she painted the mass firings as part of stopping the "waste, fraud and abuse" of funding. Want mo... On Sunday, thousands in Los Angeles stood in solidarity with the city’s immigrant community.

Duffy announced, February 27, a new plan to supercharge the hiring of air traffic controllers (ATC), aiming to attract 'more of America’s best and brightest to the aviation safety community.’ A federal judge denied, on February 18, the request by a coalition of 14 states, including California, for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). CALIFORNIA – A group of Danish citizens have gathered almost 200,000 signatures for their petition to “Buy California.’ The satirical campaign is in response to President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire Greenland.

Mountain View By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Melly Barajas is known as the “queen of tequila.” The 60-year-old founder and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico was an aspiring fashion designer when her father planted the idea of owning a tequila brand in her head. As she started learning everything she could about making tequila, she was often the only woman in the room. In the 25 years since Leyenda’s founding as one of the first female-owned tequila companies, it has expanded to produce 20,000 liters of tequila daily. Barajas, who was recently named to the Forbes 50 Over 50: Global list, runs an all-female operation. “I really think this industry needed the female touch,” she told Forbes’ Maria Gracia Santillana Linares. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The House approved a budget resolution Tuesday that lays the framework for President Donald Trump's agenda, the first major test of the new Congress. The plan calls for $2 trillion in overall spending cuts over the next decade, extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosts defense spending. Trump told reporters Tuesday his administration plans to sell a “gold card” for $5 million that will provide wealthy non-citizens U.S. residency and a route to citizenship, an announcement that comes as he spearheads a mass deportation initiative. He said the card will give buyers the same privileges as green card holders, who have permanent residency and work authorizations in the U.S. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Tesla’s share price fell more than 8% Tuesday following reports that the company’s sales across Europe dropped by about 45% over the last month—despite rival electric-vehicle companies seeing increased demand. The losses caused CEO Elon Musk’s net worth to plummet by almost $15 billion, as his role in the Trump Administration weighs on shares, according to one analyst. Investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s Wednesday’s earnings report, which will provide early indications of how it will emerge following the release of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China. Ahead of the report, the AI giant’s stock fell 2.8% Tuesday, amid a broader pullback of tech stocks. At least 21 former staffers of the U.S. Digital Service, which was renamed the Department of Government Efficiency in a takeover by President Donald Trump, resigned Tuesday. The anonymous staffers wrote in a letter that they would not “use our skills as technologists” to “compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” Donald Trump Jr. made $813,000 in 2024 as a director of Trump Media & Technology Group—roughly a quarter of the company’s annual revenue—despite attending just two of the board’s five meetings, according to an SEC filing. Trump Jr. controls 52% of the outstanding shares of the parent company of Truth Social, as the sole trustee of his father’s revocable trust. AFP/Getty Images Ukraine reportedly agreed Tuesday to partner with the U.S. on a mineral development deal, possibly mending a contentious relationship between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Trump seeks a ceasefire with Russia. The deal involves Ukraine and the U.S. jointly developing Ukrainian minerals, oil and gas, according to Bloomberg, which noted the agreement does not include security guarantees for Ukraine. A growing coalition of Republicans are starting to speak out against DOGE and its mass layoffs across the federal workforce, including Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, and Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick. Several Republicans have been confronted by constituents about DOGE at recent town halls, though President Donald Trump has insisted Americans “like the job that Elon is doing.” MORE: White House officials confirmed that Amy Gleason, a longtime healthcare technology executive, is now the acting administrator of DOGE, following weeks of speculation over whether Elon Musk was officially in charge. Gleason previously worked in the U.S. Digital Service during Trump’s first term. BondIt cofounders Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor TOPLINE For decades, taking big swings on ambitious independent film projects has been a seductive and highly risky investment strategy in Hollywood. Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony will celebrate the best of these success stories, but each year there are many more fortunes lost than trophies won. BondIt has differentiated itself since its founding in 2013 by lowering the risk, attracting institutional money and providing more dependable returns with its low stakes, high volume approach on movies that will never score millions at the box office or contend for Oscars. The company does have one nomination, but the vast majority of the 500-plus films BondIt has financed are the types of low-budget genre flicks that skip theatres and go straight to streaming services and TV networks across the world. The company builds its loans against predictable, projectable returns, such as the money a production receives back in tax credits for filming in a certain state or country, or its pre-sales in international markets. Other factors are less black-and-white, like a filmmakers’ ability to deliver a movie on time, the quality of the project’s sales team and how much equity capital has already been raised. BondIt movies might be less glamorous, but they deliver consistent returns. In any given 12-month window, BondIt invests in 50 or more films and turns over more than $100 million in capital—a metric the company measures as its revenue—writing off less than 1% in bad loans and delivering 15-20% returns. WHY IT MATTERS “In a time where movie studios and streamers are contracting and looking to cut costs, it would seem like there's a place in the entertainment industry for more independents to break through,” says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. “The only problem—independent movies are historically a very risky business. If BondIt can prove otherwise, it may be able to attract big institutional money to the space, and fund the kinds of movies that the studios no longer make.” MORE Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television Starbucks has had its ups and downs, but lately, it’s been mostly downs, as the company reported basically flat 2024 revenues and announced 1,100 corporate job cuts Monday. The company’s brand reputation is also declining, data shows: 4%: Starbucks’ decline in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2025 No. 45: The coffee chain’s ranking in a recent Brand Finance report of the most valuable global brands, plunging from No. 15 in 2024 57.7: The number of points Starbucks’ reputation had on a 100-point index, declining from 71.5 points in 2021, according to Reptrak If you’re networking but still not landing job offers, that could be because you’re not meeting with the right people. While it’s important to network with employees at all levels, be sure to focus on the gatekeepers who influence or make hiring decisions. Smart networking is also a numbers game: Companies aren’t always hiring, so try to keep in touch with hiring managers and you’ll be top of mind when an opportunity opens up. A consumer activist group is launching a grassroots campaign to boycott online and in-store spending Friday in an attempt to “take back control of our economy, government and future of our country.” It’s also planning specific protests against which of the following retailers? A. Nestlé B. Amazon C. Walmart D. All of the above Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

Wednesday, 26 Feb 2025 A demonstrator holds a poster displaying a prohibited traffic sign reading 'Musk DOGE' during a rally to protest President Trump's policies on Presidents Day on Feb 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. — AP WASHINGTON: More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Feb 25 from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk – not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernise Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardise Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,“ they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimise DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer – an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,“ Kamens said. US Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalised. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the US Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. – AP Thank you for your report!

Title: Readers told us that maybe DOGE's email request is a good idea
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-federal-workers-email-good-ideas-responses-poll-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:40:30Z
Full Content:
Katie Notopoulos, Senior Correspondent covering technology and culture On Monday, Business Insider asked readers what they'd do if they were suddenly asked to make a list of five things they accomplished at work last week — like DOGE asked federal workers to do. Nearly 120 readers responded, with a wide range of opinions. Only 18% of people said they wouldn't make the list at all. They'd accept that they might lose their job over their refusal. Some said they'd make the list, but begrudgingly. And nearly half of the people who replied said that not only would they willingly fill out the list of five accomplishments, but they'd do it with a smile and relish the chance to brag about their work. Clearly, the political tenor of the DOGE office and feelings about Elon Musk factored in. Quite a lot of the people who weren't his biggest fans had some colorful insults and invectives about the moonlighting Tesla CEO. "Stupidly childish and toxic" was one of the more safe-for-work critiques of DOGE's actions. Some people seemed excited by the idea that the "list five things" email could lead to cutting government waste. A recurring theme was that, while they didn't like the way DOGE was going about its work — which many said seemed insulting and threatening to workers — the idea of being expected to list out your weekly accomplishments is, indeed, a good idea. "I really don't hate it in theory as much as I distrust the people enacting this strategy," one reader wrote. Anthea Rowe, a communication coach who works with mid-career professionals, thought there was something good in the exercise. "We should all be prepared, at any time, to answer the question, 'What did you do last week?' And our answer shouldn't simply include a list of activities: 'I worked on search engine optimization for our website,'" Rowe wrote. "Instead, we should ideally report the outcomes we created last week: 'I increased visitors to the web pages of our priority products.'" (Rowe told me over email that she didn't endorse what DOGE is doing and that she's Canadian, so this isn't really her purview anyway.) Other people pointed out that a regular listing of duties and accomplishments is common for some in the private sector. Professionals such as lawyers or consultants who track billable hours for their clients are probably already doing this — as are some workers in industries like tech, where "stack ranking" for sorting people for layoffs is common. "I don't see what is wrong about your boss asking what did you do last week," one person said. "Federal employees are cuddled all their working career. They don't live in a real world where people get fired or laid off all the time. Why isn't the media acting the same way when Amazon or Microsoft laid off people this year? Wake up people, you need to work." Another also supported the request for an email list. "I submitted, and for 30+ years had my staff submit, a weekly activity report every Friday. It created high-performing organizations. Staff actually embraced it," the person said. "It was broadly viewed as management support and engagement. You never heard anyone say, 'My boss doesn't know what I do or doesn't help.' I cannot understand the resistance unless someone is trying to hide out somewhere." Chatting about this with coworkers, my boss' boss said she encourages people to keep a running "hype list" of their accomplishments so they can whip it out at review time. But, of course, that's under very different circumstances than what's happening right now with federal workers. As long-term career advice, keeping track of your accomplishments — in writing — and making sure your boss knows about them is probably a great thing. That's not what's happening at DOGE, where many workers find the gesture undermining and insulting instead of empowering. "Unfortunately, this isn't too different from what a lot of teachers are currently having to deal with," said Rachel Shearer, a middle school teacher. "We're constantly asked to show proof of what we are doing (both regarding our lessons and what we do outside our lessons, like contacting parents, documenting student behaviors). I think that this kind of micromanaging is extremely demoralizing and counterproductive; I do my best work when I know that I'm not constantly being watched and scrutinized." Ellen Predham, a former HR professional with more than 40 years of experience, said the issue was in the messaging. "I think the intent is fine, but the communication of this request was all wrong," she said. "Email should have come from Cabinet heads, not Musk, and definitely should not have said if you don't, you're resigning — a terrible way to communicate with folks." Still, if federal workers don't respond — and some departments have exempted their employees, even as Musk has extended the deadline — they could lose their jobs. Or at least that's the threat on the table. That's partly the point, one reader said. "How can a manager provide a meaningful performance review if they don't know what an employee is doing and their productivity?" asked the reader, a management consultant. "How would an organization determine sufficient staffing?" We might soon find out. Jump to

Twenty-one employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.

It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation. “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.” The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.

Thank you for stating the obvious, anonymous employees. This, of course, will do nothing to sway the opinion of the crazed Trump-lovers, but it's refreshing to see people with actual spines. as they should. breaking news: musk has compromised u.s. national security by taking segmented secure intelligence networks and exposed them to the internet. china, russia and others are having a field day. Who'd want to work for the world's worst douche? Others will gladly take their place, no big deal. So they were folded into DOGE from a different .gov agency. Good. Goodbye. Go Elon! “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. Best White House press secretary ever!! Who'd want to work for the world's worst douche? The approx. 3 MILLION people who work for the US government. Others will gladly take their place, no big deal. Well, that's true. Although most people are not willing to sell their soul and compromise their principles, there will always be those few who are greedy and corrupt enough to accept any money and power even if it breaks rules and goes against any ethical or moral code one might have. Yet, I have to commend these people who resigned from Musk's mafia. They can live with the fact that they didn't let themselves become corrupt and stayed away from hurting more people. Others will gladly take their place, no big deal. But I thought the idea was to downsize government. Why would you want others taking their place? Who'd want to work for the world's worst douche? The approx. 3 MILLION people who work for the US government. They had zero say in it. An unelected d head foisted upon the public service. At least you've admitted he's a douche though. Turns out you may know something, but certainly not all. I hope they changed the passwords on the way out. Others will gladly take their place, no big deal. But will they, though? I mean finding completely ignorant and craven people to work for Musk is very easy, but usually those people are also woefully unskilled. I don't think the Venn diagram of "competent people" vs "people willing to debase themselves for Musk/Trump" has that big of an overlap. Just look at the administration, it's over 90% of people who have no idea what they're doing. federal employees account for only 5% of the budget. saving 10% means only saving 1/2 of 1% of the budget. The media really trying to push the casual observer to think there was a mutiny with Musk’s own DOGE team. its just more Feds from USDS resigning- which is the goal. its just more Feds from USDS resigning- which is the goal. And what's the endgame, exactly? I mean we know it's not "saving money", because these cuts barely do a dent in the budget. So what it it? Rendering the country completely unable to function? What does anyone get from that? Never trust a man who dresses and behaves like a teenager. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” Well said Ladies and Gentleman, now go on and help the rest of the team RESIGN then shut this FEALTH DOWN. The media really trying to push the casual observer to think there was a mutiny with Musk’s own DOGE team. Who are the members of this DOGE team of ninja patriot warrior geeks anyway? Why the secrecy? Americans should just stop buying Musk's products then see what happens. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. You couldn't make this stuff up!! what's the endgame, exactly? Purge the bureaucracy of anyone who would defy the administration’s plan to dismantle constitutional democracy. it's not "saving money", because these cuts barely do a dent in the budget. Saving money. Millions per person in salary, benefits, costs and future lifetime pensions. What Trump and Musk don't understand is, the ones with principles are the most competent - because they rely solely on their abilities. The craven sycophants get by with flattery. They aren't competent. There will be a price to pay. Millions per person in salary, benefits, costs and future lifetime pensions. How many people need to be fired to pay for 18 holes of golf? Saving money. Unfortunately you can't manipulate numbers: these savings amount to close to nothing. Like it was pointed out, 1/2 of 1% of the budget. And you, of course, know it. I'm trying to have an actual discussion here, so try to answer seriously: what is the point of these cuts? federal employees account for 5% of the total budget. cutting 10% means a massive 1/2 of 1% of the budget. it’s not about saving money. it’s about distracting you from $3.7 trillion of tax cuts for the top 1%. I'm sad to hear of all the federal workers let go working in national parks. Many of them took those jobs even though they could've gotten more lucrative jobs in the private sector. Trump wants to turn those parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone into land for strip mining for oil and gas. It'll be sad to see such beautiful and wonderful places like those disappear. Purge the bureaucracy of anyone who would defy the administration’s plan Yeah that part too. As unelected officials, federal employees are supposed to be “apolitical”, serving each duly elected president and his agenda faithfully. But we sure are finding a lot of “apolitical” people doing liberal led “resistance” suddenly, aren’t we? Nobody is “dismantling critical public services.” Spending taxpayer money on transgender-theme comic books is not a "critical public service." Spending $12 million on a pickleball complex in Las Vegas is not a "critical public service." Funding "DEI" initiatives for bird-watching groups (yes, bird-watching) is not a "critical public service." Putting on circuses in public parks (part of the National Endowment for the Arts, which in itself is an entire waste of money) is not a "critical public service." Upkeeping and renovating entirely unused federal office space, which costs around $1 billion a year, is not a "critical public service." According to the General Accounting Office, the federal government loses $233 billion to $521 billion annually to fraud. The GAO also reported that during COVID, the government sent 1.1 million checks totaling $1.4 billion to dead people. None of that even comes close to qualifying as a "critical public service." I could go on and on and on and on. And on. But I suppose it was to be expected that Trump's haters would employ an attempt at emotional blackmail -- "he's going to cut vital funding and people will die!!!" -- to resist his much-needed efforts to rein in government waste and abuse. It only figures. serving each duly elected president and his agenda faithfully. Unless the president is breaking the law. Which he has done, is doing, and intends to do. Remember what our Emperor has said: "He who saves his Country violates no Law." liberal led “resistance” suddenly, aren’t we? Anything that is legal is not being resisted. --Purge the bureaucracy of anyone who would defy the administration’s plan Yeah that part too. You conveniently left off the end of my statement: "Purge the bureaucracy of anyone who would defy the administration’s plan to dismantle constitutional democracy." patkimToday 09:39 am JST I'm sad to hear of all the federal workers let go working in national parks. The National Park Service employs roughly 20,000 people. About 1,000 of them have been let go. So, please. Let's not paint this implied picture of "massive cuts in park service workers." Waste and inefficiency permeate the federal government. It's illogical and naive to believe that the National Park Service is somehow an exception. Many of them took those jobs even though they could've gotten more lucrative jobs in the private sector. That doesn't automatically immunize them from necessary cutbacks. I took a job teaching in Japan even though I could've, at least possibly, gotten more lucrative jobs with better benefits back home in America. That was my choice. And that doesn't automatically entitle me to keep my job no matter what. I can't help but notice the "federal worker first" mentality in your comment. As if holding them and their agencies accountable to certain expectations of efficiency and cost-effectiveness is somehow not allowed. Fight that clown.. Well, that's true. Although most people are not willing to sell their soul and compromise their principles, They’re not there will always be those few who are greedy and corrupt enough to accept any money and power even if it breaks rules and goes against any ethical or moral code one might have. And many more that are angry and distraught by what the Dems largely and the Feds have done with our money Yet, I have to commend these people who resigned from Musk's mafia. They can live with the fact that they didn't let themselves become corrupt and stayed away from hurting more people I prefer the ones that stayed on see this for what it is, Dems government mismanagement. Nothing more. Rather than take 5 or 10 minutes to compose an email listing, even only generally, what they've done at work ... ... at least some federal workers are now filing a lawsuit against Elon Musk. And that, friends, tells us all we need to know. I have no doubt that many federal workers are conscientious and work hard. But I also have no doubt that many are also unnecessary, are in jobs that do nothing whatsoever to benefit the American public to any great degree at all, and who frankly would go entirely unnoticed if their jobs were cut. It would have precious little, if any, impact on the average American's life. But now they're fighting tooth and nail to keep the "gravy train" going. Their reaction alone is more than enough indication that Trump and Musk are on the right track. Because if most government workers truly were "essential" and there wasn't any significant level of federal waste or financial abuse, Trump's and Musk's efforts would: (a) yield little resistance at all, and (b) go on pretty much unnoticed because, like a fire brigade showing up at a house that isn't burning, there'd be nothing for them to do. Unless the president is breaking the law. Which he has done, is doing, and intends to do. So far, he hasn’t this is why the Dems know they don’t have a leg to legally stand on indefinitely. Anything that is legal is not being resisted. I beg to differ. here, look at this shiny thing over here… don’t look at the budget. never mind that. Others will gladly take their place, no big deal. And this is why the trump administration is such an incompetent and ineffective disaster. All the competent people with experience will not work for him. So, we are left with the low hanging fruit loyalists, that are under qualified, the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel. Supervisor: "Please send me an email listing what you've done at work this past week." ....or else you are fired. DOGE isn't their 'supervisor'. They have actual 'supervisors'. Tell me what you did at school last week or I'm firing you. In fact, I'm firing you anyway. Clear out your desk. As unelected officials, federal employees are supposed to be “apolitical” So you are of course incensed that Musk is so clearly right-wing, right? And that Kash Patel has promised to go after democrats? Unless you're being a huge hypocrite? Some people have integrity. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter. Integrity. Admirably old school. Hope they find employment where ethics are actually taken into consideration. MAGA and Musk-world: Believing a small group of billionaires are suddenly working tirelessly for the benefit of the working class little guy requires a “huuuuge” level of stupidity… Elections have consequences. I wonder how many people who voted for Trump are regretting it now. Ironically, by quitting DOGE, they've done their job...Otsukare Sama desita! I wonder how many people who voted for Trump are regretting it now. as his polling keeps going up, almost none? Come on MAGA-fans, even you can see this obvious example of massive corruption... "The Federal Aviation Administration has agreed to use SpaceX’s Starlink internet system to upgrade the information technology networks it uses to manage US airspace, raising new concerns about conflicts of interest for CEO Elon Musk in one of his other roles, that of recommending funding cuts at federal agencies, including the FAA." https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/25/business/musk-faa-starlink-contract/index.html So Musk and Trump fire scores of air traffic controllers but award a multi-million dollar contract to Musk's Space-X? The MAGA corruption cesspool - in all its glory...and this is just the beginning... I wonder how many people who voted for Trump are regretting it now. The ones fired by DOGE for no reason certainly are regretting it, but they can definitely go eat a bag of something that I won't write. as his polling keeps going up, almost none? "Keeps going up", as defined by MAGA: January 25th: Favorable 46.7% Unfavorable 48.1% February 25th: Favorable 46.5% Unfavorable 48.1% unless you don’t understand how a duly elected President’s Cabinet and his advisers serve HIM. So Musk is just an adviser now? I thought he was the head of DOGE. No, wait, Trump said he wasn't the head of DOGE. Then why is he acting like he directs it while Trump sits in his chair looking bored?! Incompetence is confusing, isn't it? federal employees serve whoever is in the office. Supposedly “apolitically”. Exactly. So you're very angry that federal employee Kash Patel clearly has an agenda against democrats? Right? his polling keeps going up No, they're not. 42% support DOGE. 53% oppose it. One of these numbers is higher than the other. Trump's overall approval is down from a month ago, at 44%. You will find a way to dismiss this and other similar polls. *it's not I would argue that Doge firing people and then rehiring them is incredibly inefficient. Sounds like musk is the actual redundancy. Unless you're being a huge hypocrite? unless you don’t understand how a duly elected President’s Cabinet and his advisers serve HIM. That's a perfect example of the absolute failure of our education system - or perhaps someone failing basic Government class... Every government worker, to include the President, take an oath to support and uphold the Constitution... This "his cabinet serves him" bunk is something you'd hear in Moscow, Beijing, or Tehran... What do Trump and Musk think of our Vets? The folks who stepped up to serve their country and put their lives on the line? "VA fires 1,400 more staffers in second round of workforce reductions" https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2025/02/25/va-fires-1400-more-staffers-in-second-round-of-workforce-reductions/ So in addition to 1,000 employees fired early, we not get a total of 2400 VA cuts... I'm a Vet - I've used the VA for a variety of its services - mostly healthcare related. I'd encourage everyone to visit one - and see both the young and the old - who rely on the VA for their military-related health issues...

Title: Federal Tech Staffers Resign Rather Than Help Musk and DOGE

WASHINGTON — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. Read More: White House Says Musk Part of Trump’s ‘Unified Team’ as Agencies Undermine Him The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists, designers and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation. “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.” Read More: How Trump's Attacks on DEI Are Hurting Communities That Voted for Him Musk posted on his social media site X that the story was “fake news” and suggested that the staffers were “Dem political holdovers" who “would have been fired had they not resigned.” The staffers who resigned had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties were being integrated into DOGE. Their former office, the USDS, was established under President Barack Obama after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Read More: Elon Musk Draws Ire Telling Federal Employees to Justify Their Jobs Over Email or Resign According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Roughly one-third of the 65 staffers who remained at USDS quit on Tuesday rather than take on new duties under DOGE. Read More: Everyone Who's Resigned From the Trump Administration in Protest "We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services," they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. "This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. "I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans," Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Associated Press video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston.

Title: DOGE staffers offer group resignation in order to not ‘legitimise’ Musk

A group of 21 US federal workers issued a resignation letter saying DOGE risked compromising sensitive government data. A group of civil service employees in the United States have announced their resignation from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in the latest sign of discord within the administration of President Donald Trump. The 21 employees issued a joint letter to DOGE leadership, which was also obtained by media outlets including The Associated Press. In their statement on Tuesday, they accused DOGE of carrying out ideological attacks and risking the integrity of government systems. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the employees wrote. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The workers involved in the resignation included engineers, data scientists and product managers, all of whom were previously employed by top technology firms including Google and Amazon. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardise Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they explained. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimise DOGE’s actions.” The resignations are the latest fallout from Trump’s scorched-earth approach to downsizing and reshaping the federal workforce. Shortly after being elected to a second term in November, Trump tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee DOGE, a new panel whose purview was ambiguous. At first, it was not clear how DOGE would function: whether it would exist outside of government or within it, for example. Critics also pointed out that independent oversight agencies already existed to ensure government efficiency. But on his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order transforming the United States Digital Service — a preexisting office — into DOGE. The Digital Service was created in 2014 to address technology hurdles. Its formation had been prompted by the White House’s struggles to launch a medical insurance portal for Americans, as part of then-President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. The employees who resigned on Tuesday were part of the Digital Service before it became DOGE. They warned that their office had been visited by individuals wearing White House visitors’ passes, who interrogated employees about their political leanings and work experience. They also denounced the layoffs that have been visited upon the DOGE staff. Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off — a drastic cut, according to Tuesday’s resignation letter. The letter-writers warned that such sudden, steep declines in the workforce would undermine the White House’s ability to handle technology-based projects. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Only about 65 employees remained in the office after the February layoffs — and most were assigned to participate in the government downsizing DOGE has overseen. A third of that remaining group resigned on Tuesday. With responsibilities ranging from national security to intelligence gathering, healthcare to education, the federal government is the largest employer in the US. More than two million employees work in some capacity for the federal government, with thousands more — including in industries like agriculture and technology — reliant on government contracts. But upon taking office, Trump has moved swiftly to slash the employee base, which he has accused of harbouring “Biden bureaucrats”, a reference to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Many civil service members, however, are nonpartisan and help ensure the smooth functioning of the government across different administrations. Trump and Musk have also attempted to shutter whole agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was established under an act of Congress. That has, in turn, queued up a legal battle over the powers of the presidency. The mass layoffs and buyout offers have also sparked legal challenges from unions, states and individual employees, who argue their rights are being trampled. Experts have warned that Musk and Trump’s approach could have particularly devastating effects for individual citizens, who could see data mix-ups affect their day-to-day lives, from Social Security payments to the potential for privacy breaches. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk,” Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the US Department of Transportation, told The Associated Press. “But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that.” Already, fractures have started to emerge within the Trump White House — and even between the president and Musk himself. On Saturday, Musk had announced on his social media platform X that federal employees had until Monday to respond to an email with a five-point list describing their work over the past week. Failure to comply, he warned, would be understood as a resignation. But the backlash was swift, with labour unions and politicians denouncing the move as illegal. Some government agencies even told their staff to ignore Musk’s demand. By Monday, the Office of Personnel Management had announced to all departments and agencies that they could overlook the request without fear for their jobs. Some Republican lawmakers have also openly questioned Musk’s slash-and-burn approach. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, for instance, has criticised Musk’s firings as irresponsible and disrespectful to long-time government employees. “This is not how we treat any of our workforce. It’s not how we treat our federal employees. They deserve better,” she said at a town hall event last week. “You do not treat people in this manner who have been good public servants.” Murkowski also slammed Musk’s request for an emailed summary of federal workers’ achievements. ‘“Our public workforce deserves to be treated with dignity and respect for the unheralded jobs they perform,” she wrote in a post on X. “The absurd weekend email to justify their existence wasn’t it.” But Musk on Tuesday appeared to double down on his threats on Monday. “Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,” Musk wrote on X. “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) It’s the last week of Black History Month, and celebrations have been markedly muted this year. The month-long commemoration was first recognized in 1976 when President Gerald Ford established Black History Month to celebrate African American history and achievements in the United States. It’s been observed every February since. But this year, Black History Month comes in the midst of a larger national pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Businesses have been rolling back DEI initiatives for the last year due to pressure from conservative investors. And the pace of such rollbacks has increased since President Donald Trump took office. A number of government agencies said they will no longer celebrate identity-based observances like Black History Month, Pride Month and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and apps like Google Calendar have said they will no longer mark those observances across calendars. President Trump himself has signed a number of executive orders cutting back on DEI programming and funding, and has shifted employment policy at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to focus on “anti-American bias” instead of race or gender discrimination. That’s not to say the federal government has gone completely silent on Black History Month. Trump acknowledged the celebratory month in January, and hosted a reception honoring the occasion last week at the White House, despite his own executive orders rolling back DEI––parts of which a federal judge has blocked. And a number of businesses, like Apple and Costco, have doubled down on their commitment to protecting DEI programs. As Black History Month comes to an end and the U.S. continues its debate over DEI policies, support for Black history, businesses and employees should be year-round, writes contributor Julie Kratz.

News from the world of work Thousands of IRS workers were fired last week as we enter the heart of tax season, Kelly Phillips Erb reports. This comes after the agency recalled workers who had taken the government’s deferred resignation program offer earlier in the year, stating that certain “critical filing season positions” were exempt. While employees are increasingly less confident about their employer’s business outlook, CEO confidence is on the rise. According to a new report by The Conference Board, CEO confidence has surged to a three-year high, thanks to a stronger economic climate. The survey does, however, point to growing concerns about how mass deportations could impact the labor force. Elon Musk isn’t the only billionaire to have come into the United States through an immigrant visa. Here are the billionaires who benefited from H1-B visas to launch their careers (and wealth) in the U.S. Tech companies, led by Amazon, were awarded the most H1-B visas last year. DOGE continues to cut jobs across the federal government. Employees at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, FEMA, TSA and even the Department of Defense were recently laid off. The massive government layoffs are starting to worry Wall Street analysts. One prominent economist called the DOGE-led cuts a “growing” risk to the American economy and markets, Derek Saul reports. But they’re also worrying the very people carrying them out. Twenty-one staffers resigned from DOGE on Tuesday, saying they wouldn’t use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services,” according to the AP. And despite all these cuts, the Trump Administration has continued to rehire federal staff in “critical” positions shortly after removing them from those same positions. This week, workers at the FDA were asked to come back after trade groups pushed back against cuts. Folks at the National Park Services and those working with bird flu at the Department of Agriculture were also reinstated.

Mountain View By Byron Tau, Associated PressBrian Slodysko, Associated Press, WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” WATCH: Why a former IRS commissioner says Musk’s mass layoffs are a ‘huge mistake’ The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. READ MORE: Nearly 40 percent of contracts canceled by Musk’s DOGE are expected to produce no savings According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. AP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston. Tech billionaire and advisor to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk said that he “Will check with the President” on a $5,000 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dividend for every American taxpayer.

Maria Varela’s jaw dropped when she saw the social media post: “We will be tabling on campus asking fellow students to report their criminal classmates to ICE for deportation.” (Update: The death toll has reached 12 from the weekend flooding.) Eastern Kentucky is reeling again from flood waters with at least eight people dead after a weekend of heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, according to Gov. Andy Beshear. Two family members of the metro Atlanta person diagnosed with measles last month have also contracted the disease, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported Friday. Measles is a highly infectious, potentially deadly disease that is especially dangerous for children under 5 years old.

Brian Slodysko, Associated Press Brian Slodysko, Associated Press Byron Tau, Associated Press Byron Tau, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” WATCH: Why a former IRS commissioner says Musk’s mass layoffs are a ‘huge mistake’ The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. READ MORE: Nearly 40 percent of contracts canceled by Musk’s DOGE are expected to produce no savings According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.

All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Title: Study: Hollywood’s Male Role Models Are Failing Young Men. Where Does That Go in the Trump Era?

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A 2024 report finds young males (13-30) crave vulnerable male characters. But experts wonder if a cultural shift could lead Hollywood in another direction Late last year, entertainment industry tracker NRG (National Research Group) released a study concluding that 43% of young men aged 13-30 don’t know what it means to be a man in today’s society. “Like Ken in the ‘Barbie’ movie, men are struggling to figure out their own place,” the study says, referring to the hit movie’s multicultural troupe of “just Kens” who are baffled by the increasing power of women. The report also suggests Hollywood may be remiss in not filling the void. “A sizable number (47%) of those surveyed are looking to fictional characters, public figures, and celebrities for masculine role models over real people in their lives — signaling how important it is that Hollywood and celebrities present a multi-faceted view of what it means to be a man,” the authors state.
