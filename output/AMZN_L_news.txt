Spoilers for “Lucky Day.” When the writers for this season of Doctor Who were announced, one name in the roster put me instantly on edge. Pete McTighe may have a distinguished filmography but, in this house, he’s known as the person who wrote “Kerblam.” That’s the Chibnall-era episode summed up as “Space Amazon is great and the people protesting poor working conditions and mass-layoffs are the real villains.” Imagine then, my delighted surprise when “Lucky Day” doesn’t just get its politics right, but it does so with molotov cocktails in hand. It’s 2007 and the Doctor and Belinda land in London as the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day. The Doctor, Vindicator in hand, gets another set of coordinates before realizing a small boy, Conrad Clack, saw the TARDIS land. He hands Conrad a 50 pence piece and tells him it’s his “lucky day,” before the boy sprints back to his mother. But she’s not interested in his story about a magical blue box, striking the boy and saying she’s had enough of his lies. Conrad next encounters the TARDIS 17 years later when he spots it parked down a dark alley. There's a nearby door with a broken lock and he ventures inside to a closed down department store, where he’s stalked by an unseen monster. After a few seconds, the monster brushes past Conrad, leaving green slime on his neck — which is how it marks its prey. When the creature, the Shreek, emerges into the open ready to strike, it’s zapped away by the Doctor and Ruby. From the shadows, Conrad watches the Doctor hand Ruby a vial of antidote as she, too, was marked as prey. He stalks them back to the TARDIS and overhears their conversation — half an hour prior, she was hanging out with the Beatles, putting this just after “The Devil’s Chord.” He snaps a picture of Ruby and puts it online, asking the internet if anyone has seen this woman. He tracks down Ruby at some point after she stops traveling in the TARDIS, and invites her onto his podcast. Conrad tries to flirt with his guest, and a quick montage shows them date and start to get serious about each other. He even confesses he was present during that first encounter with the Shreek, and Ruby hands him a vial of antidote. She says the Shreek, which had tagged him with green slime, was preparing to return to this dimension to hunt him again. But UNIT — the Doctor’s military allies here on Earth — captured it (off-screen). The pair go to a countryside village where Conrad introduces her to his friends in a quiet pub. But, as night draws in, the lights begin to flicker, and the blink-and-you-miss-it blurs of scary monsters appear outside. One of Conrad’s friends, Sparky, goes missing, and Ruby calls UNIT who leap into action despite no signs of a Shreek incursion. Conrad confesses to Ruby he didn’t take the antidote, wanting to prove to her he was as brave as the Doctor to win her heart. When UNIT arrives, soldiers face off with a pair of Shreek monsters until they reveal they’re just Conrad’s stooges in rubber suits. Conrad isn’t an innocent caught up in a crisis he can’t comprehend, he’s a conspiracy theorist streamer claiming UNIT is a sham organization. He’s the type to engineer stunts and deceptively edit the resulting footage to smear his targets. I won’t name the real world figures Conrad is inspired by as we’d get angry emails from their lawyers, but I’m sure you can work out who they are. Conrad’s encounter with UNIT was livestreamed, and there’s another montage of people talking to their generic social media followers decrying the organization. He’s arrested, but quickly released, and given a welcome press tour by the British media, including a favorable BBC News report and a joke on the UK version of The Masked Singer. Conrad even gets consoled during an interview on The One Show — a prime time talk / magazine show — by its real presenter Alex Jones (not that one). UNIT’s overseers in the UK government and Geneva buckle to public pressure to put UNIT under close scrutiny. As its head, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart says, imagine the fate of the world if any dictator got their hands on UNIT’s arsenal of captured alien technology. Someone senior at UNIT demands the caged (and real) Shreek captured off-screen be removed from London and brought up to the helipad ready for transit. Meanwhile, Conrad has a man on the inside, who has been radicalized into believing his own employers are a sham, who helps him break into UNIT HQ. Kate refuses to lock the building down, insisting that it’s time the issue was solved once and for all. Conrad, with a stolen UNIT rifle in hand, tries to bait Kate into attacking her on camera with some vicious slander about her father, the legendary Brigadier. Kate is happy the Doctor isn’t here, since he won’t stop her from doing what the audience has been demanding she do for the last few minutes. She opens the cage holding the Shreek and lets it go for Conrad. Like all two-bit bullies, Conrad crumbles in the face of real danger and starts begging for mercy but Kate refuses. Sadly, Shirley hands Ruby a taser, which she uses to knock out the Shreek before it can bite Conrad’s head off. Now that his life has been saved, Conrad goes back to playing up for the livestream, boasting that UNIT’s “special effects” have gotten better. At which point the Shreek wakes up and bites his arm off. There’s a sharp cut, and next we see Conrad waking up in a prison cell with a contraption around his arm, presumably keeping it joined to his elbow. Suddenly, he hears the TARDIS noise and is brought aboard for the Doctor to tell him that he’s a bitter, sad person who will die in prison. But Conrad is unrepentant and says he “rejects” the Doctor’s “reality.” After he’s returned to the cell, he’s visited by Mrs. Flood, who confirms what he saw was real, and that she’s letting him free as it’s his “lucky day.” It does appear as if I owe Pete McTighe a fulsome apology and must assume he isn’t at fault for all of the reactionary politics of “Kerblam.” “Lucky Day” is both a worthy sequel to “73 Yards” and a sign that, if Doctor Who is just weeks from an enforced hiatus, then it’s going out swinging. It’s got a lot of targets, including the BBC’s habitual reputation-laundering of unsavory characters. The notion of who is in “the wrong” is made explicitly clear here, too, and Conrad occupies the same political (and narrative) circles as Roger ap Gwillam (Albion TV gets a reference). Like a lot of this year’s run, the episode feels like an overstuffed script which was then cut down to fit a specific runtime. But the structural work underpinning things feel more solid here, so while a lot of the connective tissue is absent, it’s not to the detriment of the story. Kate’s decision to unleash the Shreek may have been well-telegraphed but it’s better than the solution appearing out of nowhere because there’s five minutes left to run. There’s an element of the show playing to its strengths, and the genre savviness of its audience here as well. If you know the beats of a girl-meets-boy romance movie, then you’ll spot this is a cracked-ish mirror version of that. And we don’t need much evidence of Conrad’s villainy — calling the Doctor, UNIT and Kate a bunch of frauds to make money from his online audience — since we know they are our heroes. Plus, anyone who slanders Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, after all, deserves to get what’s coming to them. “Lucky Day” is smart about how it introduces us to Conrad, too, giving us obvious red flags from the get-go. Adult Conrad has no reservations about taking a picture of a stranger and sharing it online for the internet to identify on his behalf. There’s a hint of judgment in how he asks about her relationship to and with the Doctor, mirroring the way Alan Budd flirted with Belinda in “The Robot Revolution.” In fact, it’s an interesting counterpoint to that episode, since we get enough time with Conrad early on to learn to at least be wary of him, rather than it being a fairly unsupported third-act twist. If there’s one downside, it’s that the episode leans on the trope that survivors of abuse perpetuate that cycle of abuse. Conrad gets hit in the head by his mother and while it’s hard to assume a pattern of behavior from one scene, it didn’t seem like it was the first time. Much as we saw in “Lux,” there are limits to the storytelling possibilities inherent in a series about an immortal science clown traveling anywhere in time and space in a blue box. This episode is also focused on Ruby’s post-TARDIS life, which has left her in a vulnerable position. As she admits at the end of the episode, her time with the Doctor was spent in a constant state of panic and peril. She’s tired, she’s alone and the first man she tried to form a relationship with turned out to be using her. That’s bound to leave a scar, but the after effects of a trip in the TARDIS is rarely discussed in the context of the series itself. The majority of the classic series' companions lacked detailed interior lives, while modern day ones often move on to other “exciting” things rather than back to a normal life. It does appear as if the structure of the series isn’t just Russell T. Davies relying on a familiar rhythm but something more deliberate. “Lucky Day” is the fourth in a row that shares themes and elements with the same numbered episode in last year’s lineup. It’ll be interesting to see how much of next week’s “The Story and the Engine,” and the following week’s “The Interstellar Song Contest” shares with their counterparts from the first series. It’s plausible that the time fracture that was featured in “The Robot Revolution” has, somehow, knocked the series off its previously-planned course. That either within the show’s fiction or in its metafiction, we’re explicitly seeing parallel versions of those previous episodes. If you recall from that episode, too, the Doctor says he was told to meet Belinda by an unknown person. What if he was chasing down Conrad’s lead, and if so, would that be enough to create a paradox (even if the TARDIS can avoid such obstacles)? Then there’s the fact Conrad says he explicitly rejects the Doctor’s “reality,” which feels like a telling way of wording things. Especially as this season’s two-part finale is titled “Wish World” and “The Reality War,” although that title is hardly a massive clue. After all, last season’s finale was “Empire of Death,” as opposed to “The one in which it turns out Stuekh has been clinging to the TARDIS roof for God knows however long.” I’m not sure I want to read too much into Mrs. Flood releasing Conrad since that, like last week, could simply be a topper to the story. It may be that she’s simply letting him out to wreak more havoc and undermine UNIT and the Doctor’s goals rather than anything specific. Not to mention that if Mrs. Flood is a dimension-surfing entity hell-bent on destroying the Doctor, she’s hardly going to have much use for a schmucky YouTuber. This week, the BBC announced that “The Reality War” would not be getting its customary early in the day stream online. Instead, it’ll hit the iPlayer and Disney+ at the same time as the UK broadcast, and both episodes are being lined up for a small cinema release. That’s reserved for big event episodes, and it adds more weight to the rumor Gatwa has already left the show. Not to mention he’s starring in the play Born With Teeth from August 13 through November 11 — which would prevent him from shooting a season for 2026. Outside the mystery box elements of the show, this season feels as if it’s having a meta conversation with itself. “Lucky Day,” for instance, takes a similar premise as “Love and Monsters,” a Doctor-lite episode focusing on one of the so-called ordinary people who are peripherally involved in the Doctor’s adventures. Conrad is initially presented as one of the lost souls who are drawn to the Doctor — you could almost describe them as fans — but who don’t shine brightly enough to get the Time Lord’s special attention. Oh, and I can’t think of any reason beyond silly fan service that Conrad’s streaming outfit is called “Think Tank” beyond a deep cut nod to 1974’s “Robot.” After all, there’s almost nothing in common between the two entities and their goals are ostensibly in conflict.

Title: Amazon-backed creator startup Spotter lays off staffers. Read the memo from its CEO.

Spotter, a startup that works with some of YouTube's biggest stars, laid off staff this week, the company confirmed to Business Insider. BI was unable to determine the exact number of employees affected, but the layoffs impacted teams across the company. "As the macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, we've made the difficult but strategic decision to implement organizational changes, including a reduction in the size of our team," a spokesperson for Spotter told BI. The spokesperson said the cuts will help "accelerate our path to profitability by the end of this year." Spotter is a major player in the creator space. Last year, it attracted funding from Amazon as part of a larger deal to work with Spotter's creator partners. The company's talent pool includes MrBeast, Dude Perfect, and Ryan Trahan. Spotter, which was founded in 2019 and is also backed by SoftBank, built a business buying the rights to license creator content. In March, the company said it had paid out over $950 million to creators. That month, Spotter hosted a splashy pitch event in New York for creators and advertisers. The company said this week's layoffs did not impact Spotter's advertising sales team. The cuts mark Spotter's second round of layoffs in the last six months. The company laid off employees in November, a spokesperson previously told The Information. Spotter is not the only creator content licensing startup to cull staff in the past year. Jellysmack, a competitor that shares Softbank as an investor, made cuts in October amid a restructuring. Some startups focused on creator services have failed to meet growth expectations, industry investors previously told BI. Spotter also offers AI-powered products to help creators come up with video ideas, titles, and thumbnails. It runs an advertising business connecting brands with creators as well. Read the email Spotter's CEO Aaron DeBevoise sent to employees this week announcing the job cuts: Team, Today, we've made the difficult decision to part ways with some of our teammates. I understand today is challenging - particularly for those impacted. These changes were thoroughly considered, particularly given recent economic uncertainty and volatility, which have further impacted investors' demand for efficiency and profitability. Despite our success in Q1, it has become clear that in light of the economic environment, we must make targeted changes to accelerate our path to profitability and control our own destiny. To our impacted teammates: We are so thankful for your contributions which have been critical to advancing our mission to help Creators win. We have already sent calendar invites to all impacted employees for conversations today where you will learn about next steps. We are committed to supporting these team members as they transition to their next opportunities. Thank you. Aaron Jump to

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Raise The Price Of Everything
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2025/05/02/what-to-buy-before-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T18:52:52Z
Full Content:
Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resouces. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” They will now. In the past, orders coming from China (which has been levied with a formidable 145% tariff rate) were exempt from tariff fees if the total value of the order was under $800 USD. This was because of a rule known as the “de minimis exemption," the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition literally meaning “lacking significance or importance; so minor as to merit disregard.” That exemption is no more. As of May 2nd, 2025, even these smaller orders will be assessed with fees that more than double the cost paid at the time of import, and those costs will generally be passed on to consumers within the United States. According to an official White House press release: “On average, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.” It remains to be seen how much profit, if any, the new fees will actually bring to American coffers, as it often costs more for CBP to process smaller orders than the revenues raised cover. And according to PBS, orders will likely take longer to get to your door. According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Amazon warned Thursday that “tariffs and trade policies” may complicate its future, while Apple said it expects a nearly $1 billion hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, becoming the latest companies to report losses or cut financial forecasts as many cite market uncertainty aggravated by Trump’s tariffs. Tim Cook warned it will be "very difficult" to predict beyond June "because I'm not sure what will ... More happen with tariffs." May 1Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company expects Trump’s tariffs will cause a $900 million hit to the company’s bottom line during its second quarter, saying it will be “very difficult” to predict beyond June “because I’m not sure what will happen with tariffs,” as Apple’s sales in China dropped below projections. May 1Amazon said in its first quarter earnings report Thursday that its future results are “inherently unpredictable” because of factors including “changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions” and “tariff and trade policies,” the latter of which was a not a reason included in its last quarter report. May 1General Motors, which earlier said it would reassess its financial guidance for 2025 to include the “potential impact of tariffs,” lowered its forecast for earnings to between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion, as CEO Mary Barra said the company was adjusting to “the new trade policy environment.” May 1McDonald’s reported a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales through its first quarter in 2025, the largest decrease since an 8.7% dip in 2020, as the fast food giant said consumers were “grappling with uncertainty.” April 30Stellantis suspended its full-year financial guidance for the 2025 fiscal year because of “tariff-related uncertainties,” and noted the company was “highly engaged with policymakers” about tariffs and has “[taken] action to reduce impacts.” April 30Mercedes pulled its full-year outlook for the 2025 fiscal year because the “volatility with regard to tariff policies” had become “too high to reliably assess” the automaker’s business development for the remainder of the year, adding estimates could not be made “with the necessary level of certainty.” April 29UPS pulled its full-year guidance after previously forecasting revenue of $89 billion for 2025, citing the “current macro-economic uncertainty” as the shipping giant also announced it would lay off 20,000 workers by the end of the year. April 29Kraft Heinz CEO Abrams-Rivera said the company had lowered its full-year outlook as the “operating environment remains volatile,” and they would monitor the “potential impacts from macro-economic pressures such as tariffs and inflation.” April 29JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty announced the company had pulled its full-year outlook for 2025 because of “macroeconomic uncertainty,” while JetBlue president Marty St. George said the airline expected “softened demand” to continue. April 29Snap declined to issue guidance for its second quarter, as the company behind Snapchat said “uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead” could impact advertising demand. April 29Volvo warned 2025 would be a “challenging and transition year” as a result of “macroeconomic, geopolitical and market developments,” including the effects of tariffs on profits, while pulling its guidance for the year and 2026. April 24PepsiCo lowered its earnings forecast for 2025 as the company expects “more volatility and uncertainty,” CEO Ramon Laguarta said, as PepsiCo said it faces higher supply chain costs because of tariffs, “elevated macroeconomic volatility and a subdued consumer backdrop.” April 24Procter & Gamble, the owner of Tide and Charmin, among others, lowered its sales growth projections for the year despite previously expecting growth up to 4% in 2025, while CEO Jon Moeller warned of a “challenging and volatile consumer and geopolitical environment.” April 24American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told investors the airline was “taking a very cautious, even a negative approach to growth” after pulling its full-year guidance, while CFO Devon May said economic uncertainty worsened by Trump’s tariffs brought “significant weakness in our main cabin demand.” April 24Skechers pulled its full-year outlook while citing “macroeconmic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies,” as CFO John Vandemore likened the economic environment to the pandemic. April 23Thermo Fisher Scientific withdrew its full-year profit forecast while the medical equipment maker expects to take a $400 million hit in sales to China, as Trump’s tariffs would likely raise the cost of parts the company sources in China. April 23Chipotle, which reported same-store sales well below analyst expectations, according to FactSet, lowered its full-year same-store sales growth for the year because the company expects customers to spend less as concerns about the economy became “overwhelming,” CEO Scott Boatwright told investors. April 23Alaska Airlines pulled its full-year 2025 guidance because of “recent economic uncertainty and volatility.” April 23Southwest Airlines, while maintaining some of its projections for its second quarter, withdrew guidance for 2025 in its first-quarter report while citing “macroeconomic uncertainty” that makes it “difficult to forecast given recent and short-lived booking trends.” April 15United Airlines held its full-year forecast, though the company also issued a second guidance featuring far lower earnings in 2025 because United believes the economy is “impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.” April 11Logitech withdrew its outlook for its 2026 fiscal year because of the “continuing uncertainty surrounding the tariff environment.” April 9Walmart announced it would pull forecasts for operating income in its upcoming first-quarter report on May 15, as the “range of outcomes” grew as Trump’s tariffs were implemented in trade. April 9Delta, after previously cutting first-quarter earnings projections by 40 to 50 cents a share, pulled its full-year guidance “given the broad macro uncertainty,” as it was “premature to project the full year,” the airline and CEO Ed Bastian said.

Several companies have announced layoffs while citing the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Mack Trucks and Volvo Group told Forbes earlier this month that a combined 800 employees were laid off at facilities on the East Coast, with both automakers citing “market uncertainty,” the likelihood of “possible regulatory changes” and the “impact of tariffs.” Stellantis and Estée Lauder also announced layoffs. Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on April 15 that about 100,000 manufacturing jobs would be created because of Trump’s tariffs, though they would also likely remove up to 500,000 jobs across all industries. Trump levied tariffs across U.S. trade partners during his so-called “Liberation Day” earlier this month. A 90-day pause on the tariffs was announced on April 9, though a baseline 10% would remain, except for China, whose imports face 145% tariffs. The White House said Tuesday that Trump would also offer a reprieve to automakers by exempting them from paying additional tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum. Some industry leaders have said Trump’s tariffs would raise consumer prices and create market volatility, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, who warned Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts would “blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration is trying to “rebalance global trade” as the U.S. carries out tariff negotiations. Vance suggested the U.S. “want[s] to partner with people and countries” to create “a system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair.” Tariff Layoff Tracker: Mack Truck, Volvo Cut Hundreds Of Jobs As Trump’s Levies Pose ‘Market Uncertainty’ (Forbes) Trump Offers Automakers Tariff Reprieve—Latest Big Tariff Flip-Flop Since ‘Liberation Day’ (Forbes) Correction (5/1): This story has been updated to reflect that McDonald's reported a decline in sales.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. This year has seen the most layoffs since 2020, due in large part to DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts. U.S. employers slashed 105,441 positions in April, which is less than March, but still a year-over-year increase of more than 60%, per a new report from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The government has had the most layoffs of any sector in 2025, though mostly in February and March, and 48% of all job cuts have been either directly or indirectly related to DOGE’s actions. DOGE’s work has supposedly saved taxpayers an estimated $160 billion, according to its website, though it’s a far cry from Elon Musk’s original goal of $2 trillion. Amazon topped estimates for its financial results in the first three months of 2025, but issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, citing “tariff and trade policy” among the complicating factors. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the biggest exposure to China tariffs, and shares of the retail giant fell more than 4% in after-hours trading. Apple also reported an uptick in iPhone sales in its earnings Thursday, though its China sales and services fell short of expectations. The quarter also doesn’t include the volatile April that saw President Donald Trump unveil his “Liberation Day” tariffs, though the White House has since lowered tariffs on Chinese smartphone imports from 145% to 20%. Khosla Ventures is in talks to lead a $100 million funding round into buzzy drone startup Mach Industries, Forbes has learned, a deal that could value Mach as high as $400 million, one person said. An investment in Mach, founded by Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Ethan Thornton, would be the latest in a string of huge deals for Silicon Valley defense companies that are hoping to secure major Pentagon contracts. President Donald Trump, accompanied by U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, takes a question ... More from a reporter. Hours after reports circulated that national security advisor Mike Waltz would depart his role, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Waltz for United Nations ambassador and have Secretary of State Marco Rubio serve as interim national security advisor. Some lawmakers had previously called on Waltz to resign after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said Waltz added him to a Signal group chat where Waltz and other Trump officials discussed upcoming strikes on Yemen. Trump’s attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members hit a roadblock Thursday, as a federal judge issued the first permanent injunction against the administration’s use of the law. The ruling argues the administration is not using the law properly, as it can only be invoked when there is a declared war or an “invasion of predatory incursion” carried out or threatened against the U.S. by a foreign nation. It’s unclear how the government will respond, but it’s possible the case could end up before the Supreme Court. Chinese officials said Friday they are examining purported U.S. efforts to initiate trade talks, signaling a shift in tone by Beijing and prompting a rise in U.S. stock futures and European markets. A Chinese official emphasized that Beijing expects any dialogue or talks to lead to a reversal of Trump’s steep 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and if this is not done it will “further damage trust” between the two sides. In the latest sign that economic unknowns are weighing on the travel sector, Hilton, Hyatt and Wyndham cut their full-year outlooks this week, following in the wake of major airlines. Wyndham CEO Geoff Ballotti told Wall Street analysts that “consumer sentiment resulting from the macro uncertainty” was weighing on the leisure segment. Cheap goods from websites like Temu, Shein and eBay could get more expensive, as the government closes the “de minimis” trade exemption today, which allowed U.S. companies to import packages valued at $800 or less without paying duties or certain taxes. The U.S. Postal Service will reportedly choose whether to charge a 120% tariff on low-priced packages shipped from China and Hong Kong or include a flat fee of $100 per shipment. After multiple delays, travelers will finally need a REAL ID or an alternative form of identification to get through TSA checkpoints starting May 7. If you don’t have a REAL ID—typically marked by a star in the upper right corner, though every state looks different—passengers can also use roughly a dozen other forms of compliant identification, including passports and military IDs. Anyone going to see Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* can expect to watch eight—perhaps even 10—movie trailers before the feature begins. That may seem like a drag to an audience, but those are highly valuable minutes to both the movie studios and the theater chains. In an era when theatrical attendance continues to decline—the domestic box office grossed $8.7 billion last year, a dip of more than 3% from 2023, and ticket sales dropped 7%—trailers remain the top driver of awareness and decision-making for most moviegoers. According to National Research Group’s biannual survey, 36% of those between the ages of 12 and 74 say they first heard about the most recent movie they saw in theaters through a trailer, more than any other source. Because Thunderbolts* is the first anticipated blockbuster of the summer movie season—which accounts for 40% of the annual box office total in the U.S. and Canada—its preview space is one of the most important marketing opportunities for the biggest releases. With fierce competition for these theoretically finite slots, there’s another reason for the increased number of trailers—theater chains are selling preview time to the highest bidder. Hollywood’s major studios routinely strike year-long marketing agreements with the three major theater chains—AMC, Regal and Cinemark—to guarantee trailer play in front of the biggest releases. Those deals range from $2 million to $5 million each, proportionate to the size of the chain, and can include other in-theater marketing opportunities such as ads on concession stands or theater marquees. What exactly that money buys, however, is not always clear. Most moviegoers would assume the trailer system would be similar to any other advertising expenditure, but in practice studio executives say it can often feel closer to a bribe. WHY IT MATTERS “With theatrical moviegoing in decline, it’s not hard to imagine why theaters might increase their number of valuable trailer slots—or why studios might pay to fill them,” says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. “But as previews continue to expand to nearly a half-hour, one has to wonder just how much moviegoers are willing to accept.” MORE Why This Film Financing Company Is The Safest Bet In Hollywood Despite the publicity around its immigration enforcement, Trump Administration officials have provided an incomplete picture of the number of deportations since the president took office. While ICE reports deporting fewer people per day than the Biden Administration, in recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has started to release new figures that are more than double the ICE data: 660: The average number of people deported per day during Trump’s first 100 days, according to ICE, compared to a daily average of 742 under Biden last year 7,181: The number of people crossing the southern border illegally and being apprehended by Customs and Border Protection last month, compared to 137,473 under Biden in March 2024 “It’s one thing to play politics with politics—it’s another to play politics with the data,” Austin Kocher, an immigration data analyst and researcher at Syracuse University told Forbes Feedback is essential in the workplace, but sometimes the delivery can feel like a personal attack rather than constructive criticism. It’s important not to let such critiques define you, and don’t attach your self-worth to who you are at work. The next time you get unhelpful feedback, reflect on the boundaries you can set with that person so it doesn’t happen again.

Title: Spotify was great at helping you discover new music. Then the staff cuts began.

Spotify cut costs to turn a profit. Now subscribers are being flooded with music they hate. The music app I've been using for the last 14 years recently decided that I'm obsessed with rainstorms. When I last listened to my Spotify Release Radar playlist — which for years reliably curated a decent selection of newly released music informed by my favorite artists — the lineup quickly took a turn for the worse. After new songs by familiar indie pop names like Japanese Breakfast and The Marias, there was a five-minute recording of rain falling followed by a short, ambient instrumental by a little-known alternative rock artist. Then, for its remaining 25 tracks, my playlist delivered a succession of rainstorms, nature sounds, and brown-noise frequencies — not exactly the stuff of a killer music festival lineup. When Spotify launched Release Radar in 2016, it promised "a weekly selection of the newest releases that matter the most to you." Not only was the feature designed to delight music fans upon first listen, but it would get better over time, the company promised. So why, nearly a decade later, was my latest Release Radar delivering 85% noise? Sure, my girlfriend and I had recently started listening to "sleep sounds" — things like ocean waves and the hum of an airplane's engine — at night, but that didn't fully explain the issue. The algorithm hadn't made such a crucial curation error before. I'm hardly the first Spotify subscriber to notice that the gears of its music recommendation engine have gotten rusty. Over the past year, fans have taken to Reddit, LinkedIn, and other platforms to complain that curated, for you playlists like Release Radar, Discover Weekly, and Daily Mix have gone downhill, resulting in what many describe as an "echo chamber" that feels more repetitive or off the mark than it once did. Random tracks from white-noise playlists or kids' music albums are popping up where they don't belong, ruining the listening experience. Molly Holder, Spotify's senior director of product for personalization, disagreed that the quality of these curated playlists has declined. "People are discovering more new music and spending more time doing so," she said in a statement, adding that the company listens to user feedback, continues to enhance personal recommendations, and that listener engagement metrics are up. But after talking with former Spotify employees, it seems likely that a combination of layoffs and shifting business priorities has hollowed out the platform's music discovery product. Essentially, in a quest for profitability, Spotify broke its algorithm. One of the features that set Spotify apart from its intensifying competition over the years was the platform's man-meets-machine approach to music curation, especially its personalized, algorithmically curated playlists. Discover Weekly promised to introduce listeners to new music that they might like, Daily Mix turned their tastes into themed playlists, and Release Radar highlighted freshly released tracks. For years, these features seemed to elicit near-universal praise online and gave Spotify a competitive advantage just in time to fend off competition from giants like Apple and Amazon. The music discovery features are likely one reason it's been able to lead the global music subscription market. A recent EMARKETER report found that Americans spend over nine times as much time on Spotify as the next closest competitor. Lately, though, those same features have inspired frustration. For many, Discover Weekly has gotten worse at delivering songs that align with their musical tastes, sometimes including songs they've already listened to on Spotify. Other users report that Release Radar misses new releases from artists they like or mistakenly includes tracks that came out weeks earlier. Release Radar has also started including less relevant music from what one Reddit user described as "random artists with under 50k listens" that seemed to come out of nowhere, while others bemoan the inclusion of what sounds like "AI garbage." The most audible groan of disapproval came with the arrival of Spotify Wrapped last year. While the personalized year-end recap playlist had historically sparked a tsunami of positive online buzz each year, the 2024 edition prompted a far more mixed reaction. Listeners said it lacked personality and interesting insights into their music habits. Jeffrey Smith, a self-described "Spotify diehard" who leads marketing for the online music marketplace Discogs, has become so frustrated by the platform's declining music discovery feature that he's considering switching to Apple Music. "Over the last couple of years, Spotify has met my needs less and less," Smith said. "It's not really reflective of my listening behavior as much as it is reflective of what they want me to listen to. It's just a listening machine at this point, not a music platform." Smith's affinity for Spotify started fading when he noticed one song — "Back on 74" by Jungle — kept popping up on his personalized Spotify playlists. While it's possible that he had checked the song out at some point, it wasn't something he enjoyed or actively listened to. Still, the song made its way from one personalized music recommendation feature to another and even started inspiring Spotify's algorithms to play similar songs. "It just continued until I finally said, 'I can't take it,'" Smith said. As a music obsessive working at a major marketplace for vinyl records, Smith has no shortage of sources of quality music recommendations. But the days of Spotify augmenting his organic music discovery appear to be over. If he keeps his Spotify subscription at all, he says it will be for the podcasts and audiobooks the company has added to its premium tier. I've found myself in a similar conundrum. After largely dismissing the 2015 launch of Apple Music as a then-satisfied Spotify subscriber, I recently decided to give Apple's music service another try. Since its debut, Apple Music has prioritized human editors over algorithms for music curation. Where it does use data-driven personalization, the results are pretty solid, and crucially, free of rainstorms. While Spotify's new audiobook library makes it tempting to stay, its playlists no longer feel like the best in the business. Once my free trial of Apple Music is over, I'm planning to make the switch. Music subscription services like Spotify spend an extraordinary amount of money — last year, the company said it spent $10 billion — to license their massive music catalogs from record labels, publishers, and other rightsholders. These high costs make it more challenging to turn an enduring profit, something Spotify only managed to do for the first time in 2024. From Wall Street's perspective, Spotify is killing it as year-over-year metrics like subscribers and revenue continue to grow. But in the quest to please investors, some ex-Spotify employees think it has abandoned too much of the human element that makes music and the culture around it so special. Doug Ford was a Spotify executive who oversaw editorial playlist curation from 2013 to 2018. He arrived via Spotify's acquisition of Tunigo, a Swedish company that specialized in expert-curated music playlists based on different genres and moods. The next year, Spotify acquired Echo Nest, a music data startup founded by MIT grads that used a mix of machine learning and data filtering to build Pandora-style music recommendation algorithms. Both teams built out Spotify's man-meets-machine music discovery system, which helped the company successfully weather new competition from tech giants like Apple and Amazon as it started to explore the possibility of going public. "That was a really beautiful moment in Spotify's history," Ford said. "That mix of the intentional algorithmic and human curation to make a really deep product was great." The results spoke for themselves. Spotify said the 2015 launch of Discover Weekly yielded 1.7 billion streams in its first five months and generated a weekly wave of social media buzz when listeners' Discover Weekly playlists were refreshed. "Our goal with Discover Weekly was to make something that felt like a friend or someone who knew you well was making you a mixtape," Spotify's product lead at the time, Matt Ogle, told me in an interview. To accomplish that feeling, the algorithm drew heavily from how real flesh-and-blood music enthusiasts were curating playlists on the platform. "That's why that thing was so good," Ford said. "It was taking all the inputs equally and letting things happen normally with the audience. Now it feels a little bit different." Ford said things started changing in the lead-up to Spotify's 2018 initial public offering and the ensuing pressure to prove to investors that profitability was possible in the notoriously tight-margined music streaming business. "The culture changed because it had to become a business," Ford said. "You need to be a successful business in order to offer this utility to people. But they've discarded some of the human aspects of it, for sure." One way the company shifted was by finding cheaper content to use. As the journalist Liz Pelly outlines in her book "Mood Machine," Spotify's pre-IPO years saw an increasing reliance on what is known internally as "perfect fit content," a euphemism for cheaper-to-license audio and mood-specific stock music that is optimized for longer listening sessions. As more listeners turned to streaming services like Spotify for "chill vibes" playlists and background music for studying, the company realized it could save money on royalty costs by populating those playlists with the cheap stuff. That would certainly explain the astonishing number of rainstorm audio tracks being released in a given week. Ford watched with dismay as the platform became flooded with generic mood music. Around the same time, he said, respected colleagues started leaving the company. After what he describes as "a particularly bad stretch" of feeling frustrated by what he saw as a dramatic culture shift, Ford accepted an offer from YouTube to lead content for its music subscription service in 2018. In the years since, Spotify's music programming strategy has only skewed more heavily toward automation. Pelly writes that by late 2023, the number of Spotify employees working on editorial music curation (about 200 people globally) was less than one-third the size of the team focused on algorithmic curation and personalization, according to an internal org chart. Notably, that head count was before Spotify laid off 17% of its total workforce in December 2023, a drastic cost-cutting measure that CEO Daniel Ek later admitted "did disrupt our day-to-day operations more than we anticipated." Holder said that there are now over 130 employees working on editorial music curation. One of the more palpable victims of Spotify's 2023 cuts was Glenn McDonald, the company's data alchemist (his real job title), who came from the original Echo Nest team and designed and built much of the original data infrastructure and algorithms powering Spotify's music recommendation engine. He designed the system that identifies a song's genre, which was crucial to effectively sort and recommend music and understand listeners' tastes. "The genre system was human-guided," McDonald said. "After they laid me off, they replaced it with a system that is not human-guided. It's just machine learning. It looks at patterns of words in the titles and descriptions of playlists. That's objectively worse." McDonald said the ripple effects of this change could be felt across Spotify's listening experience. Music was often misclassified, like when Swedish folk-metal bands were suddenly lumped in with all other folk artists. He said it took Spotify engineers a year to fully deactivate and replace the genre system he built, according to data output from the company's public API. One of the many data-filtering tools he built during his tenure at the company was a set of filters designed to fine-tune the music recommendations presented by Discover Weekly and Release Radar — and crucially, prevent things like nature sounds and ambient noise frequencies from showing up where they don't belong. "They would have been flagged as anomalies on those dashboards, and I would have followed up with the teams in charge of those recommendations," McDonald explained. "Without those dashboards, probably nobody is even watching for these issues." Holder said that Spotify's approach to classifying genres and subgenres has "evolved" from the legacy system built by McDonald and other Echo Nest engineers, but declined to get into technical specifics of how it works now or what advantages the new system introduces. "We're always laser-focused on continually enhancing personalized recommendations," she said. Recent updates include improvements to genre accuracy and Discover Weekly recommendations, she added. Ford said the changes at Spotify are part of a broader industry shift away from costlier human curation. "There's been a tradeoff in favor of high metrics, long listening sessions, and music that's just 'good enough,'" he said. "It's happening everywhere." The result is what Ford calls a "rampant wave of algorithmic fatigue" among listeners, who are clamoring for more meaningful cultural experiences as online platforms become increasingly hyper-automated. While the occasional bug and ongoing iteration are to be expected in any product, some longtime subscribers find it odd that Spotify would need to fix or enhance features that worked so well in the first place. My Release Radar delivering mostly white noise and rainstorms, for instance, feels like a fundamental failure of what that feature used to do so well. Over the course of reporting and writing this story over the last few weeks, I've checked back with my Release Radar. Each week, it has a few new songs, but it's still mostly rainstorms.

Here, Reuters intentionally misleads the public into believing that President Trump’s policies are leading to 20,000 layoffs at UPS: April 29 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service said on Tuesday it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as part of a planned reduction in deliveries for Amazon.com, and amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs that are roiling global trade. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The layoffs are occurring because UPS and Amazon are greatly reducing shipping volume (50%) from Amazon: A UPS (UPS.N), opens new tab spokesperson said the layoffs are due to shedding 50% of shipping volume from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, its largest customer, as well as ongoing cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring. My guess is that UPS was losing its shorts on this deal, and cuts have been in the works for a long time. The media and other Democrats are also blaming Trump’s tariff policies for causing a negative print on GDP but, of course, they aren’t telling the public the details of what caused the decline. The trade deficit has been deteriorating for decades, and in the first quarter the deficit hit a record high that shaved a “whopping” 4.8% off growth. The media and other Democrats oppose all of Trump’s efforts to correct this long-term disaster. For four years, the Biden administration spent and printed massive amounts of money jacking up federal spending. This spending and borrowing masked a deteriorating private sector. In the first quarter, federal spending went down 5.1%, which reduced GDP growth by .3%. So, without those two components GDP would have been exceptionally strong at over 5%. The media can’t allow the public to see the truth. As Trump has announced trillions in private investments, the media and other Democrats are repeating the talking points (lies) that companies and countries are scared to invest in America because of Trump’s policies. But here is what investments actually did in the first quarter according to Google AI: investments soared (but the public can’t be allowed to see the truth). In the first quarter of 2025, business investment increased by 21.9% compared to the previous quarter. This increase followed a 5.6% decline in the fourth quarter. Nonresidential investment was up 9.8% in the quarter, with a 22.5% increase in equipment spending. Before and after the election, the media told the public that inflation would soar because of tariffs, and most Americans believe it. But commodity prices are falling, in many cases rapidly: World Bank sees commodity prices falling to pre-COVID level World Bank: Commodity prices to fall 12% in 2025, 5% in 2026 Falling commodity prices could moderate inflation risks from rising trade barriers-World Bank World Bank report forecasts Brent crude at $64/barrel in 2025 vs $81 in 2024 Crude oil, for example, is down over 25% since January, and crude oil and energy prices essentially affect everything. So, what happened the last time commodity prices were this low? Trump was president Inflation was lower than 2% Real wages were rising rapidly for all races, especially for those at the bottom. And the media and other Democrats were opposing Trump’s policies at every turn and continually trying to impeach him. In other words, they haven’t changed. Results don’t matter. When is Jerome Powell going to pay attention to facts that commodity prices are actively falling, instead of predictions? Powell seems to have been unable to analyze the causes of the higher inflation that marked the Biden years, but somehow has an ability to recognize what substantially lower energy and other prices do to inflation. Two-year, five-year, and ten-year bond rates are all substantially lower than what the Federal Reserve is paying banks for one-day rates. They are losing billions because of this ridiculous policy that appears meant to hurt Trump. It certainly would make buying a house more unaffordable if they sensibly reduced rates. A favorite word of the media and other Democrats these last few months has been “chaos” — but they didn’t use the term during four years of unprecedented chaos under Biden-Harris. They told Americans Biden had returned America to normalcy. Here are some examples of what chaos looks like: An open border which floods cities and states with millions of unvetted people including terrorists and gang members. Cartels getting rich off of trafficking millions of people, especially children for sex. Schools and businesses being closed by things Fauci said, not science. Firing people for choosing not to take a vaccine. High inflation. Running up massive debt during a period of supposed good growth. The Afghanistan withdrawal. The reignition of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Hamstringing Israel from obliterating the terrorists of Hamas. Terrorists attacking ships in the Red Sea. Building up Iran as it seeks to build nuclear weapons and makes “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” a primary focus. Seeking to destroy energy sources. Using the Justice Department to go after parents who oppose pornography in schools, Catholics, and peaceful pro-life supporters. Having unelected bureaucrats run the government and sign documents because Biden was incompetent. Making women compete and share locker room space with men. Here is a sample of what chaos doesn’t look like: Enforcing the border and deporting illegals. Bringing investments and manufacturing back. Getting control of the bloated federal government. Getting the price of energy down. Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

The gross GST Collections for April 2025 have scaled a new high of Rs. 2.37 lakh crores, against the previous high of INR 2.10 lakh crores in April 2024. The growth in GST collections for April is expected since GST on transactions during March, which is the last month of the fiscal year, is payable in April. Due to significant number of year end transactions which take place in March, traditionally, GST collections for April are significantly higher. However, specifically for April 2025, another indicator, which led to anticipation of significantly high GST collections was the 20.2% growth in generation of e-way bills in March 2025, as per data in the monthly economic review for March 2025 released by the Department of Economic Affairs.

Regards Viral Shah, IIFL The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates steady on Thursday and sharply lowered its growth forecasts, signaling prolonged caution due to the uncertain global trade environment. With concerns over U.S. tariffs and weak exports weighing on sentiment, the BOJ suggested that conditions for future rate hikes may take time to materialize. As a result, the yen weakened to a four-week low, with the dollar climbing 1.7% to 145.45 yen, buoyed by renewed optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the U.S. and its partners. Meanwhile, in the U.S., manufacturing remained under pressure, contracting for the second consecutive month in April. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7—its lowest in five months—from 49.0 in March. Tariff-related disruptions to supply chains pushed up input costs, forcing some firms to cut jobs, even as overall layoffs announced by employers declined. On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands.

Amazon warned Thursday that “tariffs and trade policies” may complicate its future, while Apple said it expects a nearly $1 billion hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, becoming the latest companies to report losses or cut financial forecasts as many cite market uncertainty aggravated by Trump’s tariffs. Tim Cook warned it will be "very difficult" to predict beyond June "because I'm not sure what will ... More happen with tariffs." May 1Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company expects Trump’s tariffs will cause a $900 million hit to the company’s bottom line during its second quarter, saying it will be “very difficult” to predict beyond June “because I’m not sure what will happen with tariffs,” as Apple’s sales in China dropped below projections. May 1Amazon said in its first quarter earnings report Thursday that its future results are “inherently unpredictable” because of factors including “changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions” and “tariff and trade policies,” the latter of which was a not a reason included in its last quarter report. May 1General Motors, which earlier said it would reassess its financial guidance for 2025 to include the “potential impact of tariffs,” lowered its forecast for earnings to between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion, as CEO Mary Barra said the company was adjusting to “the new trade policy environment.” May 1McDonald’s reported a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales through its first quarter in 2025, the largest decrease since an 8.7% dip in 2020, as the fast food giant said consumers were “grappling with uncertainty.” April 30Stellantis suspended its full-year financial guidance for the 2025 fiscal year because of “tariff-related uncertainties,” and noted the company was “highly engaged with policymakers” about tariffs and has “[taken] action to reduce impacts.” April 30Mercedes pulled its full-year outlook for the 2025 fiscal year because the “volatility with regard to tariff policies” had become “too high to reliably assess” the automaker’s business development for the remainder of the year, adding estimates could not be made “with the necessary level of certainty.” April 29UPS pulled its full-year guidance after previously forecasting revenue of $89 billion for 2025, citing the “current macro-economic uncertainty” as the shipping giant also announced it would lay off 20,000 workers by the end of the year. April 29Kraft Heinz CEO Abrams-Rivera said the company had lowered its full-year outlook as the “operating environment remains volatile,” and they would monitor the “potential impacts from macro-economic pressures such as tariffs and inflation.” April 29JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty announced the company had pulled its full-year outlook for 2025 because of “macroeconomic uncertainty,” while JetBlue president Marty St. George said the airline expected “softened demand” to continue. April 29Snap declined to issue guidance for its second quarter, as the company behind Snapchat said “uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead” could impact advertising demand. April 29Volvo warned 2025 would be a “challenging and transition year” as a result of “macroeconomic, geopolitical and market developments,” including the effects of tariffs on profits, while pulling its guidance for the year and 2026. April 24PepsiCo lowered its earnings forecast for 2025 as the company expects “more volatility and uncertainty,” CEO Ramon Laguarta said, as PepsiCo said it faces higher supply chain costs because of tariffs, “elevated macroeconomic volatility and a subdued consumer backdrop.” April 24Procter & Gamble, the owner of Tide and Charmin, among others, lowered its sales growth projections for the year despite previously expecting growth up to 4% in 2025, while CEO Jon Moeller warned of a “challenging and volatile consumer and geopolitical environment.” April 24American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told investors the airline was “taking a very cautious, even a negative approach to growth” after pulling its full-year guidance, while CFO Devon May said economic uncertainty worsened by Trump’s tariffs brought “significant weakness in our main cabin demand.” April 24Skechers pulled its full-year outlook while citing “macroeconmic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies,” as CFO John Vandemore likened the economic environment to the pandemic. April 23Thermo Fisher Scientific withdrew its full-year profit forecast while the medical equipment maker expects to take a $400 million hit in sales to China, as Trump’s tariffs would likely raise the cost of parts the company sources in China. April 23Chipotle, which reported same-store sales well below analyst expectations, according to FactSet, lowered its full-year same-store sales growth for the year because the company expects customers to spend less as concerns about the economy became “overwhelming,” CEO Scott Boatwright told investors. April 23Alaska Airlines pulled its full-year 2025 guidance because of “recent economic uncertainty and volatility.” April 23Southwest Airlines, while maintaining some of its projections for its second quarter, withdrew guidance for 2025 in its first-quarter report while citing “macroeconomic uncertainty” that makes it “difficult to forecast given recent and short-lived booking trends.” April 15United Airlines held its full-year forecast, though the company also issued a second guidance featuring far lower earnings in 2025 because United believes the economy is “impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.” April 11Logitech withdrew its outlook for its 2026 fiscal year because of the “continuing uncertainty surrounding the tariff environment.” April 9Walmart announced it would pull forecasts for operating income in its upcoming first-quarter report on May 15, as the “range of outcomes” grew as Trump’s tariffs were implemented in trade. April 9Delta, after previously cutting first-quarter earnings projections by 40 to 50 cents a share, pulled its full-year guidance “given the broad macro uncertainty,” as it was “premature to project the full year,” the airline and CEO Ed Bastian said.

Several companies have announced layoffs while citing the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Mack Trucks and Volvo Group told Forbes earlier this month that a combined 800 employees were laid off at facilities on the East Coast, with both automakers citing “market uncertainty,” the likelihood of “possible regulatory changes” and the “impact of tariffs.” Stellantis and Estée Lauder also announced layoffs. Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on April 15 that about 100,000 manufacturing jobs would be created because of Trump’s tariffs, though they would also likely remove up to 500,000 jobs across all industries. Trump levied tariffs across U.S. trade partners during his so-called “Liberation Day” earlier this month. A 90-day pause on the tariffs was announced on April 9, though a baseline 10% would remain, except for China, whose imports face 145% tariffs. The White House said Tuesday that Trump would also offer a reprieve to automakers by exempting them from paying additional tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum. Some industry leaders have said Trump’s tariffs would raise consumer prices and create market volatility, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, who warned Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts would “blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration is trying to “rebalance global trade” as the U.S. carries out tariff negotiations. Vance suggested the U.S. “want[s] to partner with people and countries” to create “a system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair.” Tariff Layoff Tracker: Mack Truck, Volvo Cut Hundreds Of Jobs As Trump’s Levies Pose ‘Market Uncertainty’ (Forbes) Trump Offers Automakers Tariff Reprieve—Latest Big Tariff Flip-Flop Since ‘Liberation Day’ (Forbes) Correction (5/1): This story has been updated to reflect that McDonald's reported a decline in sales.

Good morning. President Donald Trump held a rally this week in Macomb County, Michigan, to mark his first 100 days in office. BI had a reporter in attendance. The key issue for rallygoers they spoke with was, surprisingly, not the economy. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, it's a crucial week for Big Tech. We're breaking down the key details from Meta's and Microsoft's earnings reports — and looking ahead to what Wall Street will be watching for when Apple and Amazon report today. Exciting news: Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Get the scoop on what's happening inside the world's most powerful tech companies — sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Despite the S&P 500's recent rally, Wall Street forecasters see more pain ahead. Tech: Meta, Microsoft, and Google are leading a performance management vibe shift. Business: Why you can expect to see more professionally produced videos on your LinkedIn feed. But first, a moment of truth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a big week for Big Tech. On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn. The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there. The Ms Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs. Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell. The As 1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months. 2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon. 3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI. 1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces. 2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday. 3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs. 1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI. 2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were "no plans" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work. 3. LinkedIn wants a bigger slice of the creator economy. The professional networking site said it's planning to launch five new shows from business-oriented creators, including podcast host Steven Bartlett and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff. Apple, Amazon, McDonald's, Reddit, and Airbnb report earnings. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: UPS 'committed to supporting' employees during upcoming layoffs, facility closures

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. - Sandy Springs-based UPS says it will support its workers through an upcoming round of layoffs this year. Earlier this week, the company announced that it plans to cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 leased and owned facilities by the end of June. What we know: The package company says the move is part of a plan to drastically reduce the amount of Amazon shipments it handles. In January, UPS announced that it had struck a deal with Amazon, its largest client, to minimize its volume by over 50% by 2026. The company is still reviewing its network and may identify more buildings to be shuttered. Specific details about which areas of business and what buildings may face the cuts were not released. What they're saying: In a statement to FOX 5, a company spokesperson said UPS was "committed to supporting our employees throughout this process." "While our building footprint is changing, our record of reliable pickup and delivery is not," the statement read. "We remain committed to providing industry-leading service to customers in more than 200 countries and territories around the world." "The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier," CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement announcing the layoffs. "The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS." By the numbers: The company employs about 490,000 workers, according to FactSet. This week, United Parcel Service Inc. also reported its first-quarter financial results. The company earned $1.19 billion, or $$1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $1.49 per share. That’s better than the $1.44 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for. Revenue totaled $21.55 billion, beating Wall Street’s estimate of $21.06 billion. UPS said that it wasn’t providing any updates to its previously announced full-year outlook, given current macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously said that it expected 2025 revenue of approximately $89 billion. The Source: Information for this story was taken from a statement by UPS and a report by the Associated Press.

Title: Teamsters President: ‘UPS Will Be in for a Hell of a Fight’ After Layoffs

By Glenn Taylor The announcement from UPS that it would lay off 20,000 employees in 2025 generated some blowback from its largest union. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents more than 300,000 workers at the parcel delivery company, suggested in the hours after the call took place that it was ready to take legal action if any layoffs violate the terms of their current five-year contract. “United Parcel Service is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement,” said Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien in a statement Tuesday afternoon. “If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won’t stand in its way. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” Two years ago, the Teamsters and UPS agreed to the contract after a contentious bargaining period that saw the 1.3-million-member union threaten to go on strike. As the bill from the contract racked up—UPS said it paid $1.4 billion more in compensation and benefits expenses in 2024 due to the deal—cuts had to be made elsewhere. The courier laid off 12,000 employees to start that year, with most of those roles coming from management, as well as some contractors. But those layoffs came along before last year’s introduction of UPS’ Network of the Future, the company’s logistics network consolidation designed to flow more volume into automated warehouses. Under the plan, UPS is closing roughly 200 facilities, namely sortation centers. The company aims to close 73 sites this year. Related Stories Topics UPS Slashes 20,000 Jobs as it Weans Off Amazon Topics Smarter, Greener, Stronger: How Tech is Driving Manufacturing Back to the US From a longer-term perspective, the automation push sows some concern into how many employees will get axed through the end of 2028, when the Network of the Future plan is expected to run its course. When news first broke out that UPS would temporarily shutter a package processing facility in Portland, Ore. on July 1 amid an automation deployment, Teamsters national vice president John Palmer admitted to The Oregonian that the union should have done a better job negotiating contracts that protect workers. “If you’re going to get displaced, based on your years of service there ought to be some sort of severance,” Palmer said. “Automation is a real thing. There’s only so much we can do to stop progress. But the other side of it is when you have a corporation like UPS that makes billions of dollars in profit every quarter.” Additionally, Palmer had suggested that the Teamsters should have sought a contract that promised longtime employees the chance to train for maintenance of automated sorting machines. The scenario in Portland is happening across dozens of facilities that are getting renovated to fully or partly incorporate automation. Reports of a possible brewing partnership with robotics startup Figure AI, in which UPS would use humanoid robots within its warehousing network, are likely to add insult to injury for the Teamsters. UPS never confirmed the partnership talks, or the use of a humanoid robot, but company brass hasn’t been shy about admitting that the automation crusade is going to end up impacting jobs. “The end result will be a much more efficient operation with less dependency on labor,” said Nando Cesarone, president U.S. at UPS, in Tuesday’s earnings call. The UPS-Teamsters deal, which lasts through July 31, 2028, is supposed to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs, with 7,500 of them being full-time gigs. The master contract has no mention of automation or robotics. UPS isn’t the only logistics player in the Teamsters’ crosshairs. O’Brien took aim at another one of his common targets, Amazon, in a post on X Tuesday following the White House’s blasting of the e-commerce giant for reportedly planning to show added tariff costs on consumer products. “News flash: Amazon has ZERO allegiance to the United States. Decades after free trade politicians sold out American workers, Amazon has built an international empire fueled by industrial slavery managed by the Chinese Communist Party,” wrote O’Brien, in a reference to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s insistence that the company “has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.” Amazon later denied that any tariff-displaying plans were in place. O’Brien’s mini-rant came a week after a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Amazon must collectively bargain with Teamsters-affiliated warehouse workers at a San Francisco distribution center. “While here in the U.S., it neglects, abuses, and disowns an American workforce to further inflate its profit margins,” O’Brien said in his post. “What Jeff Bezos and Amazon are really afraid of is sharing their wealth with the people who created it.

Editor Activism Activist Post, David Icke, Neenah Payne David Icke Banned From 26 Nations For Two More Years!Legendary British author David Icke has been trying to wake up humanity for decades. He has written over 20 books and has spoken to vast audiences in over 25 countries. Icke was invited to attend the 11/5/22 peace rally “Together for the Netherlands” as a featured speaker. However, far-left activist groups demanded that Icke be barred from entering the country. His son Gareth said the Dutch government banned Icke from the country (not just from the rally) for two years on the charge that he is a “Level 3 terrorist”. Because the Netherlands are part of The Schengen area which consists of 25 other European nations, Icke was banned for two years from 26 countries in Europe as well as other countries — including the US and Australia — that follow the guidelines of The Schengen area! Icke had planned a tour throughout much of Europe for the Spring of 2023 where he would have spoken to tens of thousands of people. Icke’s site showed in late 2024 that the ban was extended for two more years – until November 2026!Is the ban permanent? It looks like the globalists don’t want the world to hear Icke’s views. Why?David Icke banned from Europe for ANOTHER TWO YEARS because he has NOT CHANGED HIS VIEWS. Talk about fascism in our face. “The first two-year ban ends in November. I wonder if the mainstream hijack of the ‘alternative’ media might at last have something to say about this having virtually ignored the first ban.” Trailer: Persona Non Grata Persona Non Grata – David Icke’s Brand New Documentary – OFFICIAL TRAILERBanned from Europe and Australia. Demonised. Mocked. With his back straight, chin up and almost supernatural courage, DAVID ICKE has been doing in-depth research into spirituality, conspiracy theories and metaphysical sciences for more than 35 years. His work is about who we really are, what the reality is in which we live and who pulls the strings behind the scenes of the world stage. In the film PERSONA NON GRATA, filmmaker Christianne van Wijk investigates the paradox of David’s infamous image and his real message. A MUST-SEE for anyone who wants to understand what is at stake in a period when censorship is reaching Orwellian proportions. It is high time that the spiritual truth comes to the surface.Film available exclusively on Ickonic at midnight – Saturday 29th April. REGISTER YOUR E-MAIL HERE FOR UPDATES The Global Ban On One Man! David Icke & Chrissy Van Wijk Interview David Icke joins us together with filmmaker Christianne Van Wijk to talk about the new movie PERSONA NON GRATA about David’s unprecedented ban from almost all European and many other countries of the world. Great night at the Dutch premiere of Persona Non Grata – wish I had been there!More wonderful feedback from our audience tonight live in The Netherlands for the exclusive premiere of Persona Non Grata – The Demonisation of David Icke Tune in this Saturday 29th March on http://ickonic.com for the launch! In the video further below, Icke explains why the Netherlands is forcing 3,000 farmers out of business.Icke calls out former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as a puppet of Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum. Icke gave his speech on the beach. Gareth pointed out that because of the ban on his father, more people probably heard his speech below which was posted on his site than if Icke had attended the peace rally! I Icke spoke about the fight of Dutch farmers as the government tries to impose unprecedented restrictions and force them to sell their farms. This affects all of Europe and beyond because the Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. See more information. Icke spoke about Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum as an expression of the global cult taking over the world now. Icke called out Prime Minister Rutte as an asset of the World Economic Forum and told the Dutch people, “He runs your country for the agenda of Klaus Schwab who runs the World Economic Forum for the agenda of the global cult. So, Rutte is not running The Netherlands for the people of that country. He’s running it for the World Economic Forum.Klaus Schwab Resigns: April 2025World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab retires as chairman 4/21/25WEF confirms probe into founder Klaus Schwab 4/23/25WEF launches investigation into founder Klaus Schwab 4/24/25Move comes after Schwab and his wife, Hilde, were reportedly accused of financial and ethical misconduct – which they denyThe Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter! Control of World’s Food SupplyHenry Kissinger was Schwab’s mentor at Harvard and was a frequent honored guest at World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland. Kissinger is known for his statement, “Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control people.” Rutte is a “Young Global Leader” of the World Economic Forum — like former Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and Jacinda Ardern, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook/Meta, and many others. Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum bragged that Trudeau and half his cabinet are WEF “Young Global Leaders”. By 2021, the Young Leaders were showing up as the top leadership positions in a growing number of countries including French President Emmanuel Macron and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. The Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. So, when the Dutch government tried to force 3,000 farmers out of business, it was not just affecting the food supply of The Netherlands, but of much of the world. As the two videos below show, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced that Holland is the headquarters of the “Global Food Hub”. Rutte was the Global Coordinating Secretary to Transform Food Systems and Land Use. DUTCH PM MARK RUTTE CLOSING FARMS, BUT NOW CREATING WEF FOOD HUBS “Local elections in the Netherlands have dealt a huge blow to the incumbent governing coalition, as the anti-government BBB party came out on top. So how did this all play out? Why did the pro-farmer party win? And could this spell the end for Mark Rutte?’ However, Rutte was promoted to serve as the NATO Secretary General in 2024. Is This Why David Icke Was Denied Entry To The Netherlands & Banned From The EU? David Icke’s Banned Speech Icke gave his speech (shown in the video below) on a beach near his home. Icke spoke about the Dutch government trying to force farmers to sell their farms. That affects many nations because the Netherlands is the world’s second largest food exporter. Icke spoke about Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum as an expression of the global cult taking over the world now. David Icke speech for Amsterdam peace rally that he was banned from 26 countries for trying to make David Icke delivering his speech despite being prohibited from attending the peace demonstration. Dutch War on Farmers and Cows The Dutch government wants farmers to give up their land to save the planet. The farmers are fighting back. The Netherlands wanted to ban a large number of farms on the charge that they were causing too much ammonia and nitrogen. The video below explains that nitrogen comes from the synthetic fertilizers used to grow feed for livestock. However, some Dutch farmers know regenerative farming solves those problems as confirmed in the “Common Ground” documentary further below! Common Ground, the documentary released on April 22 (International Mother Earth Day), shows the critical importance of farmers who practice regenerative agriculture. Cows play a huge role in this transformation that can help save us from the Sixth Great Extinction. Film: “Common Ground” – April 22 Globalists maintain that cows are THE cause of our existential crisis and must be reduced. However, in his famous 2013 Ted Talk below, Dr. Allan Savory, founder of Holistic Management, explains that cows are THE solution to the crisis if managed correctly – much as the Plains Indians managed the buffalo! Savory warns: “Poor land leads to poor people which leads to social breakdown”. Dr. Savory’s Ted Talk below How To Green The World’s Deserts and Reverse Climate Change is among the TOP 100 MOST-WATCHED TED TALKS. It now has 5,923,699 views. Dr. Savory explains why livestock — now used on five continents on 37 million acres — are the ONLY protection for soils and water and the ONLY way to save our civilization. He said in his talk at Harvard that this Ted Talk overcame 50 years of academic opposition to these ideas. He explains that when public opinion changes, government policy changes. So, you can help shift policies by sharing this Ted Talk and this article. How to green the world’s deserts and reverse climate change | Allan Savory 3/4/13 “Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,” begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it’s happening to about two-thirds of the world’s grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes — and his work so far shows — that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert. Book: Cows Save the Planet Amazon says: “Kristin Ohlson makes a passionate case for “our great green hope”—a way in which we can not only heal the land but also turn atmospheric carbon into beneficial soil carbon. Thousands of years of poor farming and ranching practices—and, especially, modern industrial agriculture—have led to the loss of up to 80 percent of carbon from the world’s soils. Ohlson introduces scientists, farmers, ranchers, and landscapers who are figuring how to build healthy soil, which solves myriad problems: drought, erosion, air and water pollution, and food quality.” Ohlson says Parker Bosley, a restaurateur, told her, “Carbon farming. That’s the new thing.” He said there was a new movement among small farmers. Sometimes they call themselves soil farmers or microbe farmers, aware of the billions of tiny creatures that were at work in the soil. Sometimes they call themselves carbon farmers, knowing carbon is making their soils richer, moister, and darker. Dr. Kristine Nichols, Chief Scientist, Rodale Institute, says, “In every handful of healthy soil, there are more organisms than the number of people who have ever lived on Planet Earth! Those organisms are processing organic matter in the soil and putting the nutrients into a form the plant needs.” In Soil Health – Dr. Kristine Nichols, Rodale Institute, Dr. Nichols says, “All our soils that are under chemical conventional agriculture are almost completely devoid of microorganisms.” Spraying the soils with toxic chemicals kills the microbes we need to give us health and to pull the carbon from the atmosphere. The film points out, “Taking care of the microbes in the soil is critical for human health”.Cows Save the Planet: And Other Improbable Ways of Restoring Soil to Heal the Earth shows that nature is designed to be self-healing. It explains that Allan Savory’s Holistic Management shows the central role of pasture-fed cows in saving our soils, feeding the world, providing clean water, and restoring the oceans.Allan Savory’s Holistic Management: Key To Soil RestorationRunning out of Time | Documentary on Holistic Management Allan Savory explains how he used Holistic Management to transform his land in Zimbabwe. David Icke Explains Trump’s Globalist PlansPresident Trump with his plan to “Make America Great Again”, is seen as the world’s leading nationalist.However, in the podcast below with Charlie Robinson (host of Macroaggressions Podcast and owner/operator of Activist Post and Natural Blaze), Icke explains Trump’s globalist plans. #531: And The Truth Shall Set You Free | David Icke Icke’s BooksIcke has written dozens of books in the last 30+ years. Icke’s 2024 book The Reveal: The Next Stage of Human Awareness is the third in his trilogy which was preceded by his 2022 book The Trap and his 2023 book Dream, The: The Extraordinary Revelation Of Who We Are And Where We Are. Amazon Description“David Icke has been writing books for decades warning that current events were coming. He has faced ridicule and abuse for saying that the end of human freedom was being planned, how, and by whom. David Icke’s The Biggest Secret, first published in 1998, has been called the ‘Rosetta Stone’ of the conspiracy movement for the way it exposed how the pieces fit and the nature of the force behind human control.The Trap is the ‘Rosetta Stone’ of illusory reality and opens the door to freedom in its greatest sense. Read this book and the ‘world’ will never look the same again. The veil of illusion shall be swept aside and the amazing truth this has kept from us shall set you free.” The Mainstream Alternative Media (MAM) Icke explains that globalists use the following primary means to control the world’s 8 billion people: Icke quotes Vladimir Lenin to explains how the globalists are handling the challenge by the Alt Media: “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves. Icke shows that many politicians, podcast hosts, etc.) who appear to oppose globalization are either dupes or are complicit.The Reveal: The Next Stage of Human Awareness provides a depth of insight into what’s really going on and why. The book discusses many of the icons of what Icke calls the “Mainstream Alternative Media”. He explains that Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson, Russell Brand, James O’Keefe (Founder of Project Veritas), Candace Owens, Don Bongino, Andrew Tate, Rumble are part pf the “controlled opposition”. Icke also calls out Mark Zuckerberg, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Mark Andreessen who founded Netscape, Bret Weinstein, and Eric Weinstein. AI Replacing Humans / Fake Food Bill Gates now owns more American farmland than anyone else — 242,000 acres across 18 states.He has been pushing the idea of “fake meat” and eating bugs!What’s the Obsession with Getting Us to Eat Food that Isn’t Real Food? – Activist PostRICH MAN, POOR FARMER: Bill Gates buys up farmland while promoting fake meat Bill Gates: Within 10 Years, Humans Won’t Be Needed ‘For Most Things’ Bill Gates says AI will replace doctors, teachers within 10 years — and claims humans won’t be needed ‘for most things’ Bill Gates announces the long-awaited change to the workweek: We should be working “just like 2 or 3 days a week”172,017 Job Cuts In One Month – Mass Layoffs Rise To A Level That We Haven’t Seen Since The Great Recession Elon Musk: Soft Sell For AI Icke warns that Elon Musk has fooled many people – especially podcast hosts in the Mainstream Alternative Media – that he is a good guy because he apparently facilitated more free speech when he bought Twitter (now “X”). However, Icke warns that Musk is the soft sell for AI to get people to trust the next steps which will ultimately be devastating for humanity. Icke explains that Elon Musk is part of the globalist Cult which plans direct control of our thinking by merging our brains with Artificial Intelligence. He says the “Smart Grid” with the Internet of Things will become the Internet of Everything – including the human mind. Icke explains that if we take our power back, eight billion people can’t be controlled by a tiny cabal. Icke’s goal is to wake up enough people now to the true nature of our reality to save humanity.

Title: UPS To Lay Off 20,000 Workers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2025/04/30/ups-to-lay-off-20000-workers/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T18:22:07Z
Full Content:
BySteve Banker BySteve Banker, Contributor. A Teamster employee delivering a package for UPS Amidst falling consumer confidence - the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since 2011 - United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) announced it is laying off 20,000 workers. UPS believes that they are the world’s largest package delivery company. The logistics industry is considered a bellwether industry that can provide an advanced warning of a recession. Does the massive layoff at UPS signal that bad times are coming? UPS announced the layoff during its first quarter 2025 earnings call on Tuesday. In addition to laying off 20,000 employees, the company plans to close 73 buildings by the end of June and reduce the total number of hours devoted to operations by their workers by 25 million. Carol Tomé, the CEO of UPS, also commented that uncertainty surrounding global trade policies led to a drop in consumer confidence and muted demand from some larger customers, but particularly from their small and medium-sized customers. In terms of average daily shipping volumes, this drop in what they forecast occurred in February and March as the tariff turmoil increased. The company forecasts that its cost-saving measures will lead to $3.5 billion in cost reductions in 2025. Roughly 35% of the cost savings will come from the layoff. The Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien reacted to the announcement by pointing out that UPS “is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under our current national master agreement. If the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.” The economic news is not as bad as it first appears. While the layoff had not been announced, the company had announced a plan to reduce its reliance on Amazon as a customer. Amazon is their largest customer. The company reached an agreement with Amazon to reduce its volume in its network by more than 50% by June 2026. “The volume we are transitioning out (of) is Amazon's fulfillment center outbound volume,” Ms. Tomé explained. “This volume is not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network. The Amazon volume we plan to keep is profitable.” Secondly, the layoffs are also driven, in part, by new automation. The company had announced a Network of the Future initiative. UPS is automating sortation, using robotics for automatic label applications, and automating the unloading and loading of trailers. 64% of their volume went through automated facilities in the first quarter. That is an improvement of about four and a half percent year over year. In addition to reducing costs, UPS believes that automation will improve its ability to better handle shifts in volume and regional shifts in shipping. UPS imports of roughly 400,000 pieces per day into the U.S. Last year, revenue on its China to U.S. trade lane represented 11% of their international revenue. The China to U.S. trade lanes are UPS’s most profitable lanes. The change to the de minimis rule, which exempted shipments that had a value of less than $800 from tariffs, had been expected to have a significant impact on freight forwarders and parcel consolidators. That change is having an effect. “We've talked with our top 100 customers to understand how their business is being impacted, both directly and indirectly, by changes in trade policy,” Ms. Tomé said. “These customers have told us that they are exploring various options to address the tariffs.” These range from absorbing the cost, to increasing retail prices to reflect the increase in tariff costs, to asking suppliers to help defray the expense. “At this point, it remains an open question as to what path they will choose and what the potential impact could be on consumer demand and our business.” Through the middle of April, this logistics behemoth interviewed nearly 45,000 international and freight forwarding customers to ascertain their shipping plans. “For small package shippers,” the CEO explained, “over 95% of those customers have told us that they expect to maintain the current business model, while the rest are considering several options, including trade shifts, transportation mode shifts, or exiting the business.” These customers also told UPS they are pursuing a wait-and-see strategy by selling down their current inventory. This will hurt UPS’s shipping volumes in the short term, but the company expects it to rebound as its customers begin sourcing outside of China and shipping on other trade lanes. Navigating the complexities surrounding tariffs can be a nightmare for shippers. This complexity can benefit UPS. UPS has developed technology that makes it easier for its customers to reclassify goods under Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes. Further, Ms. Tomé said, “our new global checkout product makes it known what customers will pay for duties, taxes, and fees.” Its checkout technology enables UPS’s customers to display to their customers a guaranteed blended cost – a cost that covers all duties, taxes, and fees - during online checkouts. “Global checkout is available in 43 origin countries, and UPS is the only global carrier that offers a guaranteed landed cost that's integrated into shipping and billing technology.” Finally, for its customers exploring new trade options, UPS provides bonded warehousing. Bonded warehouses are in designated Foreign Trade Zones. A foreign-trade zone is a designated location in the United States where companies can use special customs procedures that can be used to delay or reduce duty payments on foreign merchandise. “The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years. So, the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any of our scenarios will play out,” the CEO exclaimed. “But by modeling different scenarios, we'll be able to adjust to rapid shifts in the business.” Because of the uncertainty, UPS is not providing full-year guidance to financial analysts.

Title: Amazon and Saks Fifth Avenue launch luxury e-commerce storefront

Let Fashion Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The partnership will feature an assortment of high-end men’s and women’s brands, including Balmain, Stella McCartney and Fear of God. Amazon has been trying to break into luxury fashion since at least 2020, but for the most part, the e-commerce giant has struggled to connect with clothes-conscious consumers. Even Amazon Haul, the company’s fast fashion offering launched last year, has so far failed to bring in the same level of customer excitement as competitors such as Shein and Temu. With this new venture, Amazon may have found a partner with enough name recognition to finally capture elite online shoppers. Jenny Freshwater, vice president of Amazon Fashion, Fitness and Creators, said in the release that Amazon customers want to shop more high-end brands. “This collaboration with Saks furthers Amazon’s commitment to supporting the luxury industry and increasing our assortment for customers, while maintaining an elevated shopping experience that meets the varying tastes of our diverse customer base,” said Freshwater, who took over Amazon’s Fashion and Fitness division in 2023. Initial brands in the storefront include Dolce&Gabbana, Balmain, Etro, Stella McCartney, Giambattista Valli, Erdem, Fear of God, Jason Wu Collection, Rosetta Getty, Johanna Ortiz, Chantecaille and La Prairie, per the release. More labels will be added following the launch, although the release did not specify additional brand names. “This collaboration underscores Saks Fifth Avenue’s reputation as a leader in luxury curation, as well as our commitment to reinventing luxury shopping so that each customer’s experience is unmistakably their own,” Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer at Saks Global, said in the release. “We are delighted to collaborate with an incredible group of forward-thinking brand partners for launch, and we look forward to expanding selection with additional brands as we evolve the experience.” An editorial campaign accompanying the launch was directed by Max Siedentopf, and the online storefront is also being promoted via a window installation at the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship store. Saks Global, parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off Fifth, completed its acquisition of the Neiman Marcus Group, which includes Bergdorf Goodman, in January. Following the close of the deal, Saks Global announced multiple rounds of layoffs, including job eliminations resulting from the closure of a fulfillment center earlier this month.

More workers who've been laid off compete for the same positions. Between a slowing economy, an influx of former federal workers looking for new jobs and an overall tightening labor market, the job prospects for 2025 graduates aren’t looking too bright. While college students across the country will sit for their final exams in the coming weeks, the reality of life after school will likely be much different from what they expect: About 82% of students in of the class of 2025 anticipate having a full-time job three months after graduation, while only 77% of recent graduates have accomplished that, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. There is an increasing gap between those that can land a job quickly versus those taking six months or more to find a full-time gig. Nursing or health science majors should be able to find employment a bit easier, as these two sectors led employment gains in the last month. But jobs for computer science majors and software engineers have slowed—unless you have AI skills. Political science majors are also seeing their job prospects shrink. The federal government is contracting thanks to DOGE-led cuts, eliminating early-career fellowships and other opportunities for thousands across the country. For the government jobs left at the state and local level, recent grads are likely competing with those departing from federal jobs. To make matters worse, internships aren’t converting to full-time employment as frequently as before, according to a survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Still, graduates are optimistic: About 83% said they were confident in their job prospects after commencement, according to a Monster report. We’ll keep our eyes out for this week’s upcoming labor report to see exactly what 2025 grads will be facing. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Instead of rage quitting, try these four tactics before ruining your career. Go the extra mile and more tips on getting an entry-level role without previous experience.

More push their bosses to adopt the same mindset. AI use is becoming an increasingly important part of work. From taking courses on “AI skills” to AI agents that should increase our productivity, companies are pushing for AI adoption at different rates. The most proactive have been coined “frontier firms” by a new Microsoft work trends report. I spoke with report author and senior research director Alexia Cambon about what this means for employees outside of frontier firms and how workers can advocate for more AI use. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. The adoption task seems pretty straightforward for workers at “frontier firms.” But what happens to those working at companies behind the curve? Your organization needs you to become a frontier firm employee, even if it’s not a frontier firm. I see this even within my own team. So for example, I have a data scientist who’s the best data scientist in the world. But we are also actively bringing in all the data science tools you can imagine that allow me to rely less on him for data science. Our entire relationship is about data science, so that naturally raises questions. For him, it’s: “What does that mean for the work I do?” I have never seen anyone go after AI and agents as quickly or as hungrily as this man. He has literally built half of the agents for you. He’s gone out and experimented with everything left, right, and center. Ultimately, we need him desperately. Even if his data science skills can be done through agents, his ingenuity and figuring out how agents can be used for data science, I need that from him. So that’s what I would say to employees reading the report and wondering, “What does this mean for me? I don’t work in a frontier firm.” Just last year’s report saw that employees were bringing AI to work, whether it was secret or not. We need employees to do that and force the conversation, because that is the type of employee that will be most needed. One that is really hungry to go out there and initiate the change. That’s a big shift from last year, right? Now employers, instead of workers, are pushing AI adoption. Where is this coming from? I think it just points to the fact that business demands are increasing because the pace is accelerating so quickly. At the level it’s at now, it is just too fast for humans alone to deal with, especially with this emphasis on productivity and efficiency, and we’re not running out of work. It’s funny, there are these conflicting tensions of people being terrified that AI is coming for their jobs and that we’re not going to have any jobs left, versus organizations needing productivity, needing more capacity. I personally don’t think we’re running out of work. I don’t think we’ll ever run out of work to do. We live in an age of convenience––everything is available at the press of a button! And work is a constant balance of energy. You probably have types of work that really drain you of energy and types of work that really energize you and make you excited and happy. We don’t wanna spend our energy budget on the types of work that drain us. That’s what AI is here to do––to lift the mundane out of our work. So how can employees master these “AI skills” to make their work life easier? I wouldn’t say there’s any one right way, the outcomes will dictate what works best. But I think there’s a responsibility on every employee to take full advantage of the training that their company is providing. And if the company isn’t providing any training, then shout out from the rooftops and say that if we wanna stay relevant and competitive we need to train the entire workforce to have these skills. We see the beginnings of AI usage becoming part of performance reviews or job development considerations. So the infrastructure will continue to grow around this to really incentivize people to use it, the same way today we can’t imagine doing, say our taxes, without the internet.

Title: Trump’s tariff fiasco has even his own treasury secretary flailing

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Before his second term began, President Donald Trump said that tariffs were “not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.” He said they will make a “great economy.” He said they “will MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.” That was the plan, anyway. Trump is a good salesman, and he has found buyers for a lot of junk over the years, from steaks to supplements to degrees from Trump University. But this time the sales job is failing. Though many voters unfortunately believed his pitch through the 2024 presidential election, more and more of the public has figured out that tariffs don’t work the way Trump claims, especially when they’re so haphazard and unpredictable that what the administration is doing can barely be called a “policy.” Remarkably, they have reached those conclusions even before tariffs really start to increase prices, empty shop shelves and hurt the wider economy. When that happens, a bad start for Trump 2.0 could become a political catastrophe. The MAGA faithful may still trust the president on the economy, but the rest of the country doesn’t. Already, most Americans don’t trust Trump’s handling of the economy. Only 35% of respondents in a CNN poll approved of his handling of tariffs. An ABC News/Washington Post poll put the number at 34%, with 7 in 10 people saying tariffs will drive up inflation. An NPR/PBS/Marist poll pegged approval of Trump’s handling of the economy as a whole at 39%, while a Reuters/Ipsos poll had him at 37% on that question. Consumer confidence has dropped to its lowest level since the start of the Covid pandemic. In other words, the MAGA faithful may still trust the president on the economy, but the rest of the country doesn’t.One didn’t have to be familiar with those numbers to get the picture from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flailing in a Tuesday morning news conference as he tried to reconcile all the contradictory impulses and goals of the president’s ever-changing tariff policy. Bessent claimed that Trump was cleverly deploying “strategic uncertainty” to keep other countries off guard. “I think that tariffs will bring back American manufacturing and generate substantial revenues,” he added. But it’s impossible to negotiate with someone who won’t say what he wants from other countries or keeps changing those asks. Even the two goals Bessent stated are in direct conflict. If tariffs bring back American manufacturing, that means consumers will be buying American-made goods, which means less tariff revenue. If they bring in substantial revenues, it means consumers are continuing to buy foreign-made goods and American manufacturing languishes. Even a statement of fact about how tariffs generate revenue is enough to send the administration into a rage. Early Tuesday morning, Punchbowl News reported that Amazon would follow other companies in showing customers exactly how much increased prices are the result of the administration’s tariffs. Such a move would be very public evidence against the administration’s contention that tariffs generate revenue not as costs passed on to consumers, but as money from thin air. At Tuesday’s news conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded with characteristic vitriol. “I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon’s announcement,” she told reporters, “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.” According to NBC News, Trump even made a personal call to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to complain about the report. The company later said that it had considered breaking out tariff charges on its low-priced Amazon Haul site, but decided against it. At least Bezos and his businesses won’t be targeted for revenge by Trump (for now). Amid his verbal squirming in Tuesday’s news conference, Bessent offered a perhaps unintended revelation. But no amount of spin will matter if Americans see the effects of the tariffs in their own lives. While nothing is certain and economic conditions can always change, it sure looks like we’re headed for bad times. Bookings on container ships coming to the U.S. have already dropped significantly, suggesting the possibility of shortages; the Port of Los Angeles says shipping volume will be down 35% starting next week. Business investment is “paralyzed,” write Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Steven Tian of the Yale School of Management, as companies wait to see whether the tariffs will go up or down, or just disappear. Investment firm Apollo Global Management now forecasts a chain of events — imports slowing, trucking company layoffs, empty shelves and consumer pullback — that culminates in a recession by this summer. Major Wall Street firms place the chance of a recession this year between 40% and 65%. Amid his verbal squirming in Tuesday’s news conference, Bessent offered a perhaps unintended revelation. “President Trump is interested in the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past,” the secretary said. “We don’t need to necessarily have a booming textile industry like where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that back.” But textiles and other low-cost goods that rely on cheap foreign labor are subject to Trump’s tariffs, which means higher prices for consumers even if Americans won’t ever make those products again. And while precision manufacturing is great, it tends to be much more automated, which requires a smaller number of highly skilled employees. That means Americans won’t be working in that kind of factory by the tens of millions. In other words, Bessent accidentally summed up the effects of Trump’s tariffs: we’ll pay higher prices, but get little in return. Even before we feel the worst of it, Americans already understand. They aren’t happy and, if a recession comes, Trump will really feel their wrath. Paul Waldman is a journalist and author whose writing has appeared in dozens of publications.

Pre-script: Reader and now close friend Phil Giammattei could use some help with a horrible brush with cancer in the family. You can support him here. Update: You all crushed Phil's goal, thank you so much for your generosity. Things are obviously Extremely Bad in many parts of the world right now, and it's wonderfully refreshing to see people pull together, even if it is for a degenerate like Phil. I'd also like to take a moment to curse the person that dethroned me from my spot of Top Donation, and to double-curse them for doing it anonymously, embarrassing me further. Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me 'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here The most treasured object in my home is the cheapest bookshelf I could find. It has been overflowing for quite some time, despite my efforts to only buy books of exceptional quality and relegating the rest to my kindle. Many of the books are unread, but that hasn't stopped me from adding to the pile1. My partner has gracefully accepted that I will stop at every bookstore that looks remotely interesting, and patiently reminds me that my past-self has issued strict orders to my current-self to stop acquiring tomes until I have space for a second bookshelf. Over time, I have dropped from buying a book a week to one every month, which represents a spectacular effort for me. Despite the gradual development of what I'd like to think of as iron will, I caved upon stumbling across this particular edition of A Wizard of Earthsea. This was a repudiation of all that hard-won bookshelf space saving. I had read A Wizard of Earthsea when I was thirteen, and I didn't really get it. It was a book about wizards. So what? It was slow and ponderous, and my teenage self knew that an interesting wizard should be firing lightning bolts at dragons. But the illustration on this copy of the book was so gorgeous that I bought it anyway. It was only when I slotted it into my bookshelf, and it was fully juxtaposed against the others, that I realized how hideous so many of my other books were. I treasure their contents, but consider the first two books I pulled at random from the shelf. The Robin Hobb book on the left is generally beautiful, but it is done a disservice by the George R.R Martin quote splayed across the front cover, its marketing payload expended the moment I purchased the book, but which I am nonetheless obligated to look at for the next thirty years. Almost all my books are thus marred. And this is, sadly, a relatively tasteful example compared to much of the competition. Consider instead the copy of American Gods on the right, sweet merciful Christ, it is a truly repulsive abomination2. Just look at it. The quote at the top is George R. R. Martin once again, which says something about what marketing departments think is impactful. In the top right, we see Ian McShane, which is incredibly jarring because I know him only for his role in John Wick. Along the bottom we have the tedious "No. 1 Bestselling Author". And most offensively, thanks to the screaming red bubble, my descendants will forever know that this precious artefact handed down from their great grandfather once had a no-doubt mediocre second season on Amazon Prime, whatever the fuck an "Amazon Prime" is. Did they turn the rainforest into a cinema when they were done destroying it? Upon closer inspection, my bookshelf is riddled with tasteless advertising smuggled into my home by boring marketing departments, and I am not open to arguments that this meaningfully boosts sales. Some people might have differing taste, but this is bland to the point of nothingness. At least erotica has the decency to slap a shirtless hunk on there, and we can envision the target demographic. Not a shred of this crassness is evident in this copy of A Wizard of Earthsea, and some part of me thought "This is Quality", and amidst the shrieking cacophony of the other titles ("New York Times Bestseller! Twilight Meets Game Of Thrones! Breathtaking!"), it is the one I walked away with. It is now one of my favourite books. A Wizard of Earthsea is a towering work of genius. Going back to it now that I'm older, I must simply accept that my teenage judgement was... well, a teenager's judgement. It is beautifully written, wise, and it does not feel the need to overstay its welcome with contemporary notions of how long a book should be. The writing speaks for itself: "You want to work spells,'"Ogion said presently, striding along. "You've drawn too much water from that well. Wait. Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine times patience." He spoke softly and his eyes were somber as he looked at Ged. "You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man’s real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do..." While it was not a given, it is not surprising that the gentleness of the prose is matched perfectly with the elegance of the overall presentation. What was surprising is that cracking open the book reveals an introduction from Le Guin herself, specifically lamenting the immense difficulty she had over the years in simply getting artwork done which was not at terrible odds with the contents. ... until very recently, the books of Earthsea had no illustrations. This was partly my own decision. After Ruth's unique wraparound jacket for the first edition of A Wizard of Earthsea — with its splendidly stylized, copper-brown portrait face — cover art for the books mostly went out of my control. This is the beautiful cover to which Le Guin is referring. Le Guin continues: The results could be ghastly — the droopy, lily-white wizard of the first Puffin UK paperback;... ...the silly man with sparks shooting out of his fingers that replaced him... ... I was ashamed of the covers that gave the reader every wrong idea about the people and the place. I resented publishers' art departments that met any suggestion that the cover might resemble something or someone in the book by rejecting it, informing me loftily that they Knew what would Sell (a mystery that no honest cover designer would ever claim to know). Let us take a moment to appreciate how funny those covers are, and then take another moment to soak up some secondhand embarrassment — somewhere, alive or dead, there are people that told fucking Le Guin how to go about her business, to turn her characters from brown-skinned to white, who perhaps even rejected some early manuscripts. And at least some of them must be aware that Ursula K. Le Guin took a moment to personally light them the fuck up in the foreword of one of the most famous books of all time. This is not the first time that I've seen people in the publishing industry complain about the narrow-mindedness of their peers. Consider the afterword from my copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which includes a letter from Pirsig's original editor, James Landis, who went to immense lengths to have the book published: The book is not, as I think you now realize from your correspondence with other publishers, a marketing man's dream, and if our particular variety of that species... tries to make trouble over the book, I'll just have to supply what pressure I can to overrule him: I'm determined to fight this thing through to the end you and I desire... No sense in trying to kid you by pretending that the book is 'commercial' in the way that term is understood by most people in publishing... However, I have ultimate faith in the book's being good, valuable, which gets us into standards beyond commercial and gets us also into what, to my mind, publishing is all about. That was from the 40th anniversary reprinting. We could speculate about the unknown unknowns — perhaps there are thousands of James Landis' out there, and we are witnessing the one who survived. It is surely possible to publish a phenomenal book and have it be ignored. But for my money, what happened is that Landis has real taste, and that while the modern economy sometimes appears to be filled entirely by bullshit, that only makes it easier for quality to win out if you're willing to stake something on it. But it doesn't come easily, because if you want to do anything interesting, and probably weird, you will immediately be besieged, from within and without, by tedious people and tired ideas. Getting permission from people without soul in the game is oppressive. Consider the final line from Landis above: However, I have ultimate faith in the book's being good, valuable, which gets us into standards beyond commercial and gets us also into what, to my mind, publishing is all about. If you run into Landis and his ilk, perhaps you can do something interesting. You have someone in your corner, who will perhaps take a risk on your behalf, because while they may preserve the skin they have in the game by refusing to be weird in front of their peers, they have to choose between that and their soul. But you will probably not run into Landis. You will probably meet the typical editor, who would be delighted if you offered to write Grit meets The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck3. You will meet the real estate agent who will never be swayed by considerations other than the size of your bank account, or the government bureaucrat who will decide that you cannot immigrate because you are two days below the age of 23, or some other tasteless and impotent cog. Even consider startups, a community replete with people who jerk themselves off to the label of entrepreneur so hard that they're at risk of permanent groinal damage. And because we do work with some startups, I will make apologies to the twelve sane startup founders out there.4 It's distressing how many young people are under the impression that startups are where you go to innovate and assert yourself. You're young, full of optimism, and have minimal obligations. Your only real weakness is your lack of experience, and it is with that inexperience that you... you sign a deal with people who are possibly dozens of years your senior in cunning, law, and finance? To play games on their terms, where you're a total loser if the business earns just enough money to live comfortably on your own terms? Where you have to justify your decisions, where they can pressure you to sell more of your equity, and ultimately appoint a new CEO if you make a misstep? But I digress. To continue the theme of publishing, last year I was approached by an editor at a mid-tier publisher. I made sure to read some of the editor's short stories before our first meeting, and it turned out they were themselves a talented writer with a real passion for the craft. In fact, while looking up the link to the article above, I discovered they published a book as recently as 2024. And they wanted to help me get published! My name, on a book! I knew that it was unlikely to do any significant sales, as blog-writing and book-writing are two very different skills, but still! A book! Things progress well over the next few days, and it turns out the editor shared many of my frustrations with how companies run. Just as it looked like I was going to sign on, the sales team comes with their Opinions, and I must sadly say that they were not sophisticated Opinions. To begin with, they wanted to stipulate that swearing was absolutely not allowed before knowing anything else about me or what we wanted to write. I wasn't actually intending to swear much, if at all, but I also saw no need to limit myself up front. Why agree to play left-handed before we've even tried out the game? More conditions are added. They will not even guarantee that they'll try to get it on bookshelves. I reach out to some other people who have published with them, they reveal that they were forced to write their entire book in Microsoft Word templates. Communications were confused and unclear. Even the payments were described as "opaque". Basically everything you would expect out of the typical tech project. A picture begins to emerge, of a serious editor trying to do their best, surrounded by colleagues who are about as unserious as anything I've described in the tech world. Nothing surprising, but still, why not self-publish? An editor and an artist will only run a few thousand dollars, a tiny investment compared to the time it takes to write a book, and whatever I lack in experience can be compensated for with giving a shit. To quote one of my co-founders, Jordan Andersen, it's only arrogant if you're wrong5. In the meantime though, I frequently find myself reflecting on how bizarre the knee-jerk "no swearing" rule was. Sure, there are always going to be some concessions to be made to marketing. I don't just label all my posts "Unnamed Post #7", because I would like to be read at least a little bit. But swearing? Who gives a shit? Is that really going to be the difference between a good book and a bad book? Why on earth would you hear that you've got someone interested in writing a book whose writing is doing millions of hits that very week and then immediately tell them that you know what will sell better than they will? In fact, the only other book they've got that's well-known enough for me to recognize it has swearing in it, so I know it isn't even a principled brand stance. A midwit just went "I am slightly self-conscious about how I appear to my boss" and that was enough to tank the whole thing. I will never stop citing Sturgeon's Law. Ninety percent of everything is crud. That is to say, ninety percent of everything is crud to a practitioner who has taken the time to develop judgement. That is to say there is some distribution of judgement and bravery, and a whole lot of people are clumped in one not-very-good batch. These days, when people become concerned about the seeming arrogance in that statement, I point them at real estate agents and say: "That's how bad many professionals are, but you can only tell when the issue is as blatant as a broken window in your living room." I still have not met a professional whose competence I've been able to verify that will not endorse something close to Sturgeon's Law. The best I've been able to manage is that, if you ignore all secondary attributes required for a job such as empathy, communication skills, maturity, and restrict yourself purely to the mechanical task at hand, some medical subspecialties are consistently okay... but with all those caveats, you'd still never want them to be your physician. In all fields, very weak practitioners seem to cling to a series of practices or principles without a nuanced understanding of why they're doing those things. Consider, for example, a junior engineer. The trajectory of the typical junior engineer is that they will hear a principle like Don't Repeat Yourself, and immediately begin writing functions to generalize two pieces of code that even look similar. This is normal and even admirable — it is a single-objective optimization problem, and they're optimizing! Junior engineers are supposed to be weak practitioners, but this person is trying. They will then become slightly more sophisticated, and learn about premature abstraction, and suddenly we have two principles that are in conflict. Collapsing duplicated code means you are Not Repeating Yourself, but you are probably introducing an abstraction, and now you have a tradeoff between two principles6. And if you keep going, you will pick up dozens to hundreds of these, implicit and explicit, and must become comfortable with the fact that you're going to have to balance them all simultaneously via the application of judgement, and you will be wrong sometimes. With all that nuance comes the boon and burden of being able to disregard principles. For example, we use Test Driven Development, but I was recently working on something that required spinning up a headless Chrome browser to convert a HTML document to a PDF. Unfortunately, this is very slow in a test suite and annoying in some CI/CD products for various reasons. Because I have an idea about why I test, and what the value of it is, and how likely this is to break, I made the decision to just not test that bit of the application when running tests in GitHub Actions. Will I regret that? Maybe, probably, but the point is that my rules are there for reasons and sometimes those reasons don't feel like they apply.7 Truly weak practitioners will come to you with totally degenerate rules or principles. This is the "no swearing" publisher, but it is also the "no dogs" landlord, the "no risk" security guy, the "must have ten years of Git experience" recruiter and I've no doubt that everyone reading this can think of at least one system where they've thought "I can't believe I'm at the mercy of a person that isn't even thinking". Frequently their rules are not even rules, they're just phrases that competent people used to say, and eventually they became well-known enough to become fake-able signal. Data-driven. Garbage in, garbage out. Agile. All of these may have previously signalled novel thought, and now anyone that's really savvy does their best to not use the phrases because they know how tacky it makes them look, even if they actually use them in meaningful ways. This can even happen when you've bypassed the large, visible, external gatekeepers, such as recruiters. All it takes is one person within an organization that loves talking and again lacks that baseline competency. One of my co-founders, Ash Lally, the infamous Business Jaguar8, was on a contract outside the context of our consultancy recently. They are tasked with pulling data from one system into another system, which is about the most boring and typical thing that a data engineer can do. The employer is not technologically advanced and this task is not their core competency, so as is the case for almost all work in this category, the solution is to schedule some code to run once every ten minutes to pull it in. They are working with someone that, to steal the words of a reader, has had a very impressive career in numeric terms, i.e, they're terrible at their job, but boy oh boy have they been doing it for a long time. Ash's counterpart considers pulling the data in every ten minutes, then comes back with: "Event-driven is good for internal system integration." Event-driven means that instead of writing something very simple to grab all new data every ten minutes, you instead write a very bespoke system that detects new events in real-time and copies it over to the target system. This is way more complicated and totally unsuitable for a company that hasn't figured out version control yet. And also totally unproductive, because the data can't be used without another piece of data which has a hard limit of being calculated... once every ten minutes. So the company still has a ten minute delay before anything can be used, plus all the insane overhead. But still, we should hear them out, why is event-driven good for system integration? I can think of some reasons, but I'll never know if they're the reasons this person had in mind, because that information is not forthcoming! They heard those words somewhere from someone authoritative-sounding and they now feel comfortable regurgitating them at other people. But we're going event-driven now! Bonus points, this infrastructure supports emergency services, so you can commit stochastic murder this way! It's like serial killing but you've tricked a whole department into being your co-conspirators! Even when you've passed all the normal gatekeepers, you will sometimes need permission to do the engineering equivalent of tying your shoelaces correctly.9 Above, I talk about people who have even gotten as far as misapplying principles. As frustrating as that is, that isn't even the worst you can do. Some people never reflect on their craft at all, or do not view it as a craft. The person that says "event-driven is good for internal systems integration" has at least taken a moment to read something, even if it's a terrible LinkedIn post or a Medium blog. Things can get so, so much worse. Remember all your peers at university that would say "I dream of working in HR"? No, probably not, because that sentence has possibly never been uttered in all of human existence. The field is laden to the point of breaking with people that drifted into it because it was the first job they could get that paid white-collar wages for a qualification no more sophisticated than knowing where some of the buttons are in Workday. Some of them, by dint of personality and ethics, are good at their jobs, but they are few and far between, and perhaps most importantly are not systematically produced. Is it actually a surprise, under those conditions, that HR seems to be useless whenever you interact with them? Could we expect any other outcome? It's a testament to the power that so many of them have relinquished to the economy, by dint of being unemployable on the grounds of technical skill or competence, that they bother to get out of bed at all. They don't want to be there any more than you want them there. Jordan, the same co-founder responsible for "it's only arrogant if you're wrong", wrote a single blog post on our company website. During a meeting where Jordan asked for some feedback, we spent some time caught up on this little snippet. I just want to pause and note how fucked this was. While I was an accredited allied health professional at the time, it's fucking ridiculous that a bunch of recreationists were put in charge of dictating how anyone should respond to a medical emergency... And here's what the team was split on — do we swear on the company blog? You can probably figure out where I set on the issue. Go for it! What are you, some sort of coward? But the team wasn't sure, and the truth is that I wasn't entirely sure either. Maybe I can get away with that on my personal blog, but is that too crass? I mean, some people feel it's already too crass here. Will people be scared to take us to their managers? And most importantly, other consultancies aren't doing this, should we be more like them? Eventually, Ricky Ling chimes in (I'm sorry there are so many of us), and his take for Jordan is the Quality-focused take. "If you think it makes the writing better, do it". We still aren't sure, but we know that we didn't quit our jobs and give up all that sweet, sweet salary to be cowards, so we do it. That single post has generated us a huge amount of outreach from cool people despite not going viral or being widely circulated as far as I know, and we almost started prematurely neutering it because a group of people who already deviate wildly were still worried about doing something even a little bit different. Being seen to deviate is extremely hard, in large part because to deviate is to be seen, and the gaze of others is deeply uncomfortable. There's an exercise that actors do, where they sit in two chairs opposite each other, make eye contact, and then one of them just starts saying things that they're feeling. "I am aware that my hands are warm." "I am aware that I am uncomfortable with you staring at me." "I am aware that I want to burst out laughing." This is very, very uncomfortable to do. I've done it three times, for about ten minutes each time, and I cannot emphasize how much we all hated it. From this we can infer that actors are total fucking weirdos, but also that acting as a field has identified that there is something deep to unpack in reflecting on what it is like to be perceived without the luxury of flinching or breaking eye contact. This aversion to deviation and subsequent perception is enough to make some people totally impotent. In the earlier days of the consultancy, I envisioned that our sales pipeline would be something like this: This sometimes does happen, but it has never happened at a company without a really spectacular culture. What happens at the average company or government agency is something to the effect of: "I am working on a project, and we're being scammed by some other consultants. The whole thing is months late, and it isn't going to finish any time soon. Is there any chance you can help out?" I reply, "Yeah, of course, we'd love to. But we'd need an introduction to someone inside the company who might be willing to admit that something is wrong." And this is where, every single time, the person that initially reached out has decided that they don't want to take the risk of being visible. I understand — a lowly engineer suggesting an external consultancy with hot takes is really, really unusual, especially so if they present hard-to-ignore and inconvenient evidence that a project is failing. It has possibly never happened to the average CTO across their entire career. The engineer would be as visible as it is possible to be, perhaps moreso than if they hauled off and punched someone in the face, and during the next round of layoffs they will either be promoted for being weird or fired for being weird. In either case, redundancy is no longer dependent on who is at the top of the list when the CFO sorts the salary column on a spreadsheet by descending. In the past year, I've seen people have huge impacts at companies by exerting some bravery. This sometimes means getting a bully fired, sometimes it means getting the first tech project to work smoothly in a decade. In some of these cases, the person involved was made redundant shortly afterwards for interfering with people's selfish political aims, and other times they were promoted for actually giving a damn (and yes, sometimes for unknowingly helping someone else's selfish political aims). But all of them went in willing to put something on the line. A huge number of employees will venture nothing for their beliefs, and while that is fine or whatever, bla bla bla, they have kids, they're also going to be largely ineffective because they won't change anything big, because big change is novel and weird, and novel and weird might get you noticed, and getting noticed means something is going to happen to you. Our company is really into weird stuff. Our favourite TTRPG is Burning Wheel, an extremely niche product, hundreds of pages long, whose creator refused to release a PDF for years because he felt that it watered down the experience. Our favourite traditional board game is Twilight Imperium, a sci-fi masterpiece that takes thirteen hours to play. For internal projects, we program Elixir, a language with near-zero name recognition amongst engineering genpop that compiles to Erlang, a language developed in the 80s by Ericsson of all places. We're an Extreme Programming shop. Most of my spend this year has been learning material and one-on-one coaching for engineers in the company. We started with six co-founders, something that caused several banks a great deal of consternation when we tried to open our account, and I am now realizing makes it very hard to write blog posts without introducing what must feel to a reader like an endless stream of new names. It gets stranger. We pair program on all work10. We have no network drive, just Git repositories where all documentation is written in Markdown, and the proposals that must go to clients are converted to HTML so we can style them with CSS. AI? Not only do we not turn on AI-assistance during programming, we'll crucify each other for copying a StackOverflow example if we can't explain the behaviour with reference to code or core documentation. We contracted Mira Welner this year, internet famous for frontpaging Hackernews a few times as a fresh grad, who described our work as "the opposite of vibe programming", which will make different people have wildly different opinions about whether we're competent. We invite our clients to sip from the Chalice of Madness, wherein we pray that they will find that the Kool-aid is delicious and refreshing, amen. If there is a conventional script for something, we have probably thrown it out the window or seriously considered it. I'm obviously convinced that these practices are good or I wouldn't be doing them, but they have a secondary characteristic that may be more valuable than their originally envisioned purpose. They filter out shoddy, default thinking, and otherwise shake people into vivid awareness. Everyone is constantly immersed in weirdness, and that makes the next piece of weirdness less scary. I mean, we may still fail as a business for many reasons, but it won't be because we weren't thinking, it'll be because we had stupid thoughts, which at least has the virtue of meaning we actually tried. If you had a company policy of "we only hire people that can pass an interview about Burning Wheel rules", I suspect you would hire a stronger team than what the average company manages. At least they'll have something in common and they've demonstrated refined taste in one area. I don't even care if they can program, they'll figure it out. Iroh: What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him? Zuko: First, I have to get it out of here. Iroh: And then what? You never think these things through! Some years ago, I knew a man that was laid up in hospital for a chronic illness. He was not having a good time, but it must be admitted that some of this bad time was the product of a long-running pattern of poor life decisions. C’est la vie. In any case, one day he is having a particularly bad day, and he messages me from the hospital. He's going to leave and pick up a pack of cigarettes. This perplexes me to no end. "But you don't smoke and are almost out of money, right?" And yes, it turns out I had not misremembered. He wanted to start smoking at that moment in time. Now, this is actually a fairly extraordinary amount of effort. Imagine, you're comfortable in a hospital bed, in a terrible mood, and all the normal pressures that lead to smoking are absent, such as peers to pressure you. But ex nihilo, you now grudgingly swing to your feet, fish out your last bit of money (cigarettes are supremely expensive in Australia, approximately a whopping USD $20 per pack), and march off to try and form a financially crippling addiction. Surely you have enough problems, and don't need to go through the trouble of leveraging your executive function to make more of them? After mulling this over for a while, I come to the realization that this fellow felt the need to inhabit the role of the hard-done-by man on the street. And what does the hard-done-by man do? Well, on the television or a play, he would light up a cigarette of course! Probably take a big, long drag off it, then close his eyes and exhale a stream of smoke into the sky as he sighs. It's real cool, yeah, he's a real cool dude. It's all symbolic, y'see? He's destroying his body as if to say "the world is wearing me down so quickly, the cigarettes won't have time to get me, heh". This is practically understandable, in a strange, catharsis-y way. We all know social scripts exist. There are rough guidelines on how much to tip a waiter in the U.S. In Australia, you should stand on the left side of an escalator if you're not intending to walk up it. What I hadn't really thought about was that some of them are so strong and latent that they can spontaneously cause a person to self-inflict a nicotine addiction. I hadn't even really noticed that I had an archetype of the put-upon smoker in my mind, but there it was, and you likely knew exactly what I was talking about. These scripts are adaptive in some situations — for example, well-adjusted men should be aware that the comradely arm on the shoulder is a great deal more appropriate with a male colleague than a female one, and an even better-adjusted person will just not touch their colleagues. But other scripts, especially the ones that are too small to think about or too large to see, drive insane life decisions. When I was studying psychology, almost everyone, including me, picked the course because we weren't sure what we wanted to do with our lives, but the script says finish high school and then take on ten of thousands of dollars in debt. That script is so large that it basically encompasses your whole upbringing. When you try to look at it, you see grey, and think "there is no elephant here, just a cement wall". Or when someone looks for a job they just start sending CVs out, even though that basically doesn't work at all. The assumption that this is how you get a job is so quiet that people don't even realize they're making a decision. They think the decision is whether you should have a one-page CV or a three-page CV, not whether they should have a CV at all. And again, when you interface with a sufficiently large system, they will have their own scripts, and you will be expected to abide by them. Your counterparty will usually unthinkingly apply them, and if you find someone that is willing to actually look at the situation at hand, treasure them. The other issue with going off-script, or otherwise deviating, is that you have to accept that you're going to look extremely silly if things don't work out. Someone, usually someone that isn't taking any risks themselves, will be a dick about it. Let's say that my company does well enough for me to draw a full tech-tier salary in 2026. I'll be praised for whatever I did differently. Six co-founders! My God, he's a genius! You can keep most of them working contract roles, which means your revenue requirements are low, but it only takes them about an hour a week to mobilize their networks for sales! His mind is a thousandfold blade, so keen is his thinking! Sure, now let's say that it collapses in June because a co-founder wants to pivot to a SaaS offering and I don't. Six co-founders! My God, what a fool! Everyone knows there are reasons that VCs prefer two to three founders and no more! A huge risk for a startup are the founders having a falling-out, and the risk increases exponentially with each node in the fully connected network! His mind is being passed around by stoned college grads, so blunt is his thinking! I can skip the embarrassment by doing what everyone else does. If I failed the normal and boring way, by running a non-Extreme Programming consultancy, with one co-founder, that writes Python because everyone else does, selling GenAI bullshit11, I would be beyond critique. I'd just say "Gosh golly, sales are hard", and everyone would nod sympathetically. Guess what though, whether or not people point and laugh, they certainly aren't going to pay your rent for you. Who gives a fuck about embarrassment? LaRusso: Do you think I stand a chance at the tournament? Miyagi: Not matter what Miyagi think. Miyagi not fighting. What most of this comes down to, fundamentally, is whether you trust your own judgement, what you're willing to stake on it, and whether that conviction is strong enough to throw away the guarantees that you'd get from conforming. Because you could take the guaranteed money for writing the book, and if you don't really believe that your judgement is superior, perhaps the money is worth it. Readers call me with some frequency to ask me if I think their startup idea is good. Could it sell? Would it work? Should I do it? How the hell would I know, I'm just some guy with a blog and a business that may explode in the next year. But if I were the owner of a $100M company, would I really know any better? If anyone knew, then when you asked them they would steal your idea. But no one knows, so the idea is safe and sound, and deep down the asker must be aware of this or they wouldn't be asking. Or take last week, when a student visited me from a local university to ask if they should drop out of university to run a startup. They really didn't like the idea of a corporate job, found university extremely tedious and their peers uninspired, so on, so forth. They were clearly very intelligent, but also clearly very young. What do you say there? Because the knee-jerk impulse, for fear of being irresponsible, is to say the boring thing without thinking about it. Finish your degree first. Get a few years of corporate experience. Or even, I know you're depressed, but don't quit your job without something else lined up. None of that is necessarily bad advice, but we should view ourselves with suspicion when we think about saying them, because they also absolve ourselves of guilt if things go awry. Who could blame us for giving the conservative line, even if you can easily play the tape forward and see it results in damnation? The advice that people are too scared to give, but which they sometimes really believe, with the usual caveats for a mental health event that has crippled the recipient's ability to see clearly: "What does it matter what I think? Do what you think is best for yourself, and yes, you might lose your life savings. What's the alternative, doing what other people say is best for the rest of your life?" Thank you for reading all the way through. For this kindness, I leave you with a parting gift. Penguin, what the fuck is going on over there? PS: Oh yeah, I put this in to justify writing, hire my nerds or whatever. Nassim Taleb calls this the "antilibrary", the collection of books that one owns that one has not yet read. Taleb argues that an antilibrary is there to educate and humble, while a library of already-read books has much of its usefulness shifted to signalling erudition. If you were to point out that the optimal antilibrary strategy is to constantly buy books and never read any, Taleb (and I) would call you a nerd. ↩ It was also a gift. Sorry Ricky, the Red Rising copy you got me alongside this was much better! ↩ It is endlessly entertaining to me that the cover of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book so desperately trying to be edgy, censors the the word fuck, achieving a flaccidity that goes beyond simply deciding not to swear at all. ↩ 100% of startup founders nodding at this. ↩ It is a custom that whenever I or Jordan call our shot and mess up, we call the other person and loudly declare "I was arrogant and wrong", then accept ruthless mockery. ↩ It is remarkable how many companies seem to forget that the ultimate value is arguably Working Software, and while all the subsidiary principles may fall out of Working Software when you shake it very hard, you can't do away with it. Why calculate velocity if you know you aren't shipping, scrumlords? ↩ The scary thing about messing with long-running, almost-mystical practices like testing is that their second-order effects run so deep that I get many benefits that I haven't even noticed, so making these decisions also means I may have thrown away some things I don't understand. It's like becoming convinced that I can leave a candle out of the summoning ritual. ↩ I am slowly realizing that my company is comprised entirely of fucking lunatics, and I am the cracked porcelain mask of sanity that attends sales calls. ↩ Our scathing disdain for this has not prevented us from chanting "event-driven is good for internal system integration" whenever we need to annoy Ash, which is probably not bullying. ↩ We incidentally allow anyone to pair program with us over a four hour session, where you can choose to be amazed at our great team energy, or if you'd prefer laugh at how bad we are at programming, so long as you'd consider writing a nice review if you have fun and see strong evidence of competence.
