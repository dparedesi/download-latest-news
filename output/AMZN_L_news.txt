ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind. The BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, signaling growth, especially in AI and fintech, where financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022. US tech professionals are drawn to companies like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, and Netflix for their innovation, competitive pay, and supportive cultures. These employers offer the chance to work on transformative technologies, grow professionally, and enjoy flexible, inclusive workplaces. Tech workers rank companies like Oracle, Amazon, and FIS Global highly, per Forbes’ 2024 Best Employers for Tech Workers, based on about 25,000 surveyed employees. Oracle’s supportive culture and Amazon’s mentorship programs shine, offering competitive pay, $142,000–$210,000 along with generous bonuses, stock options, and growth. Robert Half’s 2025 Salary Guide notes only 41% of tech workers are satisfied with pay, averaging $112,521, though AI-skilled professionals earn a 17.7% premium. A Dice report highlights 47% of tech workers are actively seeking new roles, driven by underpayment or lack of flexibility. Layoffs make job searches tougher. Still, over 7 million job postings in 2025, a 33% jump, per Dice, show opportunities persist for skilled candidates. AI engineering roles are emerging as the top hiring priority. U.S. tech managers are hiring for AI engineer positions. This surge in AI-focused recruitment is complemented by a growing need for full-stack engineers, who play a crucial role in building AI systems. The most sought-after jobs include AI engineers, cloud architects, and cybersecurity analysts. AI engineers, leveraging Python and TensorFlow, earn $150,000–$300,000 plus bonuses and stock, per Glassdoor. Cloud architects average $148,821, and cybersecurity analysts, vital amid digital threats, earn $120,000–$200,000, according to Robert Half. Work-from-home policies are shrinking. Robert Half finds only 18% of 2025 tech roles are fully remote, clashing with 46% of workers unwilling to return onsite full-time. Hybrid models dominate, with companies offering commute perks to lure workers back, per Crunchbase. This shift frustrates many, as flexibility remains a top priority, per Harvey Nash’s 2024 report. Life as a tech worker is dynamic but demanding. Many juggle upskilling in AI or cloud computing, with 87% of hiring leaders valuing AI experience, per ResumeTemplates.com. Long hours, especially in startups, contrast with perks like mental wellness support at firms like CoreWeave. However, the BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, driven by AI and fintech growth. Financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022, reflecting shifting priorities toward fintech innovation. The tech industry, heavily reliant on global supply chains, faces significant challenges from the 2025 tariffs. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA, which depend on manufacturing in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, are grappling with increased costs for imported hardware, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The Consumer Technology Association projects that tariffs could reduce U.S. consumer purchasing power by $90–143 billion, with potential declines in laptop and tablet purchases by up to 68% and smartphones by 37%. This drop in demand threatens revenue for hardware giants and e-commerce platforms, as seen in stock price drops. Business woman working in an incredible futuristic and original office space, looking at her phone, ... More worried about layoffs The tech industry faced significant workforce reductions, with Layoffs.fyi reporting that 50,728 employees were let go across 111 tech companies. This wave of layoffs, while less intense than the peak of 2023, reflects ongoing adjustments within the sector as companies navigate economic shifts, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. Among the companies leading these layoffs, Intel stands out with its announcement to cut approximately 22,000 jobs, representing 20% of its workforce. This move, the largest tech layoff of the year, underscores the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry. Meta followed with a reduction of 3,600 workers, roughly 5% of its staff, framing the cuts as a push to enhance productivity and eliminate underperforming roles. STMicro, another player in the electronics and semiconductor space, laid off 3,000 employees, grappling with market headwinds. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) trimmed 2,500 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, after a 19% drop in its stock price in the first quarter of 2025. Workday, a software firm, reduced its headcount by 1,750, or 8.5%, to redirect resources toward artificial intelligence initiatives. Microsoft also contributed to the trend, eliminating 2,280 roles across divisions like cloud services and mixed reality as part of performance-driven restructuring. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has reshaped priorities. Firms are channeling significant investments into AI development, automating tasks previously handled by human workers. This shift has rendered roles in areas like software engineering, human resources, and support teams redundant, as evidenced by cuts at Stack Overflow and Salesforce. Despite robust profits at some tech giants, high interest rates, inflation, and investor demands for leaner operations have pushed companies to prioritize cost-cutting. Meta and Microsoft, for instance, have used layoffs to bolster stock prices and strengthen their financial positions. Many firms are restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as AI and cybersecurity, as seen in Cisco’s strategic pivot away from less profitable segments. A concerning dynamic is at play. Once one or two top tier tech companies announce layoffs, it follows up with a copycat effect where companies also start laying off people too.

U.S. stocks were a mixed bag Monday as investors followed earnings across sectors, from pizza to semiconductors and sanitation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 114 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 4 points, or about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 17 points, or 0.1%. All three were up during morning trading before falling throughout the afternoon and finishing close to even. Treasury Secretary Bessent made the rounds on television over the weekend, trying to project optimism that a path forward on tariffs could still emerge, especially regarding trade deals with nations across Asia. His remarks came as the U.S. moves deeper into a 90-day tariff pause — now about 20% complete — and economic damage is already mounting. U.S. farmers warn that the agriculture sector is in a “full-blown crisis,” according to CNBC, with mass cancellations of pork, hay, lumber, and other exports to China driving deep financial losses and layoffs across the industry. Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism hitting its lowest ratio since 2008. Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificialintelligence chip aimed at replacing some high-end Nvidia (NVDA+0.35%) products. The Ascend 910D processor represents a fresh push by China’s tech sector to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia dropped as much as 4% in Monday trading before finishing the day down almost 2.1%. Domino’s Pizza (DPZ+0.67%) missed expectations on revenue but topped earnings forecasts, reporting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner highlighted the company’s ability to “control what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” and boasted about progress under the chain’s “Hungry for MORE” five-year growth initiative. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% for the quarter, while international same-store sales rose 3.7%, excluding currency impacts. Global net store count fell by 8, reflecting 17 net openings in the U.S. and 25 net closures internationally. Domino’s stock finished the day up about 0.6%. Waste Management (WM-0.11%) reports earnings after the bell, with analysts scrutinizing margins and pricing power amid inflationary pressures. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-6.75%) will offer an early glimpse into global chip demand, with a year-over-year earnings drop expected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+5.68%) results could provide insight into how much R&D spending chipmakers are still willing to do in a tighter environment. On the real estate side, Welltower (WELL+1.40%) will test investor appetite for healthcare REITs in a high-rate environment. Roper Technologies (ROP+0.68%) rounds out the day’s lineup, with investors watching for signs of steady growth and M&A potential in the industrial software space. Tuesday brings results from Visa (V+1.21%), Coca-Cola (KO+0.78%), Booking Holdings (BKNG+0.25%), and Novartis (NVS+0.99%). Visa is expected to post about 9% revenue growth to $9.55 billion, fueled by strong payment and cross-border volumes. While earnings are projected to come in slightly ahead of last year, investors will be watching closely for any signs of weakness in the outlook — particularly as new tariffs could weigh on consumer spending and international travel. Later this week, Microsoft (MSFT+0.74%) and Meta (META+0.81%) report after the bell Wednesday, giving investors a read on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital ad trends. Amazon (AMZN-0.15%) and Apple (AAPL+0.52%) are on deck Thursday, while Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A+0.45%) is set to follow on Friday, capping one of the biggest earnings weeks of the year.

Title: The reality of today's tech industry: layoffs, long hours, AI threats, and few perks

In a nutshell: It had long been said that a career in tech was the ultimate dream: high salaries, security, and a huge number of perks made for some very happy workers. But things look quite different today. The tech world has seen the highest number of layoffs of any private sector industry this year; perks have been cut; salaries aren't increasing in line with the extra demands; and there's the constant spectre of AI. As parodied in the brilliant Silicon Valley show, there was a time when some tech employees were paid fortunes to do almost nothing in their jobs. Their enviable situation was still being reported a couple of years ago, when companies were flush with cash and had hired extra workers during the pandemic boom. Now, we're faced with almost weekly headlines about tech's massive job cuts. Intel recently confirmed it is making layoffs that could impact 20,000+ people. Meta has cut 5% of its workforce in performance-based layoffs, something that Microsoft is also doing. Then there's Google, which this year has offered voluntary exit plans for some staff. Overall, more than 50,000 people from 100 tech companies have been laid off in 2025 so far. Google cut back on employee fitness classes in 2023 Beyond the layoffs, more tech-industry perks are disappearing. Working from home is becoming a taboo subject as more firms drag employees back into the office: Intel is increasing its three-day in-office mandate to four days, while Google has told many remote workers to return to physical locations or face termination. The Wall Street Journal notes that good pay is still prevalent among Silicon Valley companies, though AI experts are seeing their wages rise faster than anyone else. But firms have become obsessed with delivering the results that Wall Street analysts expect, and a lot of the revenue they bring in now goes toward AI infrastructure rather than universal wage boosts. Employees are also expected to work longer to stay competitive – Google co-founder Sergey Brin thinks 60 hours per week is the perfect amount for peak productivity. Sergey Brin Another problem is that many firms aren't filling the empty roles despite taking on more customers, with mundane day-to-day functions handed over to AI. The WSJ reports on an Amazon Web Services manager who says that he had to return to writing code for the first time in a decade last year as the team that would normally do it wasn't available. The publication reports on a Meta recruiter who was laid off by the social media giant and rehired as a "short-term employee." It means she doesn't get any pay increases, promotions, or stock, and she's responsible for a workload that used to be spread out among several people. Productivity, streamlining, efficiency, and cost cutting are becoming the mantras for tech companies, which some say is being spurred by President Trump and Elon Musk's budget slashing and purging of government agencies. The industry's amazing perks like almost-unlimited amount of leave, free merchandise and, in the case of Meta, free laundry and dry cleaning have gone. Even high-quality food and drink in the cafes is disappearing as companies look to save money at every turn. Will things improve? As the economy starts to look shakier amid the Trump tariffs and the AI obsession shows no signs of slowing down, it's unlikely that the tech world will return to the shining light it once was anytime soon.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change The Week That Was: 2025 04-26 (April 26, 2025)Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org)The Science and Environmental Policy Project Quote of the Week: “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.” — James Madison (1788) Number of the Week: Increase of 11ºF by 2100. THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a discussion of the National Science Foundation. TWTW continues with a brief discussion of the scientific method and why the US National Climate Assessment does not meet the standards needed for its work to be considered physical science. TWTW considers the high scientific integrity of Roger Pielke, Jr. before criticizing his view that fixing the National Climate Assessment will be easy. TWTW then questions the actual physical science supporting EPA’s Endangerment Finding. It concludes with presenting three interesting articles on diverse subjects. ********************* NSF: The Nation Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports science and engineering in the US. Its counterpart in the medical fields is the National Institute of Health. The NSF’s enacted budget for fiscal year 2024 is $9.06 Billion. The requested 2025 budget is slightly over $10 billion. According to reports, the current request will be cut, and part of its workforce will be cut. On April 24, NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan announced that he has resigned. News reports claimed this is proof of the anti-science bias of the current administration. The April 12 TWTW discussed a significant problem in US science funding. The U.S. Global Change Research Program publishes what is considered the nation’s premier report on climate change, the National Climate Assessment (NCA), produced by the consulting firm ICF International. The report is endorsed by 15 government agencies including the National Science Foundation. However, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (2023) is a blatantly political report that omits physical evidence that contradicts its general conclusions that the current warming is unprecedented. Further it contains no physical evidence showing the relationship between increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and increasing temperatures. Yet, it uses the discredited very high emissions scenario to forecast a temperature increase of 11ºF by 2100. The Fifth National Climate Assessment is not physical science but more a follow-up piece on the highly politicized Sixth Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly its Synthesis Report (March 2023). The Synthesis Report contains none of the uncertainty expressed in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis (2021). The US National Climate Assessment should emphasize the uncertainty, not omit it. And the National Science Foundations should not be a party to such a poor report. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy, and Science, Policy, and Evidence. *************** Zero Omissions: Although its origins are far earlier, the scientific method became established during the controversy on an Earth-centered universe or a planetary system with the visible planets orbiting the sun. The great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) insisted that only careful observation over long periods of time can resolve the controversy. In 1572, Brahe observed a new bright star (probably a super nova) that triggered doubt in the old Aristotelian belief that the universe was fixed. Brahe developed a research program with improving the instruments used to observe the planets to determine the paths. After his death his assistant, Johannes Kepler used Brahe’s data to explain that the planetary orbits were not circular but formed an ellipse with the sun as one focus and to develop Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion. This history establishes an important principle in the scientific method; no observations should be omitted. As discussed above, in the reports of the IPCC, particularly the summaries, and in the National Climate Assessment (NCA), important observations are omitted. For example, for 99.9% of Earth’s history, there was no correlation between CO2 and temperature. For the last few glacial periods, CO2 changes have come after temperature changes. Two decades of data collected for measuring the earth’s energy balance reveal that the increase in absorbed heat is primarily due to changes in the earth’s albedo. Thus, these reports are not physical science. They do not use the scientific method. Some defenders of this practice in climate “science” avoid the issue by claiming that their work is based on “first principles” or fundamental concepts or assumptions, sometimes considered self-evident. Alas, first principles tell us about the patterns of spectra of molecules such as CO2 but cannot tell us precise energy levels. Nor can first principles tell us about the probability of absorbing IR of a certain wavelength. In Quantum Mechanics, first principles can tell us about the spacings of energy levels, but not their amounts. Precise measurements are required. Such issues are omitted in the NCA. Those who argue from the standpoint of first principles are in the realm of metaphysics, thinking about physics, not in the realm of physical physics. In his 1912 book Problems of Philosophy, the logician Betrand Russell has several chapters evaluating the work of Immanuel Kant questioning “Is a priori knowledge possible?” Can we know something by pure logic alone, without experience or observations? This is a philosophical question, not one for physical science based on observations. *************** Misguided Defense of NCA: Roger Pielke, Jr., is a scientist with considerable integrity. He wrote an essay published by the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology titled “Do Not Use the ICAT Hurricane Loss ‘Dataset’: An Opportunity for Course Correction in Climate Science.” Yet Pielke helped develop this dataset. The abstract states: “A fatally flawed time series of U.S. hurricane losses assembled by an insurance company almost a decade ago has found its way into analyses published in the peer-reviewed literature. The flawed time series is based on undocumented modifications to a research-quality dataset that I and my colleagues [sic.] published almost two decades ago. The uncritical use of the time series has led to erroneous conclusions published in the peer-reviewed literature which then were repeated in important climate science assessments. This paper explains the origin of the flawed dataset and demonstrates its many biases. The errors are so obvious and consequential that papers published in the peer-reviewed literature that rely on the flawed dataset should be retracted. While mistakes happen in science, what matters more is what we in the community do when mistakes are discovered.” Recognizing his considerable integrity, TWTW takes issue with Pielke’s defense of the National Climate Assessment. In a post “Trump Comes for Climate Research: Making sense of the USGCRP and NCA” Pielke writes: “To fix the NCA would not be difficult. Three actions are needed. First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. Second, the report should be led and written by experts chosen by an empaneling team. This team should be selected by a bipartisan group, as is typically done for reports on highly politicized issues. For instance, the majority and minority members of the House Science Committee could each select 6 members of this empaneling committee, with two co-chairs. The empaneling committee would then identify experts to lead and contribute to the report. Third, before the writing starts, the assessment team should query decision makers — federal, state, local, in business and civil society — to identify what information they perceive to be most useful to their decisions related to climate mitigation and adaptation. These three steps would ensure that there is no perception of White House influence on the report, that it is authored by experts assembled in a bipartisan manner and that the topics that the report focuses have direct relevance to decision makers. The NCA is far too important to be politicized, and politicization is a choice. The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and OMG [sic. OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. I do not expect the Trump Administration to take this (very good) advice.” To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. Omission of physical evidence has been a problem for years with the IPCC and the NCA, and with each iteration the problem has been getting worse. The IPCC reports on which the NCA is based have been politicized since “Climate Change 1992: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment” which Frederick Seitz asserted was the worst abuse of the peer review process he had witnessed in sixty years of American science. The National Climate Assessment is no better. The problem of omission of physical evidence is deeply ingrained, and a generation of scientists have been conditioned to accept it. The reports have become more metaphysics (thinking of physics) and propaganda than physical science. The issue is not trust in “the science” or politicalized scientists, the issue is adherence to the scientific method, a process. If physical evidence is omitted, the work is no longer physical science. Further, Pielke suggests cutting out the White House. The president is elected by the whole people, is accountable to them, and represents their interests. None of the other members of the panel he proposes are elected or accountable to all the people. There is no doubt that the influence of the White House in the past has not conformed to the principles of physical science, but then neither by and large has the pool of “experts” from which the other panel members would presumably be drawn. The only solution is to hold everyone to the principles of science and that can be done only by transparency and freedom of public comment. See links under Seeking a Common Ground. *************** Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding? The National Climate Assessment is claimed to support the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. The EPA’s press release on February 27 states [Boldface in original]: “Action On December 7, 2009, the Administrator signed two distinct findings regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act: These findings do not themselves impose any requirements on industry or other entities. However, this action was a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and other sectors.” An article in the British medical publication, the Lancet, states: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations”. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? (Note that the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapor, is not mentioned.) The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science. Small corrections are not sufficient. It is wrong. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. *************** Radiation Transfer: In developing a method for estimating the greenhouse effect in today’s atmosphere, William Van Wijngaarden and William Happer use the work of physicist Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916). TWTW came across a 1906 essay by Schwarzschild. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Problems In World Economic Forum? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with: “World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab is under investigation by the organization he created after a new whistleblower letter alleged financial and ethical misconduct by the longtime leader and his wife. The anonymous letter was sent last week to the Forum’s board and raised concerns about the Forum’s governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the Forum’s resources without proper oversight, according to the letter and people familiar with the matter. It included allegations that Klaus Schwab asked junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used Forum funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels. It also alleged that his wife Hilde, a former Forum employee, scheduled “token” Forum-funded meetings in order to justify luxury holiday travel at the organization’s expense. Klaus Schwab in recent days argued against an investigation, telling board members that he denied the unsubstantiated allegations and that he would challenge them in a lawsuit, the people said. The board of trustees decided to open a probe during an emergency meeting on Easter Sunday. Schwab opted to resign immediately as the chairman, instead of staying on for an extended transition period as previously planned.” See Article # 1. *************** Wind Power, Maybe? An article in the Wall Street Journal begins with (correction by TWTW): “Germany has invested so many hundreds of billions of euros in its green energy transition over the years that no one can tally the precise amount. Yet the share of wind and solar power in the country’s energy mix in the first quarter of this year managed to fall—by a lot. There’s a lesson for the U.S. here. Renewable sources made up some 47% of electricity consumption in Europe’s largest economy in the first three months of 2024 2025 the energy trade association BDEW reported Thursday. That’s down from 56% in the first three months of 2024. The drop comes despite Germany’s continuing build-out of renewable generation. The country has added 872 wind turbines with a capacity of 4.3 gigawatts since April 2024, yet wind-power output fell 16%. Ouch. You can guess what went wrong. February and March were unusually wind-free, onshore and offshore. A lack of rain meant hydropower underperformed. March was sunnier than usual, which helped to boost solar-electricity output compared to a year earlier. But we’re talking about Germany in March. Relatively short daylight hours in a northern latitude meant this boost wasn’t enough to offset the decline in wind generation. These climactic conditions happen regularly enough that the German language has a word for it: Dunkelflaute, or ‘dark stillness.’ It means renewables alone can’t power an advanced industrial economy, as even Berlin is starting to notice.” Germany is further down the road of free energy from wind and solar than the US. Yet, many US politicians cling to the belief that wind and solar can power a modern economy, especially high-tech that requires reliable electricity. See Article # 2. *************** SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Defensive Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. *************** Increase of 11ºF by 2100. As stated above, the Fifth US National Climate Assessment asserts that under the high emissions scenario, by 2100 temperatures will be 11ºF (6ºC) warmer than today.

The 2°C (3.6℉) limit is a best estimate of the maximum temperature rise beyond which the effects of global warming are unpredictable. It is a judgement call. The IPCC’s 1.5°C (2.7℉) goal was exceeded for the first time in 2024.

The crucial line that doesn’t matter By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 For years we were hectored that holding the world to the Paris Agreement limit of 1.5°C of warming from “pre-industrial times”, a term alarmists use to mean “75 years after the industrial revolution” started not “before there was industry”, was critically crucial in its vital importance. But alas their rhetoric was unpersuasive, their plans were unsound or both, and they admit 1.5 is “out of reach.” So now we’re told that while it was essential it didn’t really matter whereas 2.0°C is like this time for sure man unless it’s not.

Starmer’s Surrender To Brussels Will Force Up Energy Bills By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Apr 17, 2025 But much more seriously we would lose all control over what happens to the carbon price in future.

[SEPP Comment: The hurricane season may have been costly for the Southeast and Florida, but not one of the most devastating ones in terms of wind speed.

By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 23, 2025 The second key point is that tropical cyclone landfalls exhibit high variability. And as everybody knows who cares to, the greater the variability, the harder it is to separate noise from signal and the longer the time series you need to develop even medium confidence about a trend. Finally, the notion that major storms are surging proving a crisis and so forth is undermined by the fact that the trend for “Accumulated Cyclonic Energy” or total destructive horribleness of all storms in a year combined seems to be “flat as a pancake”. Here we go again, windstorm edition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Apr 16, 2025 Supposedly it’s spring, despite various local headlines of the “Arctic air will spill into Ontario with possible 15-25 cm of April snow” variety. And with the seasonal upsurge in wind comes the seasonal upsurge in claims that windstorms are proof of man-made climate hysteria. For instance Matthew Wielicki notes that “It’s Tornado Season Again, Again, Again… So can the dreaded CO2 add causing American tornadoes to become less destructive to its list of blessings? Well, no. Statistics are sharp on both edges and the fact that the United States has gone 11 years without a single EF6 event may be a blessing but it’s not a trend.

While the world as a whole was unusually warm during the war years on average, Europe, northern Siberia, and the central North Pacific suffered through three bitterly cold winters from late 1939 to 1942. The Southern Hemisphere was not spared, sea surface temperatures in the southern mid-latitudes were unusually cool and Australia suffered from a very prolonged drought from 1937 to 1945 (Hegerl, Brönnimann, Schurer, & Cowan, 2018).

Not surprisingly, even though there is a wild price spike, farmers in Ghana are leaving the industry, smuggling crops out (because they get a better price). They didn’t plant new trees, they ran out of money for fertilizer, and didn’t try new varieties. Their children don’t want to farm cocoa, and the yields are falling on old sickly plantations.

When the Wind Didn’t Blow in Germany A years-long renewables push leaves the economy hostage to the weather. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, April 25, 2025 Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe A. van Wijngaarden and W. Happer – Using simple thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that the atmosphere of a planet with suﬃciently high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Well, gee. An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection. Maybe the authors live in an alternate universe. Clueless – they are probably delusional enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to the atmosphere makes it hotter. Have people stopped thinking for themselves? Or does this sort of nonsense only occur in the USA? Nobody who contributes to WUWT, not even Michael Flynn, could possibly check the veracity of all the issues raised by this enormously convoluted and over-referenced post. What the hell is it about? I don’t understand the purpose of hosting it. Yours sincerely, Dr Bill Johnston, http://www.bomwatch.com.au ‘An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection.’ Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Please provide a citation from a competent source that explains how such an atmosphere will convect given that it can’t dump heat to space. It would convect in the instance of a surface temperature that varied from one place to another due to day/night, for one thing, latitude, surface slope for more, and so forth. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. The good news is that qualified academics like you and vW&H can differ re. these type of questions, meaning ‘The Science’ really isn’t settled to the point that we should be recklessly messing around with how we obtain energy. I guess the follow-up questions would be to what extent would it convect and why wouldn’t the bulk of the atmosphere effectively become isothermal after some interval of time. Don’t guess. Look at Richard Feynman’s lectures, where he says “It is not an isothermal atmosphere”, and how he comes to that conclusion. Observation supports the non-isothermal nature of the atmosphere. As to “what extent”, what has that to do with anything? Are you trying to resile from your previous blanket statements? None of this nonsense is going to back up any silly idea that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! Let’s consider an atmosphere of O2 and N2 only that allows thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface to pass directly to space. Lets’s stick to reality, if you don’t object too much. Both O2 and N2 emit and absorb infrared. Prof John Tyndall established this by experiment more than 150 years ago, and compared the absorption qualities of CO2 and H2O (for example) to dry air, purged of CO2. You can’t show me an experiment that demonstrates that your fantasy represents reality in any way. Next you’ll be telling me that adding CO2 to air makes it hotter! ‘Lets’s stick to reality..’ Yes, let’s – show me a bona fide citation that O2 and N2 absorb and emit IR, i..e., show me their emission spectrums if you have any idea what those are. Otherwise, stop being an obnoxious troll who continuously spews nonsense to the delight of climate alarmists. Frank, you probably won’t accept Penn State as “bona fide”, but here’s something from Penn State – While all matter emits radiation at all wavelengths, it does not do so equally. This is where the next radiation law comes in. Wein’s Law states that the wavelength of peak emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting object. So I’ll wait for you to find some matter which does not emit or absorb infrared radiation. I won’t hold my breath waiting. It looks like you overlooked the words “troposphere” and “tropopause” in you criticism of van Wijngaarden and Happer. The Earth’s stratosphere does not have any significant convection, thus falsifying your assertion that “An atmosphere of any gases will demonstrate convection”. Significant atmospheric convection is precluded when an atmosphere develops warmer layers above cooler layers, which can even occur temporarily in Earth’s troposphere under the weather phenomenon known as a “temperature inversion” Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . From the paper – must develop a convecting troposphere between the surface and the tropopause altitude. Surface to tropopause. You wrote – Now, you were saying something about clueless . . . You are agreeing with me at this point? You have not managed to “falsify” anything I said. An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection. You may play all the silly semantic games you wish, but the presence of “greenhouse gases” is not necessary for convection to occur. Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware. You might read your attachment – “suppresses convection” presupposes convection in the first place. Do you not agree? Or maybe you are claiming that inversions cannot occur without the presence of “greenhouse gases? Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter! “You are agreeing with me at this point? “ No, isn’t that obvious? “An atmosphere of any gas will demonstrate convection.” (repeated claim, to be sure!) No, but I’ll make the falsification of that statement even more obvious . . . see attachment. “Inversions occur under a few different conditions, none of which have anything to do with so-called “greenhouse gases”, as far as I as I am aware.” Humidity plays a significant role in the formation and characteristics of temperature inversions. While inversions are primarily defined by temperature differences between layers, humidity levels can influence the strength and persistence of inversions, particularly near the surface. (Hint for you: humidity is a measure of the average amount of water vapor content in a given parcel of air, and water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) “Hopefully, you are not clueless enough to believe that adding “greenhouse gases” to air makes it hotter!” Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. As I sad, greenhouse gases have nothing to do with inversions. CO2 is denser than air, H2O is less dense. You burble that – water vapor is the strongest of all greenhouse gases currently present in Earth’s atmosphere.) Strongest? Strength compared to what, precisely? You are on the right track when you say – Adding “greenhouse gases” to a mixture of N2, O2 and Ar gases makes that mixture more capable of both absorbing and emitting LWIR radiation . . . whether or not the resulting mixture becomes “hotter” or “colder” depends on many other independent factors. Indeed. Adding so-called greenhouse gases has no quantifiable effect on temperature. By the way, your AI quote happens to mention that the Moon’s atmosphere lacks the characteristics of a “conventional dense atmosphere” – no mention of lighter H2O, or heavier CO2. Strange, that. Taking all that into account, tell what you think this mythical “greenhouse effect” is supposed to do? “It all depends”? Not much use at all, in that case. “Why Has the Daily Sceptic Been Put on Tortoise Media’s Climate Naughty List?” You do realise what Tortoise media is? James Harding is a co-founder of the slow one, and was…. Director of BBC News and was in the post from August 2013 until January 2018. “James Harding’s slow news outlet Tortoise Media reported a loss of £3.8 million for 2023, down a bit from a loss of £4.6 million the year before. It looks like things might be getting worse… Analysis of internet traffic on SimilarWeb shows a massive drop in Tortoise readership from 465,560 in January to 242,328 in March.

Given that the Daily Sceptic is not on message…. it’s on the naughty step. O/T On Thursday this week many local authorities and Mayors are up for election. Needless to say, the car crash known as the Labour party is expected to do rather badly.. Doncaster – Miliband country “Labour’s never been for the working class – they’ve swapped. They’re not the party they were, and that’s why I like Reform. They’re the common-sense party, exactly what we want.” … “I wrote to Ed Miliband and told him about the fuel allowance.” “I got a letter off him, and he said that pensioners have never been as well off. I ripped the letter up, and said I would never vote Labour again.” … “I feel very disappointed in the Labour government,” [she says]. “I thought I’d give Labour a chance again, only to be bitterly disappointed.” “I think that for pensioners and the disabled, [Labour] are really doing a disservice to working class people who have contributed a lot to this country over the years. My trust in them has gone.” Would she contemplate voting Reform as a result? “I think Nigel Farage has some good points: what you see is what you get,” she says, admitting that “Reform or the Conservatives are a better bet for me than Labour at the moment.” https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/27/the-labour-stronghold-that-could-fall-to-reform/ One headline caught my eye…. “Labour Peer Predicts Party Will ‘Get its Head Kicked In’ by Farage over Failure to Address Working Class Concerns”https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/04/27/labour-peer-predicts-party-will-get-its-head-kicked-in-by-farages-reform/ His choice of language makes his feelings on the matter quite clear. It’s thuggish street fighting talk. Football fans even put it into song for the opposition. “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Head Kicked In”, sometimes pluralised to “You’re Gonna Get Your F[n]ucking Heads Kicked In”, is a football chant originating in England. It is also used, apparently, as a case study in psychology and sociology. He could have said we will get trounced, lose badly etc etc etc. The inference is obvious, low class thugs vote Reform. To TWTW, Pielke’s recommendations ignore the most fundamental problem: the omission of physical evidence that contradicts the general conclusions. “To me” that’s a bit unfair to Roger. The copy of the “Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity” … which came with the recommendation that “federal agencies should adopt this definition, incorporate it into their scientific integrity policy, and communicate it to their workforce” … that I came across was for the HHS “federal agency” (direct link) : HHS adopts the following Official Federal Definition of Scientific Integrity: Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. Scientific integrity is the adherence to professional practices, ethical behavior, and the principles of honesty and objectivity when conducting, managing, using the results of, and communicating about science and scientific activities. Inclusivity, transparency, and protection from inappropriate influence are hallmarks of scientific integrity. I think that “the omission of physical evidence” is therefore covered when Roger wrote : The only addition I’d make today is to explicitly recognize that any NCA should follow the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and [OMB] and agency guidelines for scientific integrity and information quality. . Any “Real Scientist” (TM) who sees the words “honesty” and “scientific integrity” will also be reminded of Richard Feynman’s public lecture about “cargo-cult science”, which includes : There is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science, it’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked — to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.

Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. not only what you think is right about it; other causes that could possibly explain your results; Unfortunately, GHE believers are not scientists, as Richard Feynman describes science. Fanatical cultists would seem to be a more appropriate description. They have some bizarre notion that thermometers becoming hotter is not due to increased man-made heat, but rather the outputs of the combustion of hydrocarbons, namely CO2 and H2O. No amount of either, added to air, will make it hotter. Unbelievable gullibility, except that it is widely believed by people who are well educated and highly qualified. It just goes to show that intelligence is no protection against self deception. Roger Pielke did get this one wrong: First, the assessment should be housed within and implemented entirely from a federal agency within the scope of the USGCRP. There should be no oversight or control exerted from the White House. ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House. ‘ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.’ You need to add provisos to the effect that this statement only holds if the Executive Branch is headed by a Democrat, and that if this condition is not met, oversight and control of these agencies will pass to the Democrat National Committee and/or such assignees as they may name. You need to add provisos . . . Why is that? “ALL federal agencies are part of the executive branch and subject to oversight and control from the White House.” Not true according to Google’s AI bot which outputs the following: “There are federal agencies that operate independently from the Executive Branch, primarily those classified as independent regulatory agencies and some independent agencies within the executive branch. These agencies are not subject to direct presidential control, although they do maintain some form of relationship with the executive branch. “Here’s a more detailed explanation: Independent Regulatory Agencies: These agencies, like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are established by Congress and have the power to make regulations and enforce laws, often without direct presidential oversight. Independent Agencies within the Executive Branch: Examples include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which operate with a degree of independence from the direct control of the President.” {my bold emphasis added} From the Fifth Climate Assessment Report: Somehow, I remain “skeptical,” if by skeptical, I mean gagging on propaganda. The findings in this report are based on a comprehensive review and assessment of information sources determined to meet the standards and documentation required under the Information Quality Act and the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (App. 2), including peer-reviewed literature, other literature, Indigenous Knowledge, other expert and local knowledge, and climate data processed and prepared for authors by NOAA’s Technical Support Unit (TSU; see Guide to the Report section below and App. 3). NCA5 was thoroughly reviewed by Federal Government experts, external experts, and the public multiple times throughout the report development process. An expert external review was performed by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.3 Additional information on the development of this Assessment can be found in Appendix 1: Assessment Development Process. The great genius of the founding fathers was that they didn’t set up one government, they created the federal government as essentially three governments. Each with its own powers. The three branches were set up in opposition to the others, such that no branch could do anything on its own. They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government. To our regret, later generations decided that efficiency was more important, so they tore down many of the walls the founders had set up. As a result, we now have the Beast of Columbia, that rules over all of us with an iron fist. ‘They also set up the state governments to be in opposition to the federal government.’ Not true. The original idea was that the people of the sovereign states agreed per ratification of the Constitution to set up a limited federal government. Unfortunately the latter has been highly successful in re-defining ‘limited’ over time, although I think some people are starting to wake up. Under the above article’s subheading of Science Supporting the Endangerment Finding?, the British medical publication the Lancet is quoted as stating: “In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed the science-rooted Endangerment Finding, stating that greenhouse gases ‘threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations’. This finding became the cornerstone of most US climate policies and influenced many others globally.” “Science-rooted Endangerment Finding” . . . who are they (both the EPA and the Lancet) kidding? Also, underneath this quote are these statements from the article’s TWTW author(s): “Carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis, which provides the food for all complex plant life and all animal life on Earth. Where is the physical evidence that it threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations? . . .The Endangerment Finding has no basis in physical science.” Some hard facts to go along with that: Given the current (2025) concentration of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is only at around 425 ppm, the Lancet, with its asserted focus on human health, should have noted the following regarding ACCEPTABLE levels of CO2 in air that humans breath over very long time periods: — in general indoor environments (homes/bedrooms, offices, theaters, auditoriums . . . all without overcrowding), the typical CO2 level can be up to 800 ppm CO2 — in school classrooms, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) recommends that CO2 levels not exceed 1000 ppm — The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that industry workers have an allowable 8-hour time-weighted-average of breathing air not to exceed 5,000 ppm CO2 concentration, and going further stating a “short term” exposure limit in breathing air at 30,000 ppm CO2 is acceptable (note: these are specialized work environments, such as work in confined spaces or near CO2-emitting equipment where such high concentrations may be present) — US Navy submarines routinely operate with allowable concentrations in the their breathable air having up to 11,000 ppm CO2; their maximum, non-emergency upper limit for CO2 concentration is 30,000 ppm (3%); the Navy conducted numerous studies in the 1960’s–1970’s and found that two weeks of continuous breathing of air with CO2 concentrations at 40,000 ppm did not affect performance on multiple tests of cognitive function in physically fit young men — Aboard the International Space Station, the minimum CO2 concentration in the ambient, breathable air is approximately 3,000 ppm, but can reach values greater than 6,500 ppm. The mean concentration is not reduced below 3,000 ppm due to the stations’s limited supply of electrical energy and the capacity of its “air scrubbing” equipment to do such. In addition to the above, when just sitting around humans exhale air having a CO2 concentration in the range of 4–5%, that’s 40,000–50,000 ppm! Yet the EPA Endangement Finding declares CO2 at a value of 850 ppm (the measured atmospheric level back in 2009) threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations??? Obviously, there was no science whatsoever supporting the EPA’s “Finding”. A “bipartisan” commission to repair the NCA, per Roger Pielkie Jr., will probably fix nothing. I point to the example of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (or Simpson–Bowles). Did that do any good?

Even before those 50,000 layoffs in 2025, Silicon Valley's Mercury News was citing some interesting statistics from economic research/consulting firm Beacon Economics. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, the San Francisco Bay Area added 74,700 tech jobs But then in 2023 and 2024 the industry had slashed even more tech jobs -- 80,200 -- for a net loss (over five years) of 5,500. So is there really a cutback in perks and a fear of layoffs that's casting a pall over the industry? share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. Do you agree with the picture that's being painted by the Wall Street Journal? They told their readers that tech workers are now "just like the rest of us: miserable at work."

Today, however, the region is home to several startups that have reached billion-dollar valuations. Some of these startups, propelled into the spotlight by cross-border expansion, are now recognized beyond their home countries, with Nubank notably going public in the U.S. Yet, there is a broader cohort of Latin American scale-ups that deserve attention; many in fintech, but not exclusively. Other important sectors include e-commerce, health tech, logistics, proptech, and SaaS. Some homegrown unicorns may currently hold “paper valuations” from rounds that were raised during the 2021 peak, but the point still stands: They are worth knowing, and many could recover alongside the market, as VC investment in Latin America demonstrated resilience in 2024. As a group, these unicorns also reflect Latin America’s multiple startup hubs. While Brazil and Mexico remain leaders in numbers, unicorns have also emerged from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, further strengthening these ecosystems. Let’s take a closer look at the top Latin American unicorns by valuation — although the oldest price tags often need to be taken with a grain of salt. Coming out of Colombia, Rappi is an on-demand delivery platform that became a super app and expanded into multiple countries. Its rise solidified before the pandemic: In 2019, it raised a $1 billion investment from SoftBank. But its $5.25 billion valuation was attached to the round of more than $500 million it secured in July 2021. Since then, Rappi has operated in a more challenging environment, conducting multiple rounds of layoffs and facing changing gig economy legislation in Mexico, where it now plans to invest $110 million to boost its operations. However, the company still very much hopes to IPO and hired a CFO to prepare for that endeavor after reaching break-even for the first time in late 2023. QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company focused on the rental and sale of residential real estate. With commercial activities in six Latin American countries and a tech hub in Europe, it made several acquisitions and grew into a group with a headcount of more than 3,500 people. In 2021, the startup was busy on the fundraising front: Less than three months after announcing a $300 million Series E at a $4 billion valuation, QuintoAndar raised an additional $120 million at a $5.1 billion valuation. With $755 million raised to date, its cap table includes Kaszek, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Tencent. Creditas is a Brazilian fintech player specializing in loans, including consumer credit. Its latest round of funding was a $260 million Series F in January 2022 valuing the Brazilian lender at $4.8 billion, up from $1.75 billion in December 2020. The Series F was led by Fidelity, with participation from new and existing backers, including Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors, and SoftBank. It was extended in July 2022 at the same valuation, allowing Creditas to buy the Brazilian license of Andorran bank Andbank for some $93 million. Branded as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking markets, Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce platform designed for SMEs and entrepreneurs to sell products and services online — or in short, “Latin America’s answer to Shopify.” Its latest known valuation of $3.1 billion comes from the $500 million Series E mega-round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management that it raised in August 2021, only a few months after its Accel-led $90 million Series D. Wildlife Studios is a Brazilian mobile gaming company. It was co-founded by Victor Lazarte, now also a general partner at Benchmark, the VC firm that led Wildlife Studios’ $60 million Series A in 2019 at a $1.3 billion valuation. Less than a year later, the startup reached a nearly $3 billion valuation from its Series B round. In a candid conversation onstage at Slush 2023, Lazarte said that, in retrospect, raising too much capital at too high a valuation so fast was a “mistake.” In June 2023, the company announced that former Amazon executive Peter Hill would replace Lazarte as CEO. It also conducted several rounds of layoffs. Loft is a Brazilian proptech company supported by big Silicon Valley names since its genesis in 2018. Loft’s $175 million Series C was co-led by a16z and Vulcan Capital in 2020. A $425 million Series D led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners followed in March 2021, and its extension in April 2021 valued the company at $2.9 billion. The digital real estate platform wasn’t immune to the market turn. It conducted two rounds of layoffs in 2022 but denied having raised a down round in November 2022. In 2023, after fresh funding from a sovereign fund in the Middle East” at an undisclosed valuation and another round of layoffs, it claimed to have reached break-even. Unico is a Brazilian ID tech startup, and one of Latin America’s largest SaaS companies. Its $2.6 billion valuation is more recent than many on this list. It came from the $100 million Series D the company raised in April 2022. The round was led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from existing investors General Atlantic and SoftBank Latin America Fund. C6 Bank is a Brazilian digital bank. Unlike some competitors, it hasn’t expanded beyond Brazil, where it has more than 35 million clients. C6 was valued at $2.28 billion in December 2020, six months before JPMorgan Chase acquired 40% ownership of the neobank in 2021. After increasing its stake in 2023, it now owns 46% of C6, which had its first-ever profitable year in 2024. With backers including General Catalyst and SoftBank, Kavak is a Mexico-based e-commerce platform to buy and sell used cars online. Once valued at $8.7 billion after a Series E round that doubled its valuation in 2021, Kavak saw its valuation slashed by $6.5 billion following expansion difficulties and layoffs. After raising a $127 million equity round and securing two $200 million debt facilities in March 2025, the company aims to position itself for a potential IPO within the next three to five years. Bitso is a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that also facilitates cross-border payments. In May 2021, it secured a $250 million Series C round valuing the company at $2.2 billion and co-led by Tiger Global and Coatue, with participation from new and existing investors, including Kaszek and QED. Known for its InfinitePay and Jim.com brands, CloudWalk is a Brazilian payment infrastructure company (not to be confused with the Chinese facial-recognition software company by the same name). CloudWalk’s $2.15 billion valuation resulted from a $150 million Series C led by Coatue in November 2021. Since then, CloudWalk achieved its first full year of profitability in 2023 and closed 2024 with $497 million in revenue. Briefly known as BlitzPay and founded by former PayPal employees, Clip is the Square of Latin America, with POS devices and fintech solutions for businesses. Clip became a unicorn in 2021 following a $250 million round led by SoftBank and Viking, and maintained this status since then. The $100 million round it raised in June 2024 confirmed its $2 billion valuation as the company was “on the brink of profitability,” its CEO told Bloomberg. Loggi is a Brazil-based logistics company known for its focus on last-mile delivery. Its backers include Monashees, Qualcomm Ventures, and SoftBank. Its latest funding round was a $205 million Series F led by CapSur Capital in March 2021 at a valuation close to $2 billion. Bets are still open on who may join the list and how the rankings might be reordered, so we’ll make sure to keep it updated. Topics Freelance Reporter Anna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant.

The devices also have access to Google's Gemini suite as well. At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance. Razr Ultra: Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera.

The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, similar to the Razr Plus 2024. It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99. Razr 2025: As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky. The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7400X, a notch higher than its predecessor. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor. The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. Along with its clamshells, the company also launched the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer. Read more here Alphabet, Google's parent company, released its Q1 earnings on Thursday (April 24), and it was reported that the company's revenue saw a 12% hike year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed later that evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion. Google's core businesses, including Search, YouTube advertising, and AI, were sizable contributors to this overall growth. "We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai Google's Search also saw a gain of $50.7 billion in revenue, YouTube's advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company, and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion. And Google Cloud also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. During the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products, specifically AI Overviews. Read more here Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for Meta’s Quest VR headsets. In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said. These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added. Employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, were among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well. They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged." Read more here A new rumor suggests that Samsung could be taking its mid-year Unpacked event to New York. According to a Korean news site, The JoongAng Daily, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with its new set of foldables, Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July. NYC could allegedly be playing host after three long years. The last time an Unpacked event was held in the location was back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. An industry insider familiar with Samsung's plan told the publication that, "This time, it will be held again in New York, the most representative cultural city, after three years." There is speculation that the Korean OEM could be switching things up to prioritize the U.S. market. Read more here Earlier this week, Google rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support. The latest update didn't bring any significant changes, as Google is gearing up to launch the stable version of its OS this summer. Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, which fixes two bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. It fixes a weird battery drain, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also tends to certain system stability issues and random launcher crashes that some folks were dealing with. However, a few Pixel users have taken to Reddit to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week. Meanwhile, here are some other stories that are worth catching up on: Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

Title: Special Report: We Are Being Warned That There Will Be Empty Shelves Throughout The U.S. “Starting In A Couple Of Weeks”

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Experts are telling us that the supply chain disruptions that we are facing are likely to be more severe than anything that we witnessed during the last pandemic. Anyone that believes that we can easily replace 438 billion dollars of imports from China is just being delusional. There are thousands of products that are made in China that are simply not made anywhere else. Yes, we will do what we can to mitigate the damage, but there is only so much that we can do. I just heard from one business owner that has already received numerous price increase notifications from his suppliers. And apparently there are already hundreds of products on Amazon that have had their prices raised substantially… Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys. In many other cases, products that are manufactured in China will no longer be coming to the United States at all. In fact, President Trump is even admitting that most Chinese businesses “won’t do any business here” as long as tariff rates remain this high… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that no one thinks the current status quo with China is sustainable. The president was asked by Time if he agrees with that sentiment. “Oh I agree,” Mr. Trump responded. He said China “won’t do any business here, because at 145%, it’s going to be very rare that you see business.” Nobody can deny that President Trump is quite correct about this, and the numbers that we are already seeing are quite staggering. For example, it is being reported that the “volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%”… US businesses began scaling back or canceling orders as President Trump ratcheted up the trade war with Beijing after returning to the White House. The volume of goods shipped from China that is scheduled to arrive at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach between the week of May 4 and May 10 has dropped 43%, compared to the same period last year, according to container-tracking software provider Vizion. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Container bookings for shipments from China to the United States dropped by a staggering 64 percent during the first week of April compared to the previous week… The drop in predicted arrivals at Los Angeles follows reports from data provider Vizion of a “crash” in container bookings in April. For shipments from China to the US, bookings fell 64pc in the first week of the month compared to the previous week. Analysts blamed the crash on importers who were cancelling shipments to “reassess costs, timelines, and broader trade strategy”. This is leaving more container ships half-empty – and prompting more shipping companies to cancel voyages in a bid to reduce losses and stop fees plummeting. Imagine a truck that is speeding along at 70 miles per hour and someone slams the brakes all the way to the floor. That is essentially what we are facing. FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller is warning that trucking activity out of the L.A. area is likely to drop 50 percent and we are likely to see “massive layoffs”… Year-over-year trucking activity out of Los Angeles down 23%. It will likely drop to 50% in the coming weeks if there isn’t trade war resolution. Massive layoffs coming to the West Coast trucking sector The bottom line is that a lot less stuff is going to be coming to our stores. In fact, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council is convinced that “starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff”… Some of the products likeliest to go missing from store shelves in the coming months will be lower-cost footwear, apparel, toys and electronics, for which manufacturing is heavily concentrated in China, Gold said. Other perishable items coming from China, like apple juice and fish, have limited shelf lives and were more difficult for retailers to stockpile. “Like back during Covid where we had shortages of toilet paper, we are going to start seeing that in more and more goods,” said Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “Starting in a couple of weeks, we are just going to start running out of stuff, and if the administration waits to resolve the problem until we have shortages and hoarding, that is just too late.” His assessment was echoed by an expert that was interviewed by the New York Post… China accounts for about 54% of all US containerized imports from Asia – from electronics, toys, apparel, furniture and building materials. It generally takes two to three weeks to make the journey from China to the West Coast ports. “Things that can’t be inventoried, you’ll see (shortages) in a matter of weeks, maybe not even months,” Rita McGrath, strategic management scholar and professor at Columbia Business School, told The Post. And the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot essentially told President Trump the same thing… Earlier this week, America’s most powerful retail executives trooped into the White House to deliver a blunt prognosis: tariffs on Chinese goods risked causing “empty shelves” in two weeks without a change of course. The three companies who attended the meeting – Walmart, Target and Home Depot – are among the most exposed to the president’s policies, which include tariffs of up to 145pc on Chinese goods and higher port fees for Chinese-made vessels. We are heading into a full-blown nightmare. Even if the U.S. and China were to reach a trade deal tomorrow, and that is definitely not going to happen, it would still take an extended period of time before our supply chains returned to normal… Even if Trump were to reduce the tariffs, the disruption caused to the supply chain could take weeks or months to unravel, given the time it takes for ships to across the Pacific and for the other pieces of the supply chain to snap back into place. “You have an eight-week period where volumes are going to crash before they can even come back up, and that’s if things return to normal,” said Dean Croke, principal analyst at DAT Freight and Analytics. “All this comes at a time of the year when volumes really should start to increase.” For now, it appears that the Chinese are digging in for the long haul. On Friday, we learned that China’s Politburo has decided to implement a plan to assist those that are being impacted by the trade war… In an economic-analysis meeting on Friday, the 24-man Politburo, China’s main decision-making body headed by President Xi Jinping, said authorities would roll out specific plans to support companies and individuals affected by the trade war. They pledged to “coordinate domestic economic work with international economic and trade engagements, resolutely focus on doing our own affairs, steadfastly expand high-level opening up, and focus on stabilizing employment, businesses, markets, and expectations”, according to a meeting readout released by Xinhua. “By enhancing the certainty of high-quality development, we can effectively respond to the uncertainties brought by drastic changes in the external environment,” it said. Here in the United States, those that are getting hammered by the trade war are just going to have to deal with it. This is a really bad time for this to happen. Economic conditions were already starting to slow down, and a major conflict with Iran could erupt at any time. It is often said that when it rains, it pours. It is definitely raining now, and if the U.S. and China cannot reach a deal soon we are going to get absolutely soaked.

Title: It Is The Era Of Great Detachment: Time For A New Management Playbook

ByAnjali Chaudhry ByAnjali Chaudhry, Contributor. Isometric group of businessmen carrying piles of documents in cardboard boxes left the office, ... More unemployment, dismissal, career crisis, economic crisis leading to massive layoffs It’s a precarious time to be a manager in today’s workforce. Nearly 200,000 employees have been laid off in just weeks—a number not seen since the 2020 recession—due to sweeping efficiency mandates from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The latest workplace trend, dubbed “What did you do last week?”, pushes productivity into short, tangible bursts, leaving little room for meaningful and substantive work. Layered atop this is an unrelenting news cycle filled with tariff wars, geopolitical instability, and economic headwinds. Unsurprisingly, Glassdoor reports the lowest employee confidence index since tracking began in 2016. Gallup data reinforces the sentiment: employee engagement is at a decade low. Experts now call it the era of Great Detachment. Decades of research show that disengagement leads to lower quality work, reduced safety, and decreased profitability. In this climate, managers are in a double bind, between efficiency mandates and employee expectations. On the one hand, they are the foot soldiers having to implement the strident call for efficiency while being constrained by the lack of support or training. On the other hand, they must manage employee expectations that are stuck in the post-pandemic era. One of the very first executive orders terminated remote work arrangements in the federal government. Many businesses across industries including behemoths such as Amazon, JP Morgan, and AT&T followed suit with their own return to office mandates. Yet, employee preferences tell a different story. Remote work preference has jumped from 8% to 33% since 2019. Meanwhile, only 7% now prefer onsite work—down from 60%. These numbers reflect a major disconnect that managers are forced to reconcile, often without tools or autonomy. To answer the pressing questions—How do I motivate employees? How can I encourage innovation amidst uncertainty?—leaders must start by restoring a sense of agency in their teams. Today’s workforce is teeming with diversity—not just in demographics but in terms of what employees want, need, or even expect. The psychological contract between employer and employee is more idiosyncratic than ever making a ‘one-size fit all’ management style a very bad idea. Rather than making unilateral assumptions about what will work, it is time to engage with the employee one-on-one. Having an open and honest dialogue has always been a hallmark of a good manager. For those wondering how, two promising techniques worth investing in are active listening and appreciative enquiry. Active listening calls for demonstrating empathy and genuine interest and thus creating safe space for employees to share what they need to succeed. Appreciative enquiry is about engaging in dialogues that begin with exploring what is working and then, supporting employee to build on it. Being authentic is the key. A week-to-week accountability model creates pressure to convey busyness and deliver quick wins. Managers need to buck the trend for efficiency demands as thus avoid the cycle of “performative productivity” for employees. Instead, empower employees to prioritize meaningful work—activities that drive long-term value even if they don’t yield immediate results. Easier said than done, yes, but prioritizing employee productivity that goes beyond the optics is a win-win as it delivers value for the organization while signaling to employee that their contribution matters. Managers not as a boss but becoming what employees need, want, and expect. Today’s managers are squeezed between the top-down pressures of leadership and the bottom-up expectations of their teams. And yet, their success hinges on how their employee perform. In this new era, traditional management roles no longer suffice. To help employees do well, it behooves managers to transition from being 'Da Boss’ to becoming what employees need. Become an Agile Coach. The AI revolution is reshaping employee skill sets needed for organizations to innovate and stay competitive. Managers should partner with employees to identify gaps and create personalized development plans. This reskilling may call for supporting employees in carving out time for self-training, for sourcing learning opportunities, or connecting them to programs from educational institutions or industry groups. Serve as a Guide and Cheerleader. In environments where layoffs loom, many employees struggle to articulate their value. Be a spokesperson who brings employee challenges and concerns to leadership just as you can help amplify their contributions and offer visibility that go beyond short-term KPIs. Recalibrate Expectations and Model Resilience. Sometimes, tough love is necessary. If teamwork or long-term thinking is being undervalued in today’s ‘what’s in it for me’ mindset, it’s the manager’s job to recalibrate values and re-center collaboration. Employees look to their managers for guidance when there is ambiguity and therefore, modeling behaviors your employees need to thrive may be vital. In these uncertain times, what employee may need the most is a leader who conveys resilience, strength, and positivity.

More conference call meeting and take care his daughter child playing with cat In today’s always-on world, Employees report being perpetually in a crunch mode with long hours, unrelenting urgency and being constantly checked in. Burnout is rampant, not from lack of time off, but from the inability to truly disconnect. The busyness of work that begins as a badge of honor results significant burnout that chokes individual’s productivity. For a long time, work-life balance was viewed as a panacea. However, in today’s hyper-connected world, the idea of balance is viewed as being unrealistic and can makes things worse by setting unreasonable expectations. So, instead of work-life balance, consider the concept of work-life boundary that makes a case for clear demarcation between work and non-work lives. Boundaries can be time-bound such as the traditional 9 to 5 workday, or psychological, as in checking out mentally from the job demands to focus on personal life or even emotional, that is, a taking a break from the stresses and strain of work demands. Unfortunately, employees often lack the ability or the autonomy to engage in any of these boundary controls. Managers can help. It could mean respecting employee’s preference for personal time, empowering employees to develop a more structured work-life, or modeling behaviors that give autonomy to the employees to take a break from work. Championing and enabling work-life boundary may be key to fostering a culture of well-being where reducing anxiety, burnout, and stress is a priority. A Gallup study of Fortune 500 CHROs revealed a critical blind spot: while most expect their employees to prefer blended work-life models, almost half of the surveyed employee actually prefer clear separation. This mismatch is a silent driver of disengagement—and a unique opportunity for managers to lead differently and win employee trust by giving them autonomy to manage their preference for work-life boundary. Admittedly not all job types allow accommodating employee desire for boundary control. For instance, a 9 to 5 work routine is not an option in healthcare setting but being open and approachable to helping employees figure out strategies for crafting their work arrangement can significantly help support hyper-stressed and over-worked employees. Two decades ago, Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard penned Let My People Go Surfing, advocating for flexible time away from work. Despite generous PTO policies, a 2024 Harris Poll found that 75% of U.S. employees don’t use their allotted time off. Why? Pressure to stay connected, fear of job insecurity, and mounting workloads. Today, burnout is at crisis levels. While extended vacations may be impractical during economic downturns, the core idea remains relevant: managers must champion employee well-being to sustain performance. Productivity mandates and efficiency targets may be essential—but they must not come at the cost of human creativity and resilience. Restoring employee agency is not just a feel-good strategy. It’s a competitive advantage. Leaders who listen, advocate, coach, and set boundaries aren’t just surviving the Great Detachment—they're building the kind of workplace where innovation and engagement thrive, even in turbulent times.

Eira is an editor for Mind the Product. She's been a business journalist, editor, and copywriter for longer than she cares to think about. The Washington Post gets cosy with OpenAI, Anthropic underlines its commitment to safety and Intel proposes more layoffs and restructuring, here are the news stories that caught our attention this week. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has partnered with OpenAI to integrate the newspaper's journalism into ChatGPT. ChatGPT now provides users with summaries, quotes, and direct links to original articles from The Washington Post. The newspaper said it continues to be LLM-agnostic and build its own range of AI-powered solutions for both its business and its users. UK AI video generation startup Synthesia is set to launch a new AI agent tool designed to make videos more interactive, according to Sifted. The AI agent will be released in “the first half of this year” and is aimed at improving user engagement by allowing viewers to interact with video content, potentially transforming passive viewing into an active experience. Synthesia also reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April and received a strategic investment from Adobe Ventures. This follows a $180 million funding round in January. Chip maker Intel plans to lay off over 20% of its workforce in a bid to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. As Intel reported its Q1 earnings CEO Lip Bu-Tan also sent a message to employees that lays out plans for restructuring and expands the company’s return to office mandate from three days to four. The layoffs are thought to affect about 22,000 staff, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 at the end of 2024. In a bid to assure us of its commitment to transparency and a proactive culture of safety, Anthropic has published a report showing how its Claude AI model has been exploited by malicious actors and which details the company’s efforts to mitigate this misuse. The report, called Detecting and Countering Malicious Uses of Claude: March 2025, reports that, for instance: According to Anthropic: “This report outlines several case studies on how actors have misused our models, as well as the steps we have taken to detect and counter such misuse.” The report said that users are starting to use AI frontier models to semi-autonomously orchestrate complex abuse systems that involve many social media bots. The company expects this trend to continue as agentic AI systems improve. It also points out that generative AI can accelerate capability development for less sophisticated actors, potentially allowing them to operate at a level previously only achievable by more technically proficient individuals. Anthropic has been largely commended for its transparency in publishing this report. On LinkedIn for example, commentators praised the company for its commitment to safety.
