We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Another forecast miss from a U.S. megacap combines with caution ahead of January's employment report to keep a lid on stocks into Friday's open - with buoyant long-dated Treasuries squashing the yield curve to its flattest for the year. Much like Microsoft and Alphabet over the past couple of weeks, Amazon disappointed Wall Street late Thursday as concern about cloud computing doused revenue and profit forecasts and sent its stock down 4% overnight. The latest underwhelming outlook from the "Magnificent 7" top U.S. tech firms reins in an otherwise upbeat S&P500, with questions about heavy spends on artificial intelligence piqued again by the development of China's cheap DeepSeek model. The DeepSeek buzz, by contrast, continues to fire up Chinese stocks. They added another 1%-plus earlier on Friday despite ongoing concerns about a mounting Sino-U.S. trade war and Monday's deadline for Beijing's retaliatory tariffs. But the day's macro events will likely take precedence, with the release of the January U.S. employment report and long-term revisions of past job creation. Job growth likely slowed to 170,000 in January from just over quarter of million the prior month, partly restrained by wild fires in California and cold weather across much of the country. Those distortions add a further complication to the readout, which will include annual benchmark revisions, new population weights and updates to the seasonal adjustments. The week's sweep of other labor market reports, however, do point to some cooling of conditions - with job openings falling, layoffs rising and weekly jobless claims ticking higher. With the Federal Reserve already trying to parse the impact of President Donald Trump's new economic policies, payroll distortions just cloud the picture even further. And as Fed officials insist they can wait and see for a bit, Fed futures remain trained on two more interest rate cuts this year - resuming about midyear. The Treasury market is more encouraged though - sustaining the early week's sharp drop in 10-year yields into today's jobs report and seeing the 2-to-10 year yield curve compress to the flattest it's been in six weeks. Helping the long end this week has been reassuring signals from the Treasury's quarterly refunding report that a "terming out" of debt auctions to longer maturities is not yet in the works, as many had feared. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also insisted the new government's focus would be on getting long-term rates down rather than pressuring the Fed to ease prematurely. Reuters analysis shows Trump has placed holds on tens of billions of dollars in congressionally-approved spending for projects across the U.S. that range from Iowa soybean farmers adopting greener practices to a Virginia railway expansion. Bessent also doubled down on his view the administration wants to retain a "strong dollar" policy. But he colored that with a sideswipe. "What we don’t want is other countries to weaken their currencies, to manipulate their trade." But with the Fed on hold, central banks around the world continued easing interest rates apace this week - partly on concerns a trade tariff war will weaken their economies. With a sharp cut in its UK growth forecast, the Bank of England cut its policy rate by a quarter point on Thursday - with two of its policymakers voting for a bigger half point reduction. Sterling weakened initially, but has steadied since. Mexico's central bank also cut its interest rate by 50 basis points on Thursday - saying it could cut by a similar magnitude in the future as inflation cools and after the economy contracted slightly late last year. The European Central Bank, meantime, is expected to release its updated estimate of what it sees as a "neutral" interest rate later on Friday. That's important as it informs the ECB debate about whether it needs to cut rates below what considers neutral to revive the flagging euro zone economy. It's currently seen around 2% - 75bps below the standing policy rate. In thrall to the payrolls release, the dollar index was steady on Friday. Dollar/yen briefly notched a new low for the year, however, as Bank of Japan tightening speculation simmers. In Europe, stocks stalled near record highs as the heavy earnings season there unfolded. Banks there have a been a standout winner this week and again on Friday. Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest lender, was up 7.1% after it posted record annual profits and launch a new share buyback programme. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * U.S. January employment report, University of Michigan February consumer survey, December consumer credit; Canada Jan employment report; Mexico Jan inflation * European Central Bank updates its estimate of "R*" neutral interest rate * Federal Reserve Board Governors Michelle Bowman and Adriana Kugler speak; Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks * U.S. corporate earnings: Cboe Global Markets, Fortive, Kimco Realty * Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba visits United States (By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Apple Kills AR Glasses, Hello Alexa AI, Reality Labs’ Reality, More Cinematic AI

Apple reportedly stops developing AR smart glasses. It will continue to support its $3500 Vision Pro, introduced just a year ago. Apple is banking on Vision Pro gaining traction with enterprises, having apparently forgotten the sad fate of Microsoft’s HoloLens. Having fallen grievously behind on AI with its shockingly lame once and future agent, Siri, Apple continues to spend billions on exactly the wrong things, forfeiting the wearable AI market to Meta, and betting on enterprise MR. Don’t sell your Apple stock yet, though. The great thing about being the biggest tech company in the world, with a market cap of $3.55 Billion, is that when Siri is finally the cheerful and useful assistant promised in 2012, it will kick every other AI off of the iPhone and we will spend all our waking hours with it inside the Apple ecosystem. An attendee wears the Amazon Echo Frames smart glasses with Alexa during the Consumer Electronics ... [+] Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 7, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Hello, Siri. It’s me, Alexa. With OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Grok sucking the AI air out of the room, it’s easy to forget about Amazon’s multibillion dollar investment in Anthropic. Now Amazon is preparing to launch an AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant, Alexa, marking its most significant enhancement in over a decade. The new Alexa engages in multi-turn dialogues, remembers user preferences, and can work autonomously as your agent. Amazon’s seemingly forgotten ‘Alexa everywhere’ strategy has new relevance as AI agents begin to infiltrate our daily lives. The service will initially be free for Prime members, but Amazon hopes to eventually charge $5 to $10 per month. An event is scheduled for February 26 to showcase the new features. To its credit, Meta seems to finally grok that Mixed Reality has become a mixed reality for them. Their one bright spot, the AI-enabled Meta Ray Ban audio smart glasses, ate $100 M in marketing on its way to Super Bowl Sunday. They sold a million Ray Bans in Q4. If so, it cost Meta $100 in marketing dollars per unit sold. This is the success story. It should be no surprise, therefore, that in a supposedly ‘leaked’ email sent to Reality Labs employees by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, 2025 is a “make or break year” for the division. That sounds a lot like “the year of efficiency,” which saw mass layoffs at the company. He singled out Meta’s disastrous metaverse venture, Horizon, which has evolved into a weak Roblox competitor. Their AR/VR Reality Labs division earned a record $1 B revenue Q4, but it still lost $4.4 B that same quarter. Reality Labs’ total losses for the last 12-month period are $17.7 B. Even though Meta has invested nearly one hundred billion dollars (not a typo) in their misguided metaverse, they could, and maybe should, walk away. $100 B is just 5.7% of Meta’s $1.76 trillion market cap today. The stock would probably go up on the announcement. Search bar on yellow background. Vector illustration Google is offering "voluntary" buyouts to hardware and platform employees ahead of expected cuts. The "Platform and Devices" unit includes more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest, according to internal documents we viewed. The buyouts are a signal of expected cuts within Google as it continues prioritizing, and utilizing, artificial intelligence. A skilled software developer, augmented with AI, can do the work of two or three people. If AI hasn’t made you a better, more productive coder, a voluntary buyout might be attractive. Olas home page. Olas, also known as Autonolas DAO, has secured $13.8 million in funding to launch Pearl, a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace for artificial intelligence agents. 1kx led the new funding round, with participation from Tioga Capital, Sigil Fund, Zee Prime Capital, and Spaceship DAO. Founded in 2021, Olas develops autonomous AI agents—software capable of performing tasks and making decisions with minimal human intervention in social media management and cryptocurrency trading. Olas also introduced an accelerator program offering up to $1 million in grants to developers for integrating new agents into the Pearl platform. Riffusion, a San Francisco-based AI startup, has launched a free web platform enabling users to create original music using their AI model, Fuzz. Fuzz generates complete songs from text descriptions, audio clips, or visual prompts and learns individual users’ musical preferences over time. This release comes as major tech companies like Google, Meta, and TikTok explore similar AI-driven audio synthesis technologies. Notably, artists like Alex Pall and Drew Taggart (The Chainsmokers) serve as advisors for Riffusion, highlighting the platform's potential in the music industry. Riffusion's approach positions AI as a collaborative tool for both professional musicians and casual enthusiasts, offering an intuitive interface without subscription fees. Riffusion, an AI-driven music generation startup, secured $4 million in seed funding on October 17, 2023. Greycroft led the investment round, with participation from South Park Commons and Sky9 Capital. The company plans to use the funds to enhance its AI capabilities, expand its music library, and improve user experience. Zynga has launched "The Dragon Egg Hunt," a global treasure hunt within its puzzle RPG, Game of Thrones: Legends, powered by Google Maps. Participants navigate a 2D map inspired by the show's opening credits, utilizing Google's Photorealistic 3D Tiles to search for virtual dragon eggs at key locations worldwide. The event offers surprises like incentivized codes and in-game rewards. Players collectively work to unlock milestone rewards and can win prizes, including a Google Pixel 9 Pro and Google Play gift cards. Sweepstakes run until February 24, 2025. Cinematic AI OpenAI’s Sora Filmmaking Tool Meets Resistance in Hollywood. Bloomberg reports the studios and OpenAI have not settled on a deal framework that would work for both sides financially and address concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, which was an impotant issue in two labor strikes that paralyzed Hollywood in 2023. Diretors who have worked with Sora say it’s difficult to control, and far from ready for a commercial role. Naturally, the creator of this exceptional music video for exiled Turkish rapper Ezhel, Öner S. Biberkökü, is a director. He made the film by himself in six weeks. It cost $2,800 in AI generation fees. “Using the possibilities of AI,” Biberkökü said in an email, “I created an official music video for Ezhel from the country he deeply misses—without ever meeting him in person. He loved the video and it became his official music video.” Sebastian Ungrad, an art director at Munich’s Storybook Studios, a renowned AI production company, made “Recursion” while on vacation. “I read the incredible book, , by Blake Crouch and felt inspired to create a trailer for a TV series adaptation that doesn’t exist (yet)!

Music by: John Utah - Run for the Man, M83 - Solitude (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) Native Foreign partner Nick Cleverov directed this co-production with TCL studios, and was selected as a Finalist in Project Odyssey's Narrative Competition. “The story is based on an idea I had a long time ago about a future where artists paint human memories to make androids feel alive,” Cleverov wrote on Linkedin. About a dozen people worked on the project which was made with a mix of generative AI, voice talent, and a new post pipeline. “The gatekeeping that once made filmmaking an exclusive endeavor is eroding, allowing more creatives to explore their visions in a meaningful way,” he said.

Title: Disney Falls Further on Fortune’s Most Admired Companies List for 2025
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-falls-further-on-fortunes-most-admired-companies-list-for-2025/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:54:12Z
Full Content:
The Walt Disney Company has seen its reputation fall further, with a drop on Fortune’s 2025 list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. This post takes a look at what changed, how Disney performed relative to the competition, along with our commentary about what this does–and does not–mean. For the 18th year running, Apple takes the #1 spot atop the list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. This is the 27th year of the list, which is created in partnership between Fortune and Korn Ferry. The World’s Most Admired Companies list highlights organizations most respected by their peers, with executives emphasizing financial stability, innovation, respected leadership, and expansion of global businesses. After Apple, the 2025 top five includes Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Berkshire Hathaway. Several of these companies have been on the Most Admired list for years, a testament to their reputational stability during volatile times both politically and culturally. Berkshire Hathaway, for example, has been atop its category for every single year of the survey’s 27-year existence. Otherwise, Fortune calls attention to the tumult and turmoil of the last year for many companies. Last year, it specifically drew attention to Disney’s drop, and the various reasons for that. This year, Fortune discusses how Ralph Lauren took the top spot in apparel for the first time since 2014, dethroning Nike, which had enjoyed 10 straight years at No. 1 but suffered in 2024 from a sharp revenue slump exacerbated by a dearth of new products. In a food service industry roiled by inflation, McDonald’s staged a huge comeback thanks to Grimace (my explanation, not Fortune’s) and thanks to the $5 Happy Meal (Fortune’s explanation), finishing first. That ended a 12-year reign at No. 1 for coffee giant Starbucks, whose growth has leveled off amid dissatisfaction among customers and employees alike. These survey results suggest that industry insiders believe both Nike and Starbucks would benefit from a reboot, just as they felt with Disney last year. Obviously, executives do not believe Disney did enough to burnish its business reputation…but it also didn’t inflict much new damage, either. Last year, Disney ranked #12 overall among the companies from across the globe on the All-Star list of Fortune’s Most Admired Companies, which was a fall of 6 places as compared to last year. For the 2025 list, the drop is last extreme–Disney is down one spot, to #13. Honestly, contrasted with the company’s poor performance on all of these lists over the last few years, this might be considered a small victory by some. Separately, Disney actually improved its position on the most admired media & entertainment companies list for 2025. Last year, it lost the #1 spot to Netflix and fell to #4. Disney had held the top spot for 20 consecutive years prior to last year. For 2025, Disney bounces back to claim the #3 spot among entertainment giants. The methodology for choosing the top-ranked companies within industries is different than that for choosing All-Stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the All-Star list, but is #1 on the media list. Methodology matters here as the “how” of this list is indicative of what it does (and doesn’t) reflect. Fortune’s annual list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” (WMAC) is a collaboration with Korn Ferry to survey corporate reputations. The process begins with the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue, along with international companies with revenues of $10 billion or more. From there, the candidate pool is reduced to the highest-revenue companies in each industry. To determine the best-regarded companies in 52 industries, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors, and analysts to rate enterprises within their own industry on nine criteria, including investment value, quality of management, caliber of products, ability to attract talent, etc. To select the 50 All-Stars, Korn Ferry asks nearly 4,000 executives and insiders to select the 10 companies they admired most. They select from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys, plus those that finished in the top 20% of their industry. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry. The difference in the voting rolls explains why some results can seem at odds with each other. Here’s Fortune’s 2025 Top 20 All-Star List: Turning to commentary, Fortune’s WMAC list is fascinating. However, I also don’t think it’s as important as the similar Axios Harris Poll that typically comes out later in the spring. At least, not from the perspective of anyone here who, presumably, cares more about the guest experience and less about the corporate employee one. I’m really looking forward to the 2025 Axios-Harris list, and seeing whether less controversy (hopefully!) results in a higher ranking. It should be apparent in reading the methodology section for the Fortune WMAC list that the critical difference with this Fortune list is that it’s voted on by industry executives, directors, and analysts rather than the general public. Leaders within corporations prioritize different qualities or characteristics than do consumers. Metrics like investment value, quality of management, ability to attract talent, and social responsibility may not matter to the average American responding to such a survey. There are scenarios where “investment value” could be diametrically opposed to what consumers prize. Analysts might love Lightning Lane Premier Pass and the elimination of Disney’s Magical Express, thinking “that Chapek fella had some good ideas.” Just gonna go out on a limb and assume that would not be the consensus among consumers, though. Where there is overlap, it’s primarily with quality of the product and maybe of management, but the latter is arguably a bit too inside baseball for the average American. It matters to people who read sites like this one–around here, Bob Iger and Josh D’Amaro aren’t just household names, there are strong opinions about the dynamic duo. But I’d bet that around half of Axios Harris poll respondents recognize Bob Iger, and less than 5% know the name Josh D’Amaro. Never underestimate the knowledge gap between super-fans and regular people (can you name the CEOs of every company in the Fortune top 10?!) So really, it’s the products and public-facing experience that matters to you and I. The discrepancies between Fortune’s industry-specific and All-Star lists even hint at this. Within an industry, there’s more insight into the competition. Zoom out and ask all executives from the list, and there’s still more knowledge relative to the general public, but it’s still a bit of a smell test. They probably know about the proxy fight, performance of the stock, and whatever else they’ve read about Bob Iger in the WSJ (a lot of it has not been good). Point being, the ongoing layoffs and business restructurings and yet another proxy fights and succession struggles and stock underperformance and constant palace intrigue/ongoing Battle of the Bobs probably took their toll on Disney’s reputation in the business community. But then again, the executives’ kids likely liked Moana 2 and Inside Out 2, and that also counts for something–silly as it might sound. So how is the Fortune list relevant to you, as a fan of Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Frankly, it’s a lot less meaningful than the Axios Harris poll. (That’s the one I’m anxiously awaiting.) Companies can overperform on this list while offering awful consumer products and services. Or vice-versa. To be sure, there’s a lot of overlap between this list and the Axios Harris poll. But then there are companies like Berkshire Hathaway, which is beloved in the corporate world but more of an unknown among the general public. It has ranked highly every single year of the Fortune WMAC list; it didn’t make the cut at all–good or bad–on the Axios Harris poll. Other companies like Walmart, Fedex, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, American Express, and others rank very differently–or not at all–on the Axios Harris list. My expectation and hope is that the Walt Disney Company will actually see a healthy rebound on the Axios Harris list. Disgruntled theme park fans may not want to hear this, and point to unpopular decisions like replacing MuppetVision, razing the Rivers of America, poorly-received ride reimaginings, DAS changes, Lightning Lane Premier Pass, and so forth. But that stuff is unpopular with hardcore fans, not the general public. If it’s on their radar at all (and it mostly isn’t), the perception is probably very different. When I’ve explained to normie friends what’s happening, they’re more focused on the Monsters, Inc. Doors Coaster and Cars Land parts of the news. Much more importantly, Disney absolutely dominated the box office last year. Inside Out 2, Moana 2, and Deadpool & Wolverine were all huge hits. Other films performed really well and added to Disney’s box office haul, but I’m skeptical those movies (e.g. Alien Romulus) would register with the public as being “Disney,” and that’s what matters for the purpose of the survey. Streaming is probably the biggest wildcard…and also the biggest blind spot for me. Despite headlines about it shedding subscribers, Disney+ continues to grow in the United States (it’s losing them internationally). I don’t know whether this is just inertia and/or Bluey, or if people generally like Disney+ content. I see a lot of complaints about the Star Wars and Marvel shows on streaming, but I have no clue whether this is actually the public consensus, manufactured outrage, or a bit of both. Regardless, I’d still expect Disney to improve on the Axios-Harris poll. The last year has been largely controversy-free for the company, at least in terms of coverage you’d see on the nightly news. Disney vs. DeSantis is long-settled, the last proxy fight has been over for a while, and it’s been over a year since the dust-up between Bob Iger and Elon Musk. There are certainly assorted “controversies” within the fan community, but as far as the broader Disney-consuming public goes, I can’t really think of anything from the last ~365 days. It’s been a mostly positive year for Disney on balance, and given that, I suspect the box office results, strong guest satisfaction scores for the parks, and Disney+ domestic subscriber count will matter above all else in dictating Disney’s position on the Axios-Harris poll. But I suppose we shall see. Turning back to the Fortune WMAC list, this makes a difference from a guest-facing perspective in Disney’s ability to attract and retain talent, and the downstream effects of that. Disney has long been able to compete with corporate giants offering better compensation because of the name Disney and what that means. Talented professionals wanted to work for Imagineering because of the name cachet and being part of something cool and special. On a frontline level, one of the reasons the College Program has been so successful is because Disney is a powerful word on a résumé. Recruiters overlook the role and are more interested in the experience with the Walt Disney Company. Ask anyone who has worked for Disney at any level–they’ve almost certainly received more questions about Disney during subsequent job interviews than anything else. The consequence of Disney not being able to attract top talent would be a future with fewer Lanny Smootses or Joe Rohdes. Not being able to make the same strides in robotics, groundbreaking innovations that earn patents, or advancements in Audio Animatronics. And that’s just in Imagineering, one relatively small silo of Disney. The Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies list also matters a lot to Disney. If you look through the archives on the Walt Disney Company’s corporate website–the one that focuses on investor relations, careers, and the company’s impact–there used to be annual press releases touting its position on the Fortune WMAC list. The last one of those I could find, not-so-coincidentally, is 2023. The bottom line is that there’s a direct nexus between Disney’s corporate reputation among leaders in the business world and among fans. It certainly is not as immediate, but there are real world consequences for a company seeing its reputation falter. A drop from #12 to #13 certainly is not a five-alarm fire, but as a fan who wants Disney to attract the best and the brightest, it’s also not great that they’ve fallen from #6 to #13 in the span of two years, and are no longer #1 in the entertainment industry. Long-term, the consequence of this is that Disney could lose talent to Netflix, Amazon, Marriott, or even Comcast (we’ve already seen this happen with layoffs at Imagineering resulting in an influx of talent to Universal Creative–hopefully the same thing now happens in reverse with Epic Universe finished and WDI needing to staff up). For many Disney fans, being an Imagineer is the holy grail–but for a lot of actual job candidates, it’s one of many options. There are also other important positions in Burbank, Glendale, Central Florida and beyond that need to be able to attract top talent. They flocked to Disney in the past because it was a beloved American institution, with an unrivaled reputation. Let’s hope that reputation is restored in the years to come, among both the general public and corporate leaders. Need Disney trip planning tips and comprehensive advice?

What’s your take on Disney spot on the 2025 Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies list? Think the company can bounce back with a less tumultuous year? Think a clear succession plan, better stock performance, and another year removed from controversies will help? Hope Disney gets its groove back soon? Do you agree or disagree with our assessment? Any questions we can help you answer? Hearing your feedback—even when you disagree with us—is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! Tom, I know you’re a Disney super fan, but part of what I admire about this blog is your willingness to admit Disney is far from perfect in a lot of ways. So with the guest experience still lacking (the ol’ “paying more for less” thing) amongst a lot of other issues, kind of curious why you’d be rooting for Disney to climb the ranks in the Axios-Harris list (or any other poll)? I’m not super knowledgeable in this department or anything – I’ve just become kind of fascinated with Disney as a business lately – but my thought is that maybe continued tumbling down the ranks in various polls would concern Disney leadership and perhaps motivate some positive change for guests and/or employees? I’m not sure how positive reinforcement for Disney’s current behavior really helps anyone? PS, my MIL sent me a photo of her 1993 receipt from MGM Studios today, and their family of four got in for a total of $103! My husband looked, and that would be $217 in today’s dollars. It’s costing our family of four nearly $600 for that in May 2025…that made me feel a certain kind of way… What I find strange is, in spite of all the cash-wringing practices Disney has enacted over the past four years, the stock price is still about half of what it was four years ago. With all rabid fan perspectives put completely aside, from a business perspective, the stock price matters. And cash-wringing isn’t just bad for guests and customers. It can result in huge losses like Disney experienced with their Galactic Star Cruiser debacle. (They still haven’t learned lessons from the initial roll out of California Adventure. When you promise the moon and deliver rocks, the bottom line suffers.) I’m not a business expert, but it seems pretty obvious to me Disney did too much overseas expansion too quickly. The company is overextended and cannot adequately maintain the infrastructure they have in place while simultaneously designing and building new attractions. It’s just bizarre to hear about billions of dollars in new “investment” while the parks have just so many burned out light bulbs, rides that constantly break down and a Disneyland Tomorrowland which isn’t much more than a ghost town. Okay, here’s the outlook for one fan who goes just once a year but spends enormously on that trip. 1) Taking the country out of Country Bears and making it all about IP makes me want to throw up. 2) Bulldozing Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island for a not (for me) nostalgic attraction is enough for me to never plan a future trip (after my early May trip.) 3) Eliminating Muppets Courtyard is a sacrilege to the memory of Jim Henson – destroying his last project?? That should be a National Historic Landmark? 4 Getting rid of Dinoland instead of putting Tropical Americas elsewhere is an insult to the funny and creative Imagineers who created this very cool homage to 1950’s American road culture. I’m going in May basically to meet the characters and have my last luscious Via Napoli pizza. I feel the exact opposite for every single one of your points. Thank you for not going to the parks again, one less person in line …however, I agree with every one of your points. Well stated! WMAC seems to apply more to the views of the Wall Street elite and executives in other companies who are on the outside looking in. I would be more interested in what the day-to-day employees think. A lot of those places are toxic places to work. I have friends who worked at Apple and simply quit due to the burnout and demands. I knew a couple of animators at Disney, who essentially said the same thing — that their talents went pretty much unappreciated. So I would not put much stock in what Wall Street or management says about “what” is to be admired in a company like Disney. It seems now to be a company of bean counters and profit centers. They want to squeeze every dollar they can out of the customer or out of the hides of the workers. CJ: “…dropped from 3rd most powerful person in Hollywood to 9th” Toby: “[Do they] still make the playoffs, or is the cutoff line…” CJ: “They take it seriously.” https://youtu.be/FsM_eeUyOBs?si=wHlNzqBE6s8fFV3I&t=78 Classic. Such sharp writing and dialogue. It’s been too long since we’ve had a good Aaron Sorkin show. Sports Night is one of my favorite shows to this day–and one of the most underrated of all time. Even if the people voting on the list are industry executives, directors, and analysts, I wouldn’t be surprised if the rankings reflected residual effects from Florida’s most recent culture war battle. As for the effects of this list on Imagineering candidates, my sources inside Imagineering don’t care about the list, as they are the biggest Disney fans around. Yes, a lot of people bounce around between Universal and Disney, depending on which one has active projects at any given time. Given the opportunity, however, to work at either Universal or Disney, most would pick Disney. Where Disney could have a problem is with future generations of Imagineers, but I doubt kids in middle and high school putting in extra hours studying math and science so they can be Imagineers someday care about the list. “As for the effects of this list on Imagineering candidates, my sources inside Imagineering don’t care about the list, as they are the biggest Disney fans around.” You only know who you know, though. Imagineering is definitely NOT just populated by Disney super fans–far from it. That’s more the case in Florida and internationally, but Glendale is a mix. WDI is a big organization itself, and I’d imagine there are some silos where it is more or less “acceptable” to be hardcore fans. (I also only know who I know!) That makes sense. Glendale pulls from a talent pool with more employment options than Orlando. I really have no comment about where Disney lies on this list, but looking at the top five, I haven’t yet stopped laughing. Apparently their criteria for “admiration ” isn’t mine! I could see quibbling with 4 of the top 5, but not Nvidia. If you’re not familiar with the company, it’s worth reading up on its CEO, Jensen Huang. Dude is basically the personification of the American dream. I feel similarly about Warren Buffett, but I guess I could see others not admiring Berkshire Hathaway. Love Disney, but recently sold all my DIS stock. Prices are soaring, but customer experience is not. I feel they should be expanding much bigger and faster with all their cash flow. They also need to stay very far away from politics and woke ideas. I agree that Disney has made a number of mistakes in recent years, but please explain to me what part of “charging more for less” is “woke”. The day can’t come soon enough when people stop using that word to describe anything they don’t personally like. Yes, Disney never used to have politics in their movies. Except for when they created the three Caballeros to counter nazi propaganda efforts in north america. Or when they took a stand against animal cruelty with 101 dalmatians or talked about women’s rights in Mary Poppins. Or income inequality in robin hood, or women’s autonomy and toxic masculinity in beauty and the beast, and women’s autonomy again in aladdin. Or fascism and environmentalism in the lion king, or racism and environmentalism in pocahontas, or racism, ableism, and religious hypocrisy in hunchback of notre dame. Or sexism in mulan, or colonialism in a bugs life. Ratatouille is about how anyone can be good at something it doesn’t matter where they come from from which is the exact discussion at the heart of the DEI conversation, wall-e is about environmentalism, princess and the frog tackles racial bias. Or all the zillions of gay allegories like frozen, little mermaid, and lilo and stitch where a misunderstood person leaves where they’re from and finds community, love and family by embracing what others condemn about them. Or racism and political fearmongering in zootopia Yes, other than all of that, Disney just started talking about “politics” recently. Aeryn, I think you forgot Donald Duck fighting the Nazis on the home front. I also forgot Tarzan! The whole movie is about different forms of masculinity, comparing paternal masculinity, industrious masculinity, toxic masculinity etc Clayton is literally killed by his own toxic masculinity What’s to admire about a company that continues to fill executive pockets while magic makers (cast members) live in their cars because they cannot afford to live where parks are located. Without doing a deep dive into the numbers, I would hazard a guess that almost all of the companies topping this list have similar c-suite to average worker pay disparities. We just know about Disney’s because we’re all fans of the company, so we pay attention to this stuff. But it’s hardly unique in that regard. The outliers are the companies with CEOs taking little pay and offering better competition to the frontline (of the companies here, Costco comes to mind). To your point, though, this is another reason why average Americans may not put much weight in this list. Then again, if that’s the primary criteria, you aren’t going to admire many companies.

Title: Bandai Namco reportedly lost over 100 staff in the last year

Following project cancellations. Bandai Namco has reportedly lost over a hundred staff in the last year. As reported by Automaton, according to the online database of Japan's Pension Service, the company's staff headcount dropped from 1294 on 1st April 2024 to 1177 on 4th February 2025 - a decrease of 117 people. It's unclear which projects these employees were working on, or whether they left the company voluntarily or not. The news follows a report from Bloomberg last year stating the company was cutting its Japanese workforce and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand. What's more, while staff had not been directly laid off, around 200 employees were sent to what's known as "oidashi beya" - rooms where staff are left without a project to work on, often used instead for job hunting. These rooms are utilised in Japan due to strict labour laws making layoffs difficult to enforce. At the time, Bandai Namco denied using these rooms. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily." Eurogamer has once again contacted Bandai Namco to confirm this latest loss of staff, but the company declined to comment. However, these numbers from Japan's Pension Service do appear to line up with Bloomberg's report. The Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled by Bandai Namco in August last year, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down last year. Several other projects have reportedly been cancelled or paused, including a project commissioned by Nintendo. Last month, the Bandai Namco-published Unknown 9 franchise was cancelled as the developer admitted it "didn't come near" expectations. Next for Bandai Namco will be the network test for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign later this month. The news also follows the bizarre LinkedIn update from Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada who, after posting he was looking for new job opportunities, claimed he just wants to "meet more people and expand my horizons in the future".

Title: From Quest To Horizon: How Meta's Shifting Priorities Are Affecting Developers
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/from-quest-to-horizon-how-metas-shifting-priorities-are-affecting-developers/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T00:00:02Z
Full Content:
With concerns about declining sales and discoverability, UploadVR spoke with nearly two dozen VR studios to discuss the current state of shipping VR games on Quest. It's become increasingly apparent since last year that things are not what they once were, despite Meta's lead in VR and AR seeming unassailable. Meta's Reality Labs division is reporting record revenues, and Quest 3S seems to be selling well. Yet for many developers making VR games, the mood has soured. Some developers are buoyed by revenue through subscription programs like the Quest+ gaming catalog, with every new Quest 3S headset including three months of Quest+. However, many others are now struggling to find sales and to support their teams long-term. UploadVR spoke to developers with concerns about declining sales to learn about the current state of VR game development on Meta's store. Quest 3S seemingly had a successful launch late last year, with pack-in title Batman: Arkham Shadow reaching over one million players. Reality Labs as a whole earned its highest ever quarterly revenue last quarter. But before his departure, Meta's original technical guide through VR John Carmack warned that “setting out to build the metaverse is not the best way to wind up with the Metaverse.” Carmack noted: A memo was recently leaked from Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth noting “Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance.” 2025, it is said then, will determine whether Meta's hardware and metaverse division is “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure”. The wider video games industry continues seeing layoffs despite the industry's market value reportedly reaching around $184.3 billion. Factors cited by some include overinvestment following the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing development costs. Hearing about newly affected studios ending projects or reducing team sizes feels like a weekly occurrence and, for some, Quest is no longer delivering some studios the same returns they've once seen. The pace of complaints from developers seemed to speed up after the Meta Horizon App's redesign back in July, with many citing the transition in their interviews as a sore spot. For some, the store is still profitable, with Eye of the Temple only recouping its development costs after being ported to Meta's headset, even as Gorilla Tag cleared more than $100 million. But for developers seeing declining sales, what exactly is going wrong? Many point to issues concerning discoverability, curation, Meta's increased focus on Horizon Worlds and the decision to merge App Lab with the main store as a tipping point for revenue decline. Most studios requested anonymity in their talks with UploadVR to protect their relationships with Meta, though Andrew Eiche at Owlchemy Labs, Kevin Walker at Middle Man Games, and Alex Nasanov at iTales VR agreed to go on the record. As part of our discussion, Eiche made clear his comments are solely on his and Owlchemy's behalf and do not represent Google, which owns the veteran studio. Most developers feel Horizon Worlds is getting increased attention at the expense of store apps, mentioning it when asked how they view Meta's general direction. Several suggested this approach indicates Meta is pushing a mobile approach aimed at younger audiences, trying to entice young players who have no wallets by prioritizing free-to-play content. They perceive Meta as promoting Horizon Worlds as the default experience for VR users rather than paid apps on the storefront. “This is not the direction I would have chosen,” Andrew Eiche said over a video call with UploadVR. “I think they made a video game console and they want a general computing device.” Notably, Dimensional Double Shift from Owlchemy released as a free multiplayer app on Meta's storefront after a string of paid releases. Technically, this content type isn't supported by Horizon Worlds, which still requires physical input of some kind. Multiple developers sent us pages of screenshots of search results featuring what look like Horizon Worlds clones of premium games competing with paid work, and sometimes winning in search rankings. “This is bad for us devs. It's bad for consumers,” states Kevin Walker. “And when they show free [Gorilla Tag] clones above paid apps, I don't see how it's even good for Meta.” Eiche and others praised the Quest Store for what it's delivered in the past, with multiple platinum releases clearing one million units. Others understand Meta's priorities, but the prevailing sentiment in our talks with developers is concern and frustration. Here's a series of selected direct quotes from the developers with paid releases on the Quest Store who wished to remain anonymous: Horizon Worlds and its free destinations competing for search, promotion, and time in VR is one aspect of paid store developer frustrations, but Meta also stopped curating content on the storefront more generally in 2024. Many studios criticized the lasting impact of Meta getting rid of App Lab last year, which arrived in two stages. Scott Albright, CEO for Combat Waffle Studios, previously told UploadVR last year that he wasn't a fan of App Lab being discontinued, and that sentiment's only grown. Many developers see the move to make the store “open” as being a good one overall because it lowers barriers to entry. One studio called it “an inevitable step” for any platform looking to grow, and a positive change. That same developer, however, suggested Meta “wasn’t ready to manage the vast amount of very unpolished content and the lack of a warning time.” “I believe that this has also shifted the type of content that gets visibility on the store now and, as a consequence, opened up its doors for developers with new approaches to VR game development and also new ways of monetization. This has caused legacy devs and publishers having to adapt to new times, which takes a while,” said another developer. Here's another set of direct quotations from developers on their issues with the changes around curation: Some studios consider the removal process was rushed, though others argue that App Lab wasn't really merged in. One team says Meta “removed the main store” and put everyone on App Lab. Eiche says they changed the store to be like Google Play or Apple's App Store, though he concedes there are arguments both ways with an open platform. In recent times, the Horizon Store's home page seems to have improved when searching on desktop or inside the headset. Though the mobile app still prioritizes mobile Horizon Worlds content when you load it up, with no means to adjust this, the desktop homepage begins by highlighting the most popular apps and top-selling that week. But it is not long before you reach the 'Browse All' category, where listed entries often have some variation on the words “Gorilla,” “Tag” or “monkey.” These often outrank Gorilla Tag itself due to inflated ratings from a small number of users. Many of those we spoke with view the Quest Store's current discoverability poorly, and worse than Steam. One developer likened it to entering a department store filled with cheap clothes during the holidays. One studio called being discovered their biggest issue next to funding, while another said navigating the store has become “unnecessarily difficult.” Another expressed frustrations that promised support over marketing and reaching the main store never materialized. Adding mixed reality labels on the developer dashboard side are still curated by Meta, yet other genres are not. Some genres in the developer settings aren’t reflected as filters on the actual store, which is causing some frustrations, while others don't show the full selection of games in a specific genre. Just how badly have developers been affected saleswise? The exact percentage naturally varies depending on who you ask, but some of those who aren't supported by a platform subscription program suggest revenue drop-offs for their games between 50 - 80% for 2024 compared to 2023. Sales impact was much more visible in the second half of 2024 for many. One studio explains that developers usually expect a big spike in sales when a new headset launches, even more so when you factor in Christmas sales. One studio says that didn't happen with Quest 3S, despite retailers like Amazon reporting high sales. “When Quest 3s launched, you couldn't even tell from the sales data that a new and affordable headset had launched… I think that this is not necessarily due to Quest 3s selling so much less, but due to those players not reaching the store and buying games,” states one studio. One developer believes Meta should implement more mechanisms like Steam Daily Deals to provide indie titles enough sales to cover months of costs. Another points toward both declining sales across the entire gaming industry and a shift toward younger audiences. “This demographic typically spends less compared to adult gamers, raising the question: where have the adult VR gamers gone?” Of course, games aren't guaranteed to be a success at launch, no matter the platform. Even with strong reviews and great marketing, games sometimes just fail to land with an audience for a myriad of reasons. Critical success doesn't equal commercial success and, for a niche market, the end of 2024 delivered a relentless stream of new releases. From October to December, the following games saw release on various platforms: And that's just some of the list. I've never seen such a hefty lineup of big VR games released in such a short timeframe. Some of that could be attributed to the Quest 3S launch, and while most developers we spoke with didn't have the most positive results, it's not impossible to break through or at least get close. In a separate interview outside this report, Flat2VR Studios advised Trombone Champ: Unflattened was close to hitting sales expectations despite the fierce competition. So there's a mix of heavy competition, poor discoverability, search issues, increasing promotion of Horizon Worlds, and a userbase that perhaps isn’t big enough to support such a wide range of games. This hasn't gone well for many, set in context of wider economic issues like the increasing cost of living leaving people with less disposable income. “There's a bigger, more insidious core problem that's happening. The amount of money that consumers are willing to spend on apps that you pay for is shrinking,” Eiche said. Owlchemy doesn't believe declining sales are necessarily due to games reaching the tail-end of their life cycle. He suggested Vacation Simulator and Cosmonious High — which recently received price cuts — have discoverability issues, while Job Simulator still regularly charts in the top 10. Even in such a high spot though, Owlchemy's debut hit is making less money than it once did. “I would love to be like, 'Hey, Job Simulator had a great run.' That's great. But then when I see it in the top 10 or in the top four but the amount it's making is an order of magnitude less, like half as much as it did before,” Eiche said. “That to me says that the overall amount of money being put into the store is shrinking.” This doesn't necessarily mean there are fewer Quest users, but it suggests more are opting for free-to-play experiences over premium content. Meta Quest+ is a subscription program providing access to two pre-selected monthly games and a rotating selection of VR titles via its Games Catalog. It's drawn the inevitable comparisons with Xbox Game Pass, and Sony's own PlayStation Plus service. Meta includes a 3-month subscription with every new Quest 3S headset, meaning anyone who received a headset over Christmas still has this. For some developers, revenue from the programs can close the gap with revenue lost from store sales. Releasing games on Quest+ immediately feels like a “double-edged sword” to some though, with games failing to reach sustainability across both store and subscription channels. Another developer expressed skepticism about subscriptions wholesale, calling the model a “catastrophic disaster” for the music industry. Others just see it as a new name for curation at Meta. “It is a great option and helps users discover great content BUT it cannot be [the] only method for doing so,” one developer said. “Which currently it is.” Some believe Quest+ gives users fewer reasons to go looking for games to purchase, stating this complements Meta's push with moving users to free apps. Despite this, most developers agreed the subscription service is great for consumers. “Quest+ is a form of curation because anything where you pick out apps is a form of curation. I think that's another line of business,” says Andrew Eiche, who calls Quest+ a good way of recommending titles. “I don’t see Meta pushing that as the answer.” With declining Quest sales being a common issue across these studios, has this lead to an uplift in sales across other headsets for multiplatform developers? Based on the developers we spoke with, generally no, but with a few notable exceptions: Still, the exceptions are interesting to note. For example, Into The Radius hit 800k sales while its currently PC VR only sequel reached nearly $3m revenue in early access so far. One CEO reported 90% of sales came from Steam compared to Quest, attributing this to being featured on the Steam front page after participating in themed sales and festivals. Another developer saw 2024 on Steam outperform their sales in 2023 and 2022. Even with Quest being their main source of revenue, one studio advised the difference with Steam is “shrinking more and more.” One studio told UploadVR lower than expected sales on Quest means they'll be focusing on multiplatform launches in the future, naming Steam as a certainty, while PS VR2 and Android XR are “maybe.” GDC's State of the Industry report, which surveyed 3500 developers, advised 59% of VR developers are working on Quest/Horizon games, 31% for SteamVR, 16% for PS VR2, and 8% for Apple visionOS. PlayStation VR2 also appears to be another beneficiary following decreased sales on Quest. Across the last few months, we've seen an increasing number of developers announce ports for Sony's headset. Sinn Studio co-founder Almir Brljak confirmed that Swordsman VR “sold more copies” on PS VR2 than Quest in December, calling the Sony headset's pricing “a huge barrier.” While not a direct indicator of sales, Skydance's Behemoth and Metro Awakening all show more user reviews on PS VR2 than Quest, though Steam shows the highest review count for Metro. Touching upon Into The Radius' success, Fast Travel Games CMO Andreas Juliusson recently stated that sales on PS VR2 “exceeded our expectations.” Elsewhere, Toast Interactive's VR platformer Max Mustard sold better on Sony's headset than Quest in the first two weeks. Some of this can be attributed to the specific audience. Max Mustard likely benefitted fulfilling a genre desire when Astro Bot lacked PS VR2 support, despite Rescue Mission being a PSVR hit, while Into The Radius and Swordsman would suggest PlayStation VR2 owners also prefer more “hardcore” experiences. Even then, one studio behind a more casual game revealed surprising sales. “We have similar numbers on Meta as we do on Steam, but much higher on PlayStation. Given the size of these platforms, it’s unclear to us how this is even possible,” a studio representative said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the increasing struggle with sales on Quest and VR in general, two studios advised they're looking more toward flatscreen gaming. Whether that's for hybrid titles going forward or flatscreen-only wasn't specified, though it's clear these decisions are motivated by financial struggles. “Compared to non-VR sales, it is increasingly feeling like we shouldn't bother with VR or MR at all,” one studio tells me, stating sales for their game's flatscreen edition on Steam outperforms the VR edition on Quest by 500%. “In my opinion, the Quest Store is not on a good path. As a result, we will see a good amount of VR studios close or pivot to non-VR in the next years, leading to a big drop in quality games 2-3 years down the line,” said one developer. A couple of developers expected layoffs and closures from many that don't pivot to flatscreen titles. With PowerWash Simulator VR support being officially dropped, other studios evidently aren't finding Quest profitable, though FuturLab's port faced criticisms at launch. Crucially, this avoided layoffs and saw the staff members redeployed to other projects. Eiche described this as a “smart business decision” because FuturLab didn’t wait until layoffs became inevitable. The last two years for many VR studios have been rough. The wider games industry remains in a rough state, tens of thousands of developers have lost their jobs and VR gaming has been hit too. WIMO Games, Archiact, First Contact Entertainment, Sony's London Studio, and Ready At Dawn have all shut down since 2023. Other big names hit by layoffs include nDreams, Lode, TinyBuild, Codemasters, VRChat, Soul Assembly, XR Games, Toast Interactive, Resolution Games, Firesprite, Humble Games, Supermassive Games, Downpour Interactive and, most recently, Fast Travel Games. We've received emails from folks looking for contract positions as some studio heads look to “work for hire” jobs to keep their workers employed. “I can still get by because I'm solo, but if I had employees there would be no way this would be sustainable,” one developer said. Some developers also highlighted their worries about Meta's recent changes to its content moderation policies across Threads, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, which includes removing fact-checking. These recent moves saw CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused of aligning himself with President Trump before his inauguration last month. Meta faced heavy criticism both from platform users and its own staff over its updated community standards guidelines, with many worried about the rise of hate speech, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia, and more. Meta also removed transgender and non-binary themes from Messenger, killed its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and removed accommodations for transgender staff. The current Hateful Conduct guidelines as of February 4, 2025, state the following: “We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality.” Meta Quest and Horizon Worlds use a separate Code of Conduct for Virtual Experiences. Meta defines “hate-based organizations” in another policy at the company, with a page noting “we cannot estimate prevalence for organized hate right now.” Meta's moderation landscape is changing rapidly, and its efforts to scale toward billions of users continues to bend heavily toward automated systems at multiple layers. Evidence recently emerged via VR enthusiast Lunayian that Meta could be dropping moderators reviewing the last few mins of audio/video after you report other users in Horizon Worlds. One developer questioned how much longer they can ethically do business with such an organization. We intend to explore this particular area further fully in a separate report. If you have information to share with us, or in particular a developer looking to share your thoughts on Meta's recent moderation changes, please use our Contact Us page to get in touch or email me: hstockdale@uploadvr.com. Where does this leave the VR market? If you're a VR gamer, some months may seem like there are more older games getting VR mods than new VR games. Even so, there's still a slow but steady drip of indie releases from small teams, as well as occasional tentpoles from well-funded groups with dozens of artists working on a single project. Some developers are hopeful things will change for the better at Meta, while others cannot wait for Valve's rumored Deckard headset. Many praised Meta for keeping the VR market as vibrant as it has been, though another conceded VR adoption has been “slower than expected.” Another criticized the infrastructure around the platform as “suffering from serious growing pains.” One developer believes Meta is shaping the industry in an “unsustainable” direction that’s good for retention from younger audiences – free-to-play – but bad for overall revenue. Others cited concerns about the market shifting so rapidly, while one expressed caution about chasing mixed reality experiences at the expense of VR. One studio cited shifting goalposts during development on Quest as a problem, while another believes mixed reality made some developers “forget about VR.” Clear investments are being made into pushing Horizon Worlds and that's particularly true on mobile, though some remain hopeful that Meta can be persuaded into course correction. In preparation for this article, we reached out to Meta this week with a bulleted list of complaints from developers and questions we're hoping the company can answer. We were told they're preparing a blog post and will update with a link to that post once it is live. As part of our reporting, UploadVR initially put a call-out for responses to a consumer survey. However, this did not receive a wide enough response to be considered viable data for the report. For transparency, we've included a link to the full results here.

Title: Here’s What Happened After Elon Musk Cut 80% Of X’s Employees—As He Eyes Reshaping Federal Workforce
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/02/05/heres-what-happened-after-elon-musk-cut-80-of-xs-employees-as-he-eyes-reshaping-federal-workforce/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:14:59Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s campaign to get rid of 10% of the U.S.’ 2.3 million-strong federal workforce, including all 10,000 employees in the U.S. Agency for International Development, has little historic precedent, but it does evoke memories of the world’s richest man’s 2022 takeover of social media company Twitter, now known as X. Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and quickly slashed its headcount. Just six months after closing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Musk told the BBC he culled the company’s headcount to 1,500, down about 80% from 7,500 employees as of the end of 2021, as noted in the company’s last annual report as a public company. The dramatic restructuring came as a result of firings and voluntary resignation packages as the social media company pivoted to Musk’s “extremely hardcore” culture, laid out in an all-hands email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road.” That’s the same subject line all federal employees got last week in their email offering voluntary buyouts, an offer about 20,000—or 1%—of workers have taken thus far, while Musk and his allies have orchestrated the administrative leave of almost all USAID employees. The social media company initially took a massive financial hit as its workforce shrank. Its advertising revenue in 2023, Musk’s first full year at the helm of X, declined to a reported $2.5 billion, a more than 45% decrease from Twitter’s ad sales in 2021, its final full year as a public company, causing Fidelity to write down its valuation of X to as little as $9 billion by last September, just a fifth of the sticker price Musk paid two years prior. After Musk’s takeover, the company overhauled its operations, cutting its content moderation and communications teams, and reshaped its platform, focusing on premium monthly subscriptions and algorithm-based feeds like TikTok’s. To a degree, yes. In recent months, X has begun to show signs of recovery. Fidelity upped its X valuation to about $13 billion in December and several major advertisers, including Amazon, are renewing their presence on the platform. X’s financials recovered in 2024 on its leaner model, as Bloomberg reports X brought in $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings last year, within striking distance of 2021’s $1.4 billion, with a much leaner staff. X’s recent rebound traces back to Musk’s chummy relationship with President Donald Trump, but Musk’s activities outside of his corporate role are a big part of why the company landed in hot water in the first place. Major companies like Disney and Apple paused ads on X in late 2023 after Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, while others balked at the lack of content guardrails on the site. Very. The Musk-led push to trim 6,000 positions at X, a much smaller scale than the government job cuts he hopes to oversee, brought significant legal challenges from employees—including more than 2,000 arbitration cases, after X did not pay the severance package Musk promised, and several broader lawsuits. The fate of those lawsuits has been mixed: A federal judge tossed one lawsuit accusing him of skimping on a half-billion in severance payments, while another severance-based suit was allowed to proceed in part. Musk is taking “the same Twitter playbook now with the federal government," Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney representing many of the former Twitter/X employees in arbitration against their former employer, told NPR. "And he couldn't even come up with a new subject line for the email,” Liss-Riordan continued. In the latest signal of institutional confidence in X, banks which helped finance Musk’s 2022 acquisition plan to sell $5.5 billion of X’s debt at 97 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Government agencies do not have a similar catch-all performance metric as corporations do with the yardstick of profit, but Musk’s private sector resume shows clear evidence of operational efficiency leadership. Tesla, Musk’s most valuable company and the primary source of his wealth, grew to be an investor favorite due to its high profit margins compared to other car companies, made possible in part by its relatively lean headcount. Tesla had 141,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2023, compared to Ford’s 177,000 and General Motors’ 163,000, according to the company’s most recent proxy statements. And yet Tesla brought in $10.9 billion in net income in 2023, besting Ford’s $8.1 billion net profit and General Motors’ $10.5 billion despite the legacy automakers’ higher headcount. Musk is worth $400 billion, according to Forbes' calculations, making him the world's richest person by a roughly $150 billion margin. X accounted for less than $7 billion of his fortune as of November. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Report: Amazon Employees Say Restructuring Leaves Fewer Opportunities to Advance
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/report-amazon-employees-say-restructuring-leaves-fewer-opportunities-to-advance/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T21:11:01Z

Amazon’s efforts to restructure its workforce have reportedly left staffers with fewer opportunities to move up the corporate ladder. These concerns result from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to reduce the company’s middle management ranks and free up funds for its investments in data centers and artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Feb. 5). To reduce costs, the company’s organizations have been told to hire recent college graduates, find reasons to remove more senior workers, and have fewer managers as compared to front-line workers, according to the report. Most employees interviewed by Bloomberg said Amazon had become a less desirable place to work, per the report. Together with the reduction in the number of opportunities to advance their careers, some cited the company’s cutbacks on projects like cashierless checking and telehealth and its requirement to return to the office five days a week. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Bloomberg, per the report, that the reduction in the number of managers “impacts a relatively small subset of employees and aims to increase our team members’ ability to move fast, clarify and strengthen their sense of ownership, and drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most affects customers and the business. Each organization is determining the best way to reach this goal, and our internal surveys show that employee sentiment remains strong.” Jassy wrote in a message shared with Amazon’s employees and posted online in September that the company planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In the case of managers, Jassy said Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Amazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the event will include news from its Alexa team. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, will also be in attendance, according to invites sent to media. Amazon has been racing to release a new version of its voice-activated Alexa software that has more advanced artificial intelligence capabilities. It is responding to increased competition in generative AI from rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, as well as Claude, the chatbot created by AI startup Anthropic, which has raised billions of dollars from Amazon and other investors. Amazon executives have scheduled a "Go/No-go" meeting for Feb. 14 in preparation for releasing the souped-up Alexa to the public, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The company first previewed a redesigned Alexa in 2023, showing off a live conversation between an Amazon executive and the voice assistant as part of a yet-to-be-released feature called Let's Chat. Amazon shared few details following that event about further Alexa updates, and it did not hold its typical fall event in 2024, at which it typically announces new products. CNBC reported last year that Amazon was preparing to revamp Alexa with AI features, and that it would charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology. In October, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told investors the new Alexa could launch "in the near future," adding that the company is working to "rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models." Jassy has been on a campaign to cut costs across Amazon since late 2022, and the company's devices and services unit, which includes Alexa, has been hit by several rounds of layoffs. Since its launch in 2014, Alexa has not shaped up to be the money maker Amazon anticipated. While hundreds of millions of customers have Alexa-enabled devices in their homes, Amazon has struggled to monetize the products. The company has traditionally launched devices at extremely cheap prices with the goal of promoting its other products and services. That idea has not been as successful as Amazon hoped, and the company has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices business, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Title: The Smartest Investment: How ‘Quality Jobs’ Drive Profits
URL: https://observer.com/2025/02/why-quality-jobs-drive-profits-and-boost-the-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T12:00:35Z

The American workplace is in crisis. In 2024, Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace Report quantified what everyone already knew: 33 percent of U.S. workers are “engaged,” 51 percent are “not engaged,” and 16 percent are “actively disengaged.” Looking only at those numbers, you’d be forgiven for wondering whether there was some sort of collective, corporate effort to make Americans hate what they do for a living. As Charlie Munger famously said, “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Across centuries, political divides and academic disciplines, one idea remains clear: quality jobs are the foundation of thriving markets, strong economies and healthy societies. Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, emphasized in The Theory of Moral Sentiments that markets require moral foundations. More recently, MIT professor Zeynep Ton reinforced this principle, showing that companies with strong job quality strategies see 30-40 percent lower turnover, 20-30 percent higher productivity and 15 to 25 percent higher customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, in What Happened to Capitalism?, Oren Cass points to a stark reality: over the past 50 years, corporate profits have soared 185 percent, while wages have grown just 1 percent. A “quality job” encompasses several key attributes that collectively enhance the well-being and satisfaction of employees. These positions offer fair compensation, ensuring that workers receive wages commensurate with their skills and experience. Beyond monetary rewards, quality jobs provide comprehensive benefits packages, including health insurance and retirement plans, which contribute to long-term financial security. Such roles also offer opportunities for professional growth through training and development programs, enabling employees to advance their careers. Moreover, quality jobs foster a positive work environment characterized by respect, inclusivity and a healthy work-life balance, ensuring employees feel valued and supported. Collectively, these elements improve individual job satisfaction and enhance overall productivity and organizational commitment. The increasingly stark contrast between profits and wages has led to growing calls for change. In 2019, the Business Roundtable made history when 181 CEOs renounced shareholder primacy and embraced stakeholder capitalism. They committed to investing in employees through fair compensation, benefits, training and workplace dignity. Johnson & Johnson pioneered this stakeholder approach with their 1943 credo, explicitly recognizing responsibilities to employees before shareholders as a precondition to generating sustainable profits. For many, the results speak for themselves: Costco (COST) pays its workers an average of $25 per hour with 13 percent turnover versus the industry’s 60 percent. Southwest Airlines introduced its profit-sharing program in 1974 and boasts a 4 percent employee turnover rate. Nucor Steel maintains a no-layoffs policy through downturns and shares profits directly with workers; in 2023, this translated to almost $1 billion in profit sharing for the company’s nearly 31,000 employees. Others offer cautionary tales. In 2019, McDonald’s announced it would no longer lobby against raising workers’ pay, indicating previous resistance to wage increases. Despite this shift, the company has faced challenges in attracting workers, leading to wage increases in 2021 to address a “challenging hiring environment.” And though Amazon promised better worker treatment, union battles, high injury rates and reports of worker surveillance were just a few of the headlines that made issues for Jeff Bezos last year. Of course, Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald’s remain highly successful, profitable and growing companies. But imagine how much more impactful they could be—both economically and reputationally—if they fully embraced the commitments they made in 2019. Their influence is undeniable; the question is whether they’ll use it to set a new standard or simply maintain the status quo. Investing in quality jobs isn’t just an honorable choice—it’s a financial one. Higher wages, predictable schedules and training programs reduce turnover, cut recruitment costs and boost output. Southwest Airlines, Nucor and Costco aren’t simply doing the right thing; they’re outcompeting their peers because of it. I coined the term “Patriotic Capitalism” to refer to the notion of an economic and investment framework that prioritizes country, democracy and the common good as the way forward for national prosperity. This framework aligns with the vision of an economy where people can contribute productively to their communities, support their families and raise children prepared to do the same. Beyond ethics, it’s essential for national competitiveness in a world where human capital determines success. In addition to policy changes, attitude shifts across C-suites and boards are necessary. Superior operational design and a focus on human capital investment can generate enhanced and sustainable financial returns. Research conducted by a global private equity firm found that companies whose senior management had the highest levels of empathy generated the highest financial returns. Authentic empathy engages workers; engaged workers drive innovation, productivity and profitability. Quality jobs go beyond fair pay—they lay the foundation for innovation and productive investment. The framework is straightforward, comprising common-sense elements like broad-based employee ownership, fair compensation, predictable schedules and meaningful training. The evidence is clear: quality jobs strengthen companies, build resilient communities and enhance national competitiveness. Businesses that embrace this approach aren’t just doing good; they’re gaining a sustainable competitive edge. The choice isn’t between profitability and good jobs—that’s a false dichotomy that both Adam Smith and modern research debunk. Yes, raising wages and offering ownership requires an upfront investment—but high turnover, low morale and worker disengagement already cost U.S. businesses billions annually. Paying employees better isn’t charity; it’s a calculated business strategy that leads to higher productivity, stronger brand loyalty, and better long-term returns. Quality jobs are the smartest investment a company can make in its future. And in today’s global economy, they might be the smartest investment America can make in its future, too.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: Turmoil as ADM trims 700 jobs, Salesforce slashes 1,000 after Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon axe

Significant layoffs continue to sweep across major big tech and corporate firms in 2025. Following similar decisions by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Salesforce have joined the expanding list of industry titans trimming their staff. According to Reuters, ADM, a major international grain trader, announced plans to cut up to 700 jobs to reduce expenses by $500 million to $750 million over the next three to five years. Juan Luciano, the company's CEO, stated that "softer market conditions and policy uncertainty" were the main reasons for these layoffs. The action comes as ADM adapts to a shifting global market environment, with difficulties expected in the upcoming year. According to a Bloomberg News report, Salesforce plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees while simultaneously hiring new ones to promote the sales of its new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The story (quoting a source familiar with the matter) said the displaced workers could apply for other roles within the organisation. However, it is yet unknown how the layoffs will impact particular divisions. The announcements follow similar moves by Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, which also implemented widespread layoffs in reaction to market instability, industry changes, and economic challenges. Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, resulting in the affected employees losing their jobs with immediate effect and without any severance pay. Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, is laying off about 3,600 people, or 5% of its staff, according to a Bloomberg report that cited an internal memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Employees impacted will be informed by February 10. In the memo, Zuckerberg wrote, “I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.” According to reports, Amazon intends to make significant layoffs, possibly removing up to 14,000 administrative positions by the beginning of 2025. According to data from a Morgan Stanley paper referenced in news sources, this action is expected to result in significant cost savings of about $3 billion annually. Meanwhile, according to Business Insider, the company is letting go of about 200 workers in the US in its ‘Fashion and Fitness’ division.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed China's instant retaliation to US President Donald Trump's additional tariffs and the potential risks of a trade war. Traders also took in fresh jobs data, with job openings declining more than expected in December. Investors are continuing to watch any signs of cooling in the labor market as the Federal Reserve debates future interest rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Beijing reacted swiftly on Tuesday to Trump's additional 10% levies on Chinese imports going into effect at midnight. China slapped tariffs of 15% on US coal and liquified natural gas, starting Feb. 10, alongside 10% duties on imports of crude oil, farm equipment, and some autos. The tit-for-tat measures raise the risk of an escalation into trade war that would damage both of the world's top two economies. But some on Wall Street see the Chinese response as showing restraint that opens the door to compromise, as seen in the US tariff postponement deals with Mexico and Canada. Giving more cause for optimism, Trump brought forward talks with China's President Xi Jinping. He said on Monday they would take place "probably over the next 24 hours," rather than later in the week. The pair did not speak on Tuesday but US officials said a call could come tomorrow. The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) fell, down about 0.9% as worries eased somewhat. Meanwhile, China opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and added Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH) and biotech company Illumina (ILMN) to its "unreliable entities list." Outside of China's investigation, investors also kept a close eye on Alphabet's earnings, with the company the latest Mag 7 name to report. Shares dropped around 7% in after-hours trading after revenue for its all-important cloud business disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Other high-profile companies also posted results after the bell. Chipotle stock fell on a same-store sales miss while shares of AMD (AMD) rose on strong guidance that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) saw its stock jump double digits after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw shares rise in after-hours trading after the company posted a strong sales forecast that eased concerns about an AI chip slowdown. In the current quarter, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That view tops the midpoint of Wall Street estimates. "Looking into 2025, we see clear opportunities for continued growth based on the strength of our product portfolio and growing demand for high-performance and adaptive computing," the company said in the earnings release. Here are AMD's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Read more about AMD's earnings from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley here. Snap (SNAP) shares soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company beat on both the top and bottom lines and guided to first quarter revenue that was ahead of expectations. Snap said it expects revenue in the current quarter to come in between $1.33 billion and $1.36 billion. That's ahead of the $1.33 billion Wall Street had anticipated. The company also sees daily active users reaching about 459 million, also ahead of the expected 458 million. Here are Snap's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Chipotle (CMG) stock fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading before paring losses after the company reported comparable sales that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. For the fourth quarter, the fast-casual restaurant chain reported comparable sales up 5.4%, below Wall Street's estimates of a 5.67% increase. Chipotle's operating margin of 14.6% also fell short of Wall Street's estimate of 15.1%. The company's earnings per share of $0.25 matched Wall Street's projections. Read more on Chipotle's results from Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dropped over 7% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after overall revenue missed expectations in the quarter. Revenue for its all-important cloud business also disappointed, while spending came in ahead of expectations. Here are Alphabet's top- and bottom-line results, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates: The company reported cloud revenue of $11.96 billion, a miss compared to Bloomberg consensus expectations of $12.19 billion. Read more about Alphabet's results from Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. US stocks closed higher on Tuesday, led by Big Tech, as investors assessed the latest trade war developments and fresh jobs data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 1.4% to recoup some of Monday's losses. Disney (DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday as the company aims to extend recent streaming momentum and build on its latest string of theatrical hits at the box office. Parks should face some uncertainty after Disney estimated in November that Hurricanes Helene and Milton would register a hit of about $130 million in the quarter, while the Disney cruise line pre-launches will tack on an additional $90 million. Still, the company said operating income at the parks will improve beyond the first quarter, estimating growth between 6% and 8% for full-year 2025. Here's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Streaming profitability should once again be a focus point after Disney said it expects its direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business — which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — to post profits of approximately $875 million in fiscal 2025. In its latest results, the company reported profits of $321 million for the three months ending Sept. 28. Read more here. Job openings declined more than analysts expected in December, hitting 7.6 million, their lowest level since September. But economists argued the details in the release were roughly in line with the "broadly stable" labor market Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described in his most recent press conference on Jan. 29. "The totality of the December JOLTS data are consistent with a labour market that has stabilized at a healthy level," Capital Economics North America economist Paul Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. This dynamic can be seen in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. The ratio has been sitting at around 1 to 1 for more than six months now, reflecting significant cooling from the hot labor market of 2022 but still painting a relatively solid jobs picture. For now, this helps paint a "familiar picture" of the labor market, according to Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten. It's an environment where hiring has clearly slowed, but layoffs aren't rampant and pushing unemployment higher. "The December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed's view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy," Vanden Houten wrote. "We will be removing a March rate cut from our February baseline forecast." Robinhood (HOOD) shares held on to earlier gains, rising about 2% Tuesday despite the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formally requesting the company "not permit customers to access" sports event contracts. The development comes just one day after Robinhood said it would launch event contracts for Super Bowl LIX, a move that would have allowed users to place bets on who will win the game: the Kansas City Chiefs or the Philadelphia Eagles. The event contracts began trading on Monday, but have since been suspended, according to the company. "We are disappointed by this outcome, especially given that we had been in regular communication with the CFTC about our intent and plans to offer this product," Robinhood said in a statement. "We’ve also taken steps to advocate for balanced regulation in the futures and derivatives markets, including participating directly in a CFTC roundtable, providing written feedback to the CFTC, and generally championing the economic benefits of event contracts." Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi has more on the story here. Fox (FOXA) is about to enter the competitive streaming marketplace with its own direct-to-consumer service, expected to launch by the end of this year. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch made the announcement during the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Tuesday, saying that while the traditional cable bundle still presents "the most value" for both Fox's customers and its business, "we do want to reach consumers wherever they are. Analysts have said Fox's assets have been heavily skewed toward the linear pay TV ecosystem at a time when more consumers are cutting the cable cord in favor of less expensive streaming services. To that point, Murdoch said the new service will target the "cord-cutters" and the "cord-nevers." The company plans to release more details regarding the launch in the coming months. Traditional legacy players have tried to adapt to the industry's streaming transition. Along with Fox, CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) recently unveiled plans to invest $70 million into a "digital revamp" of its network, which also includes its own direct-to-consumer streaming product. Fox's management had hinted at plans to explore more streaming options. The new service it just announced comes after the abrupt dismantlement of Venu Sports, a sports streaming service that was supposed to launch from Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney's ESPN (DIS). Read more here. It's already a different trade war from Trump's first run in the White House. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: After announcing historic duties on America's top three trading partners over the weekend, Trump then shocked markets again on Monday with a quick pivot on two of them. As of Tuesday morning, 10% duties on China are in place, and the world's second-largest economy has already hit back. The 25% duties on Canada and Mexico are on hold for a month as talks continue. At a Politico event on Tuesday morning, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping will take place today and that a tariff pause will be on the table. The unpredictable mix is clearly flummoxing Wall Street and the rest of corporate America. "It is fundamentally different," former US trade representative general counsel Greta Peisch said in an interview, noting that Trump is now "breaking new ground in what is a trade authority, what are they used for, and how expensive the transactions will be."

Kennedy Jr. cleared a key committee vote in his quest to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy's nomination now heads to the Senate, which is widely expected to approve his nomination. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La), a medical doctor, had been a key swing vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The senator confirmed his decision in a post on X, writing, "With the serious commitments I’ve received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on, like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes." The final tally was 14-13, with every Republican voting in favor of Kennedy's nomination. Every Democrat on the committee voted against it. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining around 1% in early afternoon trading. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) jumped nearly 2% to reach intraday record highs — its third intraday record of 2025. Shares are also currently on track for another record close. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose, while AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 2% in early trading as it attempted to stage a comeback from previous session losses of over 2.5%. Palantir (PLTR) was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance early Tuesday after the intelligence software company's quarterly and annual revenue forecasts exceeded expectations. Shares rocketed roughly 25% to a fresh record high. Investors applauded solid demand for the company's artificial intelligence products, which included higher US commercial and government sales in the quarter. Late last year, the company secured a $400 million contract with the Army for up to four years. Palantir has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, with shares up nearly 1,000% over the past five years. Still, its hefty market cap of over $239 billion has long been questioned by analysts. On the earnings call, the company addressed DeepSeek concerns following last week's sell-off. "We would strongly discourage [DeepSeek] and don't think any customer in the US government will be able to use it," said Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer. Oil pared losses after sliding as much as 3% following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs on some US imports, including oil and liquified natural gas. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) recovered to trade near $72.80 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also cut losses of more than 2% to trade around $76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, crude reacted to China's announcement that starting next Monday, it would impose levies of 15% on US-imported coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) and 10% for crude oil. This came in retaliation to the Trump administration's implementation of additional 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports on Tuesday. On Monday, President Trump paused tariffs against Mexican and Canadian imports, which would've included oil. Job openings declined more than expected in December as investors continue to watch closely for any signs of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed there were 7.6 million jobs open at the end of December, a decrease from the 8.15 million seen in November. The November figure was revised higher from the 8.01 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 8 million openings in November. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.46 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.37 million made during November. The hiring rate was flat at 3.4% for the third straight month. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, was 2% in December, unchanged from the month prior. US stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as investors continued to assess back-and-forth tariff developments, with China responding to President Trump's 10% tariffs with its own duties on US goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down roughly 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened just around the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a losing day for stocks. Google is facing a new antitrust probe in China as Beijing responds to Trump's "first salvo" of tariffs with a warning shot showing where it thinks it can hit the US hard. But shares in Google owner Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) inched higher in pre-market, rising almost 1%, even as Big Tech eyes a potential hit from Trump's tariffs itself. Investors may well be holding fire for the megacap tech's fourth quarter results, due after the bell, to get a steer on whether its massive AI spending is about to pay off. China has already brought one challenge to Alphabet in the shape of Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI models. At the same time, some on Wall Street see the Google parent as more insulated than its peers from tariff risk, given its cloud and ad strength stand to offset AI stumbles. Though there is a chance that the market is underpricing tariff risk — or is just baffled as to what Trump will do next, as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports. Shares of Spotify (SPOT) climbed over 9% before the bell on the heels of upbeat quarterly results. The stock has already surged roughly 150% over the past year, as of Monday's close. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Spotify Technology posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat revenue expectations, as it reported its first full-year profit. The audio giant also posted another strong quarter of subscriber gains, as levels of churn remain low despite recent price increases. The results follow an intense business overhaul, which has included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts — an area it had aggressively pursued. Those efforts allowed the stock to stage a comeback from the record lows it faced in 2022. Read more here. Europe's stock markets trod water on Tuesday, as investors eyed the US-China exchange of tariff fire for clues to what duties Trump might hit the EU with. The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) wavered below the flat line as a series of corporate earnings shifted the mood. Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) retraced deeper morning losses to trade little changed, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris was more upbeat, with a 0.3% gain. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) in London trended lower. Overall, I'm not liking these earnings from PepsiCo. The food giant's 2025 sales and EPS guidance were relatively in line with consensus. The Street may have some concern about the company hitting those targets, judging by how the fourth quarter played out. Pressure was on the top and bottom lines in the company's two most important segments: Frito Lay and North America beverages. PepsiCo continues to see heightened competition in its categories and low-income consumers spending cautiously, given years of price increases. Its shares are off by 2.5% in the pre-market. I am talking to PepsiCo (PEP) chair and CEO Ramon Laguarta ahead of his earnings call today at around 7:45 a.m. ET, so I will jump back in here with more insights. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Estée Lauder Laments ‘Lost Agility’ and Cuts up to 7K Jobs

Consumer pullback around the world is leading Estée Lauder to cut thousands of jobs. The beauty brand released earnings Tuesday (Feb. 4) showing declining or flat sales in its markets around the globe, especially in Asia, where sales fell by double digits. Speaking to analysts during an earnings call, CEO Stéphane de La Faverie discussed some of the factors that have hurt the company’s performance in recent years, including “subdued” consumer sentiment in China and a “narrow focus” on too few markets. “This was especially true in North America. Simply said we lost our agility,” de La Faverie said. “We did not capitalize on the higher growth opportunities quickly enough. In channels, markets, media and prestige price tiers nor fuel new consumer acquisition aggressively enough.” To that end, the company is embarking on a turnaround campaign that involves the elimination of 5,800 to 7,000 jobs, though that number takes into account reductions of employees after retraining and redeployment of some workers. Estée Lauder says it also plans to expand its presence in certain channels and markets to take part in “key growth opportunities in prestige beauty” while also boosting consumer-facing investments by increasing ad spending. “We know we didn’t make fast move in terms of new distribution when the consumer was moving,” de La Faverie added. “That’s what we’ve demonstrated with the move that we’ve made a few months ago with Amazon and many of us like TikTok Shop in Asia and even in the U.S. So we’re going to really measure how quickly we move in this channel and how much we can like to capture lapsed consumers but also new consumers.” The company also recently teamed with OpenAI recently to implement artificial intelligence (AI) across its brands. The companies developed 240 AI applications to analyze consumer data and create products for its various brands. “The facility processes data from consumer surveys and clinical trials for the company’s beauty brands,” that report said. “Two primary applications have emerged from the development process: one analyzes consumer survey data for fragrance development, while another processes clinical trial results.” As PYMNTS wrote at the time, other beauty companies are also investing in AI for consumer-facing and product development. For example, L’Oréal expanded its use of Modiface, an AI and augmented reality platform that allows users to virtually try on makeup and experiment with hair colors. And Sephora’s Virtual Artist tool lets customers find their ideal foundation shade using facial recognition and a skin tone database, improving accuracy and inclusivity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The Federation of National Trade Unions, known as CSN, said Tuesday it plans to petition a court to order Amazon to reopen seven warehouses and restore the 1,700 jobs lost as a result of the closures. Amazon announced in late January it would phase out seven sites in Quebec "following a recent review" of its operations in the province, which is the only location in Canada with unionized Amazon employees. The company said it would return to a third-party delivery model, enlisting subcontractors to handle deliveries. The CSN estimated that roughly 4,500 jobs were cut by Amazon and its subcontractors as a result of the closures. "Amazon thinks it can just shift the work to other corporate entities and outsource some warehousing and delivery operations," CSN President Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "What it calls the 'new business model' is just an attempt to circumvent its obligations under the Labour Code. The court should recognize that this scheme violates the law and it can then order the reinstatement of Amazon's workers." Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said reverting to a third-party delivery model, which it used in Quebec before 2020, will allow the company to "provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run." "In making this decision, we've complied and will continue to comply with all the applicable federal and provincial laws," Agrait said in a statement. The CSN represents roughly 240 Amazon workers at a warehouse near the Montreal suburb of Laval. Workers at the site unionized last May, becoming the first Amazon warehouse in Canada to do so. Following the closures, Canada's industry minister, Francoise-Philippe Champagne, wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressing his "disappointment" over the decision, saying it "raises questions about your commitment to Canada and your Canadian partners." Champagne said the government would consider conducting a review of its current deals with Amazon. Amazon said the vice president of its Canada business spoke with Champagne after the company announced the closures. The company also faces growing labor pressure in the U.S. Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are slated to vote next week on whether to join a union, while Whole Foods workers in Philadelphia voted Jan. 27 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Amazon employees at a facility in Staten Island, New York, in 2022 formed the company's first union at a U.S. warehouse, though they have yet to secure a contract. The group voted to affiliate with the Teamsters in June. WATCH: Tariffs' toll on e-commerce Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Tech layoffs this year: A timeline

Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:40:51Z

2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies. Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. As it moves to invest more in AI and international growth, Workday is laying off 8.5% of its workforce and disposing of unused office space. Some analysts fear the cutbacks will affect the company’s customer service — unless AI can pick up the slack. At the same time as it’s hiring sales staff for its new artificial intelligence products, Salesforce is laying off over 1,000 workers across the company, according to Bloomberg. As of June, 2024, the company had over 72,000 employees, according to its website. Salesforce did not comment on the report. In 2024 the company reportedly laid off around 1,000 staff too, in two waves: January and July. Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees he intended to “move out the low performers faster” in an internal memo reported by Bloomberg. The memo announced that the company will lay off 5% of its staff, or around 3,600 staff, beginning Feb. 10. The company had already reduced its headcount by 5% in 2024 through natural attrition, the memo said. Among those leaving the company will be staff previously responsible for fact checking of posts on its social media platforms in the US, as the company begins relying on its users to police content. Despite intense demand for its data center capacity, Equinix is planning to lay off 3% of its workforce, or around 400 employees. The announcement followed the appointment of Adaire Fox-Martin to replace Charles Meyers as CEO and the departures of two other senior executives, CIO Milind Wagle and CISO Michael Montoya. AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce. After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies. Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.” OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said. Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving. Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.

After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there were early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continued to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs seen through the year were an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024.

AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications. Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Roughly 8% of Microsoft’s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lion’s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition. German enterprise software giant SAP said this week that 8,000 jobs will be “impacted” by a large-scale shift in company priorities towards generative artificial intelligence (genAI). It’s unclear how many of the affected employees will be laid off, as the company has said many of the impacts will involve “voluntary leave programs and internal re-skilling measures.” SAP said the restructuring will not result in an overall loss of headcount. The company cut more than 3,000 jobs in 2023. Analysts expect the move to skew SAP’s workforce younger and more expert in genAI. Online retailer eBay plans to cut nearly 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 jobs—saying “in an official blog post that “headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business.” All of the company’s US workforce was told to work from home Wednesday as the firings were carried out via Zoom. Additionally, eBay said it would “scale back” on its work with outside contractors in a further attempt to rein in costs. The company fired 500 workers last year after sales slackened in the wake of the pandemic boom, according to NPR. Google’s ad sales team lost several hundred staff from its large customer department, part of the company’s move to automate some jobs with machine learning. Reports suggest that more staffers from the ad sales team were also let go in October 2023. The company also laid off hundreds more employees from its digital voice assistant, Fitbit, and Pixel teams earlier in the week. Google has been steadily shedding jobs since January 2023, when parent company Alphabet downsized its entire workforce by 6% across the board, putting 12,000 people out of work. Alphabet announced that it is laying off hundreds of employees from several teams, including engineering and the teams responsible for its digital voice assistant and hardware products, including Fitbit wearable devices and Pixel smartphones. The reorganization of the hardware teams will see a consolidation of different teams responsible for different devices, such as Nest, Pixel, and Fitbit, combined under a single team, which will be responsible for all devices, the news portal reported, adding that the activity has also seen the departure of Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman.

Title: Salesforce Reportedly Cuts 1,000 Jobs While Adding AI Salespeople

Salesforce is reportedly eliminating over 1,000 jobs while hiring staff to sell its artificial intelligence products. Workers who are displaced will be able to apply for other roles within the company, Bloomberg reported Monday (Feb. 3), citing unnamed sources. It wasn’t clear which divisions were affected by the layoffs, the report said. Salesforce, a provider of customer management software, had nearly 73,000 employees as of January 2024, when its previous fiscal year closed. Salesforce did not respond to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Tech companies have gotten used to routine job cuts following a surge of layoffs in early 2023, according to the report. Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all announced cuts so far this year. Meanwhile, Salesforce has been hiring people for its new AI agent products, while also focusing on shoring up profit margins following pressure from activist investors in 2023, the report said. “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,” Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said when asked about the company’s profit focus in December, per the report. “We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?’” Last month, Salesforce debuted a point-of-sale (POS) operating system built on generative AI. “We’re not here to complement the status quo — we’re here to replace it,” Salesforce Senior Vice President and General Manager for Retail Nitin Mangtani told PYMNTS after the launch. “Retailers need technology that doesn’t just power transactions but transforms the entire shopping experience from discovery to checkout. That’s what this GenAI-powered POS is built to do.” Businesses must respect today’s fluid consumer journeys, which cover both physical and digital touchpoints, he said. For example, a consumer might happen upon a product while watching a TikTok video, buy it online, and exchange it in-store. “Unified commerce is not just a buzzword,” Mangtani said. “It’s table stakes. The consumer journey today is so intertwined that attributing success to one channel is nearly impossible.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Leftist Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Slashes Jobs to Prepare for AI Takeover

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a notorious leftist, is cutting over 1,000 jobs as the company’s new fiscal year begins, even as it ramps up hiring for AI-focused sales positions. Bloomberg reports that San Francisco-based Salesforce has announced it will be eliminating more than 1,000 roles as part of a restructuring effort coinciding with the start of its new fiscal year. The job cuts come despite the company simultaneously embarking on a hiring spree for salespeople specializing in its new AI agent products. According to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the private nature of the information, the affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific divisions impacted by the layoffs have not been disclosed. As of January 2024, Salesforce boasted a workforce of nearly 73,000 employees. The move by Salesforce reflects a growing trend among technology companies to implement regular job reductions, following a significant wave of layoffs that swept the industry in early 2023. This year alone, tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have all taken steps to trim their corporate workforces. While Salesforce is cutting jobs in certain areas, the company is also actively expanding its sales team to promote its new AI agent products. This dual approach highlights the company’s focus on maintaining profitability and efficiency, a priority that has been emphasized since activist investors applied pressure in 2023. In a December event hosted by Barclays Plc, Salesforce’s Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham addressed the company’s commitment to balancing growth and profitability, stating, “Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business. We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?'” Breitbart News previously reported that Salesforce CEO was one of the many Silicon Valley leaders to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump after his stunning election victory in November: The turnabout is particularly striking given the extreme leftist politics of some executives now meeting with or praising Trump. Salesforce CEO and hyperleftist Marc Benioff, who owns Time Magazine, posted on X celebrating “a time of great promise for our nation” after Time named Trump its “Person of the Year.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

Title: Salesforce plans over 1,000 job cuts amid AI hiring push

Salesforce is set to eliminate more than 1,000 positions as it enters its new fiscal year. According to Bloomberg, which broke the story, the job reductions coincide with ongoing hiring efforts to expand the company’s sales team for AI products. A source familiar with the matter told the news agency that affected employees would have the opportunity to apply for other positions within the company. The specific departments impacted by the layoffs were not disclosed. Salesforce previously reported a total workforce of approximately 72,682 employees as of 31 January 2024. The firm has carried out multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year. In January 2024, Salesforce let go 700 of its employees, followed by an additional 300 in July. Despite the reductions, the cloud-based software firm continues to hire for AI-related roles. In particular, Salesforce has expanded its sales team to support Agentforce, an AI-powered virtual representative platform. CEO Marc Benioff announced in December 2024 that Salesforce had secured over 1,000 paid deals for the product, which automates tasks such as responding to customer inquiries and assessing potential sales opportunities. Salesforce’s enterprise cloud portfolio remains a key driver of revenue growth. The company’s data cloud and AI-driven tools, including Agentforce, have seen strong adoption among enterprise clients seeking to streamline workflows and manage large volumes of data. On its most recent earnings call, executives emphasised the role of Agentforce in the company’s strategy. Salesforce has been investing heavily in the platform’s expansion, with plans to hire 1,400 new employees in the fourth quarter to meet growing demand. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, released in December 2024. It reported $9.44bn in revenue for the quarter ending 31 October 2024, an 8% increase from the previous year. Salesforce raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $37.8bn to $38bn, slightly above its prior forecast. Earnings per share (EPS) projections were also revised upward to a range of $6.15 to $6.2. in addition, subscription and support revenue, which represents the bulk of the company’s income, increased by 9% YoY to $8.88bn. Operating cash flow surged 29% YoY to $1.98bn, while free cash flow rose 30% to $1.78bn. Salesforce is set to report fourth-quarter earnings later this month, which may provide further insight into its workforce strategy and AI expansion plans. The restructuring at Salesforce reflects the broader trend throughout the technology sector of companies restructuring their workforces in response to AI-driven changes and shifting business priorities. Over the past year, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all announced job cuts as they focus on emerging technologies and operational efficiencies.
