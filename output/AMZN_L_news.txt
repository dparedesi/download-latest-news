Several colleagues on partner teams were among the roughly 6,000 employees laid off that month. The news made Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, worry that her group would be next. She said it eventually became the "worst-kept secret" that additional layoffs were coming, and that her team was likely to be affected. All she could do was hope to come out unscathed. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." On July 2, her fears were confirmed. Hendersen was one of about 9,000 employees laid off as part of a sweeping companywide reduction. During previous rounds of layoffs she'd survived, Hendersen said it was often hard to tell who had been let go — something the company attributed to privacy concerns. But in her view, that lack of clarity made the experience more difficult for those still at the company, who were left guessing which colleagues had suddenly disappeared. "It's just very uncomfortable, in my experience, to not know who has been affected," she said. So rather than keeping her layoff a secret, she decided to make sure her network knew about it. The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she started drafting messages to share internally and on LinkedIn. That decision didn't just bring emotional support — it also helped her land a new role at Meta two months later. Hendersen is among the thousands of Microsoft employees who've been laid off over the past year. A Microsoft spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. However, the cuts have also affected individual contributors, such as Hendersen. Microsoft isn't alone. Google, Amazon, and Intel have also announced plans to shed workers. While layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a slowdown in white-collar hiring has made it harder for many to secure new roles. But in this challenging environment, some job seekers have found ways to break through. Hendersen shared how she responded to the layoff — and how she landed a job at Meta without ever applying. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Hendersen's journey to a new role began less than an hour after she learned she'd been laid off, when she posted on LinkedIn to share the news. Next, while she still had access to her email, she messaged colleagues on her team, letting them know she'd lost her job — and hoping to identify others affected. As people replied, she added them to a Microsoft Teams group chat. Over the next week, the group of more than a dozen people became a support hub — where laid-off employees traded tips on how to file for unemployment and make sense of the HR materials they'd received. "I would vastly have preferred that I'd have been the only person who was laid off," Hendersen said. "But the fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful." Hendersen also took steps to prepare financially. When she first suspected a layoff might be coming, she and her husband sold some of their stock holdings to ensure they had enough cash on hand. They didn't know exactly what the severance package would look like, so they wanted to be ready. Once the layoff hit, Hendersen learned she'd continue receiving paychecks through late August, followed by a lump-sum severance payment based on her years of service. With that information, she and her husband analyzed their budget, determined how far their savings would take them, and identified expenses they could cut. She said the process was stressful. "There was very much a sense of stunning anxiety," she said. By reaching out to colleagues and preparing financially, Hendersen hoped to make the transition from Microsoft a little smoother. But she wanted to take some time to decompress and get organized before beginning her job search. "It had been 15 years since I'd updated my résumé in any meaningful way," she said. "I didn't have standardized cover letters. I didn't have all the little stories prepared that you're supposed to tell about yourself in interviews." However, Hendersen said she didn't decompress quite as much as she'd intended. After posting on LinkedIn, friends and former colleagues began reaching out about job opportunities, leading to informal conversations about whether they could be a good fit for her. "It was just like this ocean of warm hugs and kindness that came from people who were here to help me," she said. Support also came from the other laid-off Microsoft colleagues she'd organized in a Teams chat. Before losing access to their internal chat, the group transitioned to Discord, where they shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Since Hendersen was finding opportunities through her network, she generally avoided the traditional application route. In total, she thinks she may have formally applied to one role. Relying on her network felt more manageable, especially since, after more than a decade out of the job market, she wasn't sure how to navigate online job searching. Typically, she would share her résumé with a connection, who would then refer her for a role. A recruiter would follow up to begin the process. In some cases, someone would flag an opening, and she'd message the recruiter directly, rather than applying online. One of the roles that was recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. Someone she knew at the company told her about the opening, which was similar to her role at Microsoft, where she'd conducted studies to evaluate how players interacted with games in development. The Meta role was under Reality Labs, the company's hardware and virtual reality division, and allowed her to work from Meta's Seattle office. Hendersen said the position seemed like a good fit, and after her connection referred her, she landed an interview. In late August, she received a job offer and started full-time in October. Hendersen said she came away from her job search with a few takeaways. First, it's important to develop a library of stories from your career that you can use in interviews. "You've done amazing things that people should be really impressed by," she said. "But can you remember them in the moment? That's so hard." She also recommends practicing how to tell those stories, especially to people who aren't in your field. When she interviewed at Meta, not everyone she spoke with came from the gaming world. That meant she had to explain her past work in a way that resonated with interviewers who didn't have the same level of expertise. Perhaps her biggest takeaway was the importance of supporting — and being supported by — others going through the same journey. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time."

Title: Black Women Leaders Found Joy And Reclaimed Their Resilience At The 2025 C-Suite Summit

ByDominique Fluker, Contributor. Black women are experiencing a reckoning. Many of us have found ourselves without a job this year due to mass layoffs, despite our capabilities and accomplishments. Throughout this year, you might’ve come across articles with the headline akin to, “350,000 Black Women Ousted From The Workforce,” highlighting the mass exodus of Black women professionals and documenting where we currently are professionally, despite the despite the grim reality many face. But what hasn’t been as explored are the resources being offered to help keep those who are still in corporate America encouraged, emotionally and spiritually—as many of colleagues, family members and broader community are looking to us for moral support, inspiration, leadership and refuge. Who do we turn to in the face of unprecedented change, confusion and heartache? Is there a soft place to land without judgment and high expectations to perform? That’s where the Martha’s Vineyard African American C-Suite Summit comes into play. Co-founder of Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival, Stephanie Tavares-Rance dreamt up the idea in 2019 to create a safe, tangible space for women occupying the highest levels of leadership. The idea morphed into an anticipated event of the Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in 2021, initially as a C-suite luncheon, and has since expanded to include additional cities like Los Angeles, California, Denver, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia, featuring notable guests and speakers like April Ryan; Zola Mashariki, head of Audible Studios; Latasha Gillespie, global head of diversity, equity and inclusion at Amazon Studios; award-winning actress Uzo Adubo; and ​​Nicole Avant, to name a few. In October 2024, in the C-Suite Series, the experience evolved into a confluence of women leaders at the inaugural C-Suite Summit, which convened in beautiful Beaver Creek, Colorado, for attendees to “Exhale” and embrace wellness, networking, mentorship and inspiration. In all of these spaces, attendees are encouraged to cultivate new relationships and professional possibilities while engaging in provocative and intimate discussions. This year’s summit was aptly named “Resilience,” as multitudes of Black women are finding themselves in a precarious spot regarding their emotional bandwidth, stretching themselves at work by trying to keep their roles by any means necessary, or recovering from a layoff, while also balancing the stressors of their personal lives. Held from October 9 to 12, at the luxurious Park Hyatt Aviara, in Carlsbad, California, a Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rated hotel, the summit, sponsored by Disney, L’Oreal Groupe, Carolina Herrera, Amazon MGM Studios, and ESPN, welcomed C-suite executives, entrepreneurs, A-list actresses, from across the country to convene, participate in transformative workshops, and listen to inspiring fireside chats rooted in reclaiming their resilience, while learning how to expand their professional footprint and deepen their influence and leadership skills. Beyond career strategy, the 2025 C-Suite Summit became a safe space for rest, joy, reflection, and establishing the balance in the face of professional turbulence, intentionally designed that way by Tavares-Rance and her team. From early morning Afro-Soca workouts sponsored by ESPN and hosted by Ariel Belgrave to workshops about how to reclaim resilience and position oneself for power from a health perspective, (both sessions led by chief executive officer Dr. Wizdom Powell and Dr. Kelly Elmore, GME president and OBGYN physician), the topic of the sessions showcased a need to focus on health and wellness, as a means of leverage within the workplace and beyond. Lunch-and-learn and fireside chat conversations with the likes of Vanessa Morrison, president of streaming at Walt Disney Studios, and others also proved meaningful, covering the gamut of aspirational career strategies and taking strategic leaps of faith to move forward in line with your purpose. Professional footprint and leadership skills takeaways from the workshop sessions throughtout the summit highlighted the importance of holistic healing (regulating and tending to your mind, body, and spirit) by doing activities that you once loved to do, actively receiving therapy or working with a life coach to understand previous trauma and address it, exploring ways how to bring your whole self to work, like being vulnerable and open. The sessions also guided attendees on how to regain confidence in themselves and work productively after a layoff or career shift, by encouraging them to be open to pivoting and to lean on authentic communities of support for referrals, advice, and job opportunities. Aside from purposeful discussions, the summit offered fun, joyful experiences such as rejuvenating spa sessions, yoga and an exclusive Amazon MGM screening of Hedda. As an attendee of the summit, I got a sense that Tavares-Rance designed this experience to be a safe space for Black women that went beyond the stuffy workshop sessions you may experience at corporate-based career summits and conferences; instead, she wanted to enrich and empower their spirits, especially after a turbulent and trying year. And she did. “I really believe that Black bodies deserve to be spoiled, and I wanted the summit not just to be entertainment focused, because that’s my background. I feel like as Black women, we’re just so siloed with our industries, but you never know where your next job opportunity, your next friendship, your next board position is going to come from," she tells me. "I wanted to create a space where all women from all over could come together, meet new people, be vulnerable, have a really good time, and spoil themselves with spas, hikes, and walks." Tavares-Rance shared that the goal of this summit was to let Black women know that they aren’t alone, no matter what industry they’re in. “Being a Black woman, we all go through the same challenges, and this space has let you know that you’re not alone and that we're here to help,” she says. While career growth and intentional expansion were at the center of the conference, another vital topic lingered—women’s health and self-care, which are critical to overall success and elevation in and out of the workplace. “I believe women’s health is so important, as well as our mental health. As women, we're just told to stuff down our trauma and put on our armor, go to the office, and be strong. And there's no place for us to be vulnerable. So I wanted to talk about things that matter to us at this summit,” she states. When it comes to this year’s summit title and theme, resilience, Tavares-Rance was clear about the intention: using joy as a form of resistance. “I think it's essential for us to realize that we're not alone, and our ancestors have been through much worse. I've chosen to focus on joy because I believe joy is a form of resistance. We are resilient, and the thought and the act of reclaiming our resilience has a lot to do with owning our power and our capabilities and not getting caught up in the title of your job,” she shares.

Title: Melinda Gates-backed women's health startup Tia just cut 23% of its workforce

Every time Rebecca publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Women's health startup Tia has slashed about 23% of its staff, Business Insider has learned. The company, which provides in-person and virtual care tailored to women, cut 27% of its corporate team, or 17 people; 22% of its providers, or 27 people; and 23% of its field support team, or 28 people, according to an email to employees sent Monday evening by Tia CEO Felicity Yost. Tia's layoffs show how even buzzy, well-funded startups are being forced to reckon with healthcare's economic pressures against venture capital's growth expectations. Once a rising star backed by Melinda French Gates, Tia is now under pressure to prove that its hybrid model of tech-enabled women's clinics can actually turn a profit. The demise of similar healthcare startups like former Silicon Valley darling Forward has shown how hard tech-enabled healthcare can be to scale; even Amazon owned-health clinic company One Medical has struggled with profitability. Tia confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Business Insider. Tia operates as a one-stop healthcare shop for women, providing services from gynecology and primary care to mental healthcare, with options for in-person and virtual care. The startup runs 11 clinics, according to its website, including six locations in Los Angeles, two in New York City, one in San Francisco, and two in Arizona. Yost told employees in her email that the layoffs were a response to feedback Tia received in a recent fundraise. Yost said Tia sought that funding after its business's underperformance meant Tia would not be able to reach profitability without more cash. The feedback from the fundraise "required us to rethink our business in the current economic and policy climate, which is one that prizes cost and profit-consciousness," Yost said in her email. "We must manage towards a faster timeline to be corporate-level profitable than we previously contemplated." "Tia has seen strong growth, particularly in membership, which has outpaced our expectations for 2025. At the same time, we're facing ongoing structural challenges impacting the broader care delivery sector, such as cost pressures from rising labor rates and tighter reimbursement rates, which require us to be more disciplined in our operations," a Tia spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. In-person clinics have proven difficult to sustain financially, even for well-funded healthcare companies. Forward shut down abruptly in November 2024 after raising over $650 million to scale its tech-driven clinics and automated "CarePods." Primary care chain VillageMD has begun selling its clinics after spinning off from Walgreens in the retailer's sale to Sycamore Partners in August; Walgreens had announced plans to close 160 VillageMD clinics in April 2024 to curb losses. Walmart shuttered all 51 of its health centers later in April, citing a lack of profitability. While Tia hasn't announced a round of funding since its $100 million Series B in 2021, Yost's email to employees references Tia's "Series C growth plan." Tia didn't respond to a question from Business Insider about its Series C. The startup also raised an undisclosed amount of Series B extension funding from Melinda French Gates' Pivotal Ventures in 2023, which Tia said brought its total funding to $150 million. "Across healthcare, we're seeing organizations respond to market trends that favor operational efficiency, sustainable growth, and sharper financial discipline. Tia is doing the same, and from a position of strength," the Tia spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that Tia has more health system partnerships and expansion announcements planned for early next year. Yost said in her email to employees that the fires in Los Angeles in early January had challenged Tia's business in the first quarter. She also cited "slower than necessary growth that hampered our business." Tia introduced new projects in the second quarter, "meant to counteract the dip in Q1 performance," Yost wrote. Those initiatives included a new model to allow patients to get care from Tia without becoming a member, a partnership for Tia members to access compounded GLP-1 prescriptions, and a national rollout of Tia's virtual care services. While the new no-membership-required model outperformed expectations, Yost said, underperformance across the rest of the business led Tia to seek additional funding because "we would not achieve profitability with our existing cash runway, as planned." Yost said Tia did ultimately secure additional funding, but received feedback in the process that led to the layoffs. Yost and Witte started Tia in 2016, focusing on in-person clinics. The startup began rolling out virtual care services in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later shifted to a hybrid model. Tia's last reported layoff occurred in July 2022, as Business Insider reported the following November. Tia cofounder and then-CEO Carolyn Witte told BI that the layoffs were a preemptive response to the market downturn so Tia could continue to grow responsibly. Witte stepped down as Tia's CEO in April 2024 and into the role of Tia's chairwoman. Witte said a LinkedIn post about her departure from the role that Yost, formerly Tia's president, would serve as Tia's interim CEO. A Tia spokesperson told Business Insider after publication that Witte had stepped down as board chair shortly after departing the CEO position. Yost is now Tia's permanent CEO. In addition to the layoffs, Yost said in her Monday email that Tia would make significant changes to its operating expenses, including to its tools and contracts, and cut compensation for its senior leaders. Yost also said that Tia could no longer afford to hire clinical roles ahead of demand and "must creatively rethink how we optimize our administrative and care support roles across a broader range of responsibilities." She said the startup aims to make these changes without compromising its high-quality patient care standards. Employees affected by the Tuesday layoffs, including patient-facing providers, were cut off from Tia's systems immediately following the email.

Title: Tech industry stalling as AI takes over, with junior roles cut in half

Graduate tech jobs are down 46% from last year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new report from the Institute of Student Employers (ISE) has found that the UK tech industry has experienced a 46% drop in tech graduate jobs from 2024, and a further 53% drop projected in 2026. This probably won’t come as much of a shock to many, but recent tech graduates most likely have AI to blame for the dramatic decline in jobs on offer. After all, why train a junior worker for basic digital tasks, coding, or data analysis when you could ask AI to do it? The UK isn’t the only country suffering. Junior tech workers are in trouble across the world. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab released statistics confirming that entry level tech job postings are down 67% between 2023-2024, with a 13% drop in employment for 22-25 year-olds since AI arrived on the scene at the end of 2022. Tech jobs aren’t the only ones facing this issue. Employers reduced hiring by 8% in the last academic year (2024/2025), and another 7% is predicted for the coming year - but this figure focuses on responses from three large employers. “It is a tough market for students and young people in general. There is not much churn in the labour market and young people are suffering,” Stephen Isherwod, joint chief executive of ISE, told the Financial Times. The data suggests that organisations are simply focusing on hiring experienced workers, and cutting juniors out of the company structure as a cost saving measure, and to become more efficient. Whilst companies may see short-term gains with this strategy, it sets up a scenario for 10-20 years time when experienced professionals are set to retire, but no one has invested in training any juniors to take their place.

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI, with AI reporter Sharon Goldman. In this edition…a TikTok-like AI video app that is built for Gen Z…Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom…TSMC profit surges 39% to hit yet another record on AI chip demand…Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Demi Guo, the 27-year-old founder of AI video company Pika, holds degrees in mathematics and computer science. But she’s also always had a creative streak, including writing poetry, and she loves showing off on social media with image and video tools. That’s why she dropped out of her Stanford Ph.D program and co-founded Pika in April 2023 with aspiring animator and fellow Ph.D student Chenlin Meng. Just as AI video companies like Runway were starting to get hot, the duo, after experimenting with making long-form generative AI films, decided to create an easier-to-use AI video generator—sparking interest from top Silicon Valley investors like Nat Friedman. Now, has Pika has raised about $135 million at a $470 million valuation and boasts 16.4 million users across several creative apps. It recently launched a new TikTok-like AI video app, also called Pika, that is already trending, and last week it debuted a new feature in that app called Predictive Video. Unlike other video tools which require long prompts to generate good results, Predictive Video allows users to upload a selfie and say something simple, like “make me a rock star,” or “I’m giving a TED Talk,” or “make me sing in Japanese”; the tool then infers your intent, delivering a complete video with a script, music and dance moves, background, lighting, and camera angles and visual effects. Instead of just producing a standalone video clip, Pika can anticipate motion and interaction, producing a sort of mixed reality by allowing users to weave themselves or real-world elements into AI-generated scenes—something that traditionally would take significant animation skills and production time. All of it is tailor-made for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, cohorts which have grown up on short-form video and uses online platforms to express themselves and share their thoughts, Guo explained. “Most nonprofessionals will never try to create a film using generative AI, but lots of people like to make short videos,” she said. “It’s really about self-expression.” That, she insists, is the opposite of what has become a catch-all tool for AI video: Slop. There may be artificial content at scale, but Pika is meant to, ironically, use generative AI to help people get more real, she says. “We really believe it is not meaningless content,” she emphasized. “It’s about self-expression, the personality is actually real behind it. So a person who is funny will post funny videos, or a person that is very egocentric will post egocentric videos.” Some people like to use one visual effect, or create a video that captures a vibe or a mood, or simply use the tool to do what they wish they could do in real life, she added. “It helps you achieve that in some sense,” she said. “Maybe you are a really bad singer, but in AI, you can sing very well, like a pop star.” Pika is stepping into a competitive landscape dominated by giants like OpenAI’s Sora and Meta’s new Vibes, but it’s carving out a very different niche. Sora is focused on cinematic, photorealistic text-to-video generation, and Vibes is about bringing AI-generated video feeds into Meta’s massive ecosystem. But Pika positions itself closer to the ground-level habits of Gen Z and Gen Alpha: It’s less about polished productions at scale, and more about emotion, creativity and interaction for everyday storytelling. With that, here’s more AI news.

A glimpse into AI’s small, cheap, DIY future – by Sharon Goldman Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say – by Jason Del Rey Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom. According to the New York Times, a surge of AI start-ups is reshaping San Francisco’s housing market, driving up demand and prices and intensifying competition for apartments. After his company Cluely raised $5.3 million, 22-year-old founder Roy Lee leased eight luxury apartments just steps from the office to foster a “frat house” work culture—emblematic of how tech firms are reshaping city living. Fueled by growth from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, San Francisco rents have risen 6% in the past year, more than double New York City’s rate, with neighborhoods near A.I. hubs like Mission Bay seeing 13% spikes. The scramble for housing has led renters to tour dozens of units, face same-day rejections, and even bring cash to viewings, raising new concerns about affordability and displacement in one of America’s most expensive cities. TSMC profit surges 39% to beat estimates and hit yet another record on AI chip demand. CNBC reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) posted record third-quarter results as surging demand for artificial intelligence chips fueled a 39.1% jump in profit from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates. Revenue climbed 30.3% to NT$989.92 billion ($33.1 billion), while net income rose to NT$452.3 billion. CEO C.C. Wei said growing consumer adoption of AI models is strengthening the company’s conviction in the “AI megatrend,” prompting TSMC to raise its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and boost planned capacity investments to at least $40 billion. High-performance computing, including AI and 5G chips, accounted for 57% of revenue, and advanced 7-nanometer-and-smaller chips made up 74% of wafer sales, underscoring TSMC’s central role in supplying cutting-edge processors to clients like Nvidia and Apple. Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Variety reported that Spotify is teaming up with major music industry players—including Sony, Universal, Warner, Merlin, and Believe—to develop “responsible” AI products aimed at empowering artists and songwriters, marking one of the first large-scale collaborations between streaming and music rights holders on AI. As part of a broader push to invest heavily in AI research and product development, Spotify plans to build a generative AI lab and product team focused on four key goals: creating tools through up-front agreements with labels and publishers; allowing artists and rights holders to opt in to generative music technologies; opening new revenue streams; and strengthening artist-fan connections. The initiative reflects a growing effort across the music industry to shape how AI is integrated into creative and commercial practices. Oct. 21-22: TedAI San Francisco.

That's how many Americans are familiar with AI mental health tools, according to a new YouGov survey that highlights just how far such tools have to go to win over the public. A mere 11% say they’d consider using one, and trust is even lower—just 8% say they trust AI in this space, while 40% explicitly don’t. The top reasons for skepticism: concerns about lack of human nuance (53%), harmful or inaccurate advice (50%), and data privacy (49%). And despite the flood of startups and investment in AI therapy apps, only 4% of Americans have ever tried one. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

As much as 15% of Amazon's HR staff might be cut When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon workers could be facing yet another round of layoffs with as much as 15% of its human resources department at risk, Fortune reports have claimed. Sources confirm that the People eXperience Technology team (Amazon’s HR) is likely to be the hardest hit, but other consumer businesses are also in the firing line. Amazon’s workforce has been steadily decreasing since the end of 2022, with around 27,000 staff being laid off across a range of departments. This is continuing, especially with Amazon recently confirming it expects to cut human workers and replace them with AI. It seems clear that Amazon is reducing its workforce spending in order to prop up the $100 billion spend on data centers and infrastructure to support AI and data processing - pushing the company to a 32% global cloud market share during Q1 of 2025. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has overseen somr recent dramatic cuts as well as huge data center spending, wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog; “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” This is part of an industry-wide pattern, with Intel planning to slash around 20% of its workforce, or around 25,000 employees in total. Alongside this, Microsoft let go roughly 9,000 of its staff as it pushes for investment into AI.

Title: Forbes Daily: Luxury Stock Surge Boosts Bernard Arnault’s Fortune

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Luxury fashion saw an investor resurgence on Wednesday, as French conglomerate LVMH reported an increase in quarterly sales growth for the first time this year. The CAC 40, a French stock market index featuring Hermès, Kering and LVMH, among others, closed up nearly 2% on Wednesday. LVMH’s rise also added to chairman Bernard Arnault’s fortune by more than $18 billion. The performance of LVMH, which includes brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Sephora, will “likely set a positive tone for the upcoming luxury reporting season,” analysts said. A positive turnaround for sales in China drove the gains, Reuters reported. Despite ongoing trade tensions, the Chinese government said Apple would boost investment in the country, though it did not provide details on the size of the investment. The company’s CEO Tim Cook made a trip to China this week, even as President Donald Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on the country after it enacted export controls over rare earths. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump Administration from laying off workers during the government shutdown, meaning those employees will have their jobs secured for at least two more weeks. Federal workers’ unions had argued the layoffs were being used as an unlawful pressure tactic against Democrats, and the judge said Wednesday that the government is using the shutdown to “assume all bets are off, the laws don’t apply to them anymore.” As the One Big Beautiful Bill Act limits student loans for parents and graduate students, the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, whose students rely more heavily on federal loans, are bracing for impact. But some billionaires are stepping in and supporting the institutions—including Atlanta Falcons owner and Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who this week committed $50 million in scholarships for students at four Atlanta HBCUs. Andy Slavitt left his government job and set out to use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities in 2018 through healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures. Since then, the firm has invested in 35 companies and started seven others. Now, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. A Colorado couple raked in millions in sales for a device that claims to help stop people from choking to death. The Dechoker was marketed as FDA-approved—but the government agency had not only never approved the device, it told the Carvers to stop selling the product entirely in 2023, records show. Anti-choking devices have been shown to be potentially more harmful than helpful, and Amazon began removing the Dechoker and rival unapproved suction devices after Forbes asked the retailer about them. Brown University became the latest institution to reject a deal with the Trump Administration that would have provided special federal funding considerations in exchange for widespread changes to its policies. In a letter to government officials, the school’s president said the deal would “restrict academic freedom” and undermine the autonomy of its governance. The U.S. military is considering land strikes against Venezuelan drug cartels, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday, a potential escalation of the controversial military operations aimed at curbing drug smuggling into the U.S. The president also said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in the country, and alleged that Venezuela’s top officials have “emptied their prisons into the United States of America.” Inflation and tariff disruptions have had a big impact on the cost of your morning cup of joe, as coffee prices have risen more than 20% since August 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazil and 20% on Vietnam, the two countries that together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans. For decades, Stanford Health Care had been trying to install a state-of-the-art proton therapy machine to add to its array of high tech cancer treatments. But try as it might, it just couldn’t find a place to put one. Three years ago, Stanford found an alternative: Startup Leo Cancer Care had developed a variation on the standard proton therapy machine design. Instead of rotating the radiation beam around a patient laying flat in a bed, it used a chair in which a seated patient rotated around the beam. That seemingly simple change had transformative consequences. It helped trim the space required for the machine to about 1,700 square feet from more than 29,000 square feet—a more than 90% reduction. That made it significantly less expensive and easier to fit where they wanted it. So Stanford teamed up Leo Cancer Care, which makes the chair and imaging technology, with Mevion Medical Systems, which had developed a small proton accelerator, and in 2024 they started building out the new facility. It’s still early days for Leo Cancer Care, and this is a hard and capital-intensive business. But the company, which has raised a total of $150 million at a valuation of $280 million, including a recent $40 million round led by Catalio Capital Management, is gaining traction. Revenue reached $11 million last year, and is expected to more than double this year. WHY IT MATTERS The number of proton therapy machines in use today is tiny: There are only 46 proton centers in the U.S. and just over 100 worldwide, Leo Cancer Care cofounder and CEO Stephen Towe said, while the global need for them is closer to 2,000. Proton therapy provides greater targeting in cancer treatment, allowing patients to receive effective therapy with less damage to normal tissue and lower radiation risk, but its cost has been prohibitive.

Nestlé layoffs: Switzerland-based fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Nestlé SA is planning to cut 16,000 jobs after its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Philipp Navratil, took charge and vowed to turn the company around. Nestlé SA's move to cut 16,000 jobs represents nearly 6% of the total number of employees working at the FMCG firm. “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” Nestlé CEO Philipp Navratil said in an official statement. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount.” However, the company also announced that a layoff of this scale will be carried out over the next two years, affecting employees working for the KitKat candy bar maker in an effort to save 1 billion Swiss francs in costs. Mint reported earlier that the layoffs include 12,000 white-collar jobs, in addition to the 4,000 job cuts already underway in production and the supply chain. 1. TCS or Tata Consultancy Services: Tata Group's IT arm, Tata Consultancy Services, has already laid off 6,000 employees, which represents 1% of its global headcount. The IT major also plans to cut another 6,000 jobs, bringing the total to 12,000 layoffs, or approximately 2% of its total workforce, as part of the company's restructuring plans amid the push for artificial intelligence (AI) in the industry. 2. Nestlé SA: The FMCG giant plans to cut 16,000 jobs, which amounts to nearly 6% of the company's total workforce. 3. Amazon: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% of job roles in departments, including human resources (People eXperience Technology team), consumer business, among others. 4. Google: Big tech giant reportedly laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 5. Accenture: The tech company in September 2025 announced that they are going to lay off more than 11,000 employees in a company-wide restructuring move. 6. Salesforce: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut the jobs of 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over in the IT and services industry. The company reduced its customer support workforce from 9,000 employees to 5,000 employees, marking 4,000 job cuts. 7. Microsoft: In 2025, Microsoft laid off more than 15,000 employees and around 2,000 more staff who were deemed as underperformers from the big tech firm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a memo, explained how the company has carried out the restructuring based on an objective measure considering the firm's ‘market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right.’ Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

A historic surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has Wall Street buzzingâbut also bracing for a potential crash. Nvidia, once a niche chipmaker, now boasts a staggering $4.5 trillion valuation, while OpenAIâs deals with tech giants like Microsoft, AMD and Oracle raise concerns about financial circularity. With industry leaders warning of overinvestment and economists comparing the frenzy to past bubbles, the question looms: Is AI the next dot-com bust waiting to happen? The AI stock surge: Euphoria or excess? Since ChatGPTâs 2022 debut, AI has dominated markets. Nvidiaâs chips power the AI revolution, fueling its meteoric rise. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta have also seen explosive growth, collectively driving 80% of S&P 500 gains. Oracleâs stock soared 40% in a single day after securing OpenAI contractsâa sign of investor euphoria. But skepticism mounts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited," while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warns of an "industrial bubble." Bank of England analysts caution that markets are "exposed" if AI optimism falters. The parallels to the late-1990s dot-com bubbleâwhen vendor financing inflated valuations before a brutal crashâare hard to ignore. Circular deals and financial engineering Recent AI financing arrangements have drawn scrutiny for their self-reinforcing nature: Nvidia invests $100B in OpenAI, which then builds data centers using Nvidia chips. OpenAI buys AMD chips, taking a potential 10% stake in the company. Microsoft funds OpenAI while also relying on Nvidia-powered cloud services. Critics call this "vendor financing"âa tactic used during the dot-com bubble to artificially inflate demand. Goldman Sachs acknowledges "elements of investor behavior" mirror past bubbles but argues todayâs AI boom is backed by real profitsâfor now. The bubble debate: Optimism vs. caution Proponents insist AIâs transformative potential justifies the spending. OpenAIâs revenue growth is unprecedented, and Altman argues the industry is still undervalued. Federal Reserve officials even suggest this could be a "good bubble," driving innovation despite financial risks. Yet MIT research found that 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver returns, despite $30â40B in spending. Venture capitalist Alan Patricof warns, "The losses will be pretty significant." Meanwhile, AIâs impact on jobs remains uncertainâAnthropicâs CEO predicts mass white-collar layoffs, while McKinsey sees AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement. The road ahead: Crash or correction? Three scenarios could burst the AI bubble: Concentration risk: If OpenAI or Nvidia stumble, a domino effect could destabilize the sector. Governance failures: Poor oversight (like FTXâs collapse) could trigger regulatory crackdowns. Technological disruption: Quantum computing breakthroughs could render current AI infrastructure obsolete. Despite warnings, AIâs momentum shows no signs of slowing. The question isnât if but when reality catches upâand whether the fallout will be a minor correction or a catastrophic crash. A bubble with a fifference? Unlike the dot-com era, todayâs AI investments are fueled by trillion-dollar tech giants with vast cash reservesânot speculative startups. Yet history suggests unchecked exuberance rarely ends well. Whether AI reshapes the economy or becomes the next speculative bust, one truth remains: Investors should tread carefully.

Title: Intel laid me off — and I could see it coming. My third layoff in a decade has been the toughest to bounce back from.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kent Ha, a 37-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who previously worked as a digital marketing strategist at Intel. He holds a bachelor's degree in new media communications from Oregon State University and an MBA from George Fox University with a concentration in leadership and management. He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe — getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 — once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment — and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan — that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching — and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers — and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs — but what actually worked was posting my résumé on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams — for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my résumé — with help from ChatGPT — to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in — she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard — I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity — that's what keeps me going.

Title: Tech Workers Versus Enshittification

Time Published: 2025-10-15T17:34:50Z
Full Content:
The men who appeared on the dais behind President Trump at his inauguration were never good men. Take Tim Cook. Cook owes his elevation to Apple CEO—which made him a billionaire twice over—to his leadership in moving Apple manufacturing to “iPhone City” in south China.3 Other Apple execs had tried this, but they could never get the precision and reliability Apple demanded. Cook managed it, but the brutal working conditions created by Foxconn, Apple’s contract manufacturer there, led to the installation of suicide nets5 to catch workers who leapt to their death rather than facing another shift. Or look at Jeff Bezos. Workers in Bezos’s warehouses are injured (often critically) at three times the rate of workers in other companies’ warehouses.7 Bezos’s contract drivers have to relieve themselves in bottles because they are not given toilet breaks. They are also monitored by AI cameras that score their eyeball movements.11 Google’s top bosses covered up for a senior manager who allegedly preyed on a female subordinate, whom he subjected to violent sex acts. He was given millions of dollars to go away quietly12 while his victim was prohibited from suing by the “binding arbitration” waivers in her contract. These men have always abused anyone they could get away with abusing. If they seemed to treat some people well—for example, the pampered coders who get gourmet cafeterias, free massages, and all the kombucha they can drink—it was because they feared the difficulties of replacing those workers. Now that U.S. Big Tech has shed more than 400,000 jobs in just two years, there’s a reserve army of desperate techies who can be given the suicide-net-and-urine-bottle treatment. One of the first official acts of the current administration was to cancel every single labor investigation and enforcement action in the entire country.8 The administration’s antitrust boss canceled investigations into predatory pricing (selling goods below cost to drive out competitors) and surveillance pricing (using commercial surveillance data to charge you more (for example, by increasing the price of your breakfast sandwich on payday) or pay you less (for example, offering nurses lower wages if they are known to have overdue credit card bills).10 Instead of helping workers and shoppers resist predatory assaults fueled and perpetrated by Big Tech, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission chair is focusing all his energies on a new snitch line where FTC employees can report “wokeism.”4 The men who run Big Tech have always wanted to “enshittify” their services—to shift as much as they can from users, workers, suppliers, and business customers to themselves. The forces that prevented that—militant, scarce workers; competitors; regulators; and rival technologies—were critically weakened and even eliminated over the past 40 years. Biden’s administration was the first in two generations to take fighting corporate abuses seriously.1 Is it any wonder that Big Tech were all in for his rival? Enshittification would be much, much worse if not for tech workers. Tech workers have historically enjoyed remarkable workplace status—not just the material perks, from dry cleaning to personal trainers, but also the power to tell their bosses to go to hell. When your skills are in such high demand that you can quit your job, walk across the street, and get a better one later that same day, your boss has a real incentive to make you feel like you are their social equal, empowered to say and do whatever feels technically right, or just, you know, show up for work with facial piercings, a green mohawk, and a black t-shirt from Defcon with writing on it that your boss doesn’t understand but still feels uncomfortable about. Tech workers may have given their bosses tsuris and demanded sky-high wages, but at least they were wildly productive. The per-worker revenue for successful tech companies is unfathomable—tens or even hundreds of times their wages and stock compensation packages.2 What’s more, many tech businesses had more work than they could hire skilled workers to perform, so bosses’ strategy focused on getting the workers they could hire to put in longer hours. That strategy has a name: “vocational awe,” a term coined by the librarian-theorist Fobazi Ettarh to describe the grueling hours endured by workers who believe in the social value of their work. Teachers, nurses, librarians—any profession whose practitioners are motivated by a sense of duty is a profession vulnerable to vocational awe. Tech companies have been widely derided for their grandiose mission statements, such as Google’s “organize all the world’s information and make it useful” or Facebook’s “making the world more open and connected.” But whether the management of these companies believed in these high-minded words, they were absolutely internalized by employees, who—despite their job security—worked every hour god sent, sleeping under their desks and missing their parents’ funerals to hit their bosses’ arbitrary deadlines. As a motivational tactic, vocational awe (or, as Elon Musk puts it, “being extremely hardcore”) works very well, but it fails very badly. It turns out that when you actually care about your job, and when your boss can’t replace you, and when you can get a new job whenever you want, it’s damned hard to convince you to wreck the things you built and harm your users, even if that will make your boss more money. For many years, tech workers have been the last line of defense between Internet users and tech bosses, bravely holding the line on enshittification. But once tech started to shed workers en masse—260,000 layoffs in 2023,6 another 160,000 in 20249—the power of workers was shattered. Scarcity can give workers power, but scarcity is temporary: Eventually, enough people train to work in your industry, or your boss figures out how to outsource your job to overseas workers with fewer protections and rights, and your power is shattered. No wonder tech bosses are so excited about AI coding tools, which promise to turn skilled programmers from creative problem-solvers to mere code reviewers for AI as it produces tech debt at scale. Code reviewers never tell their bosses to go to hell, and they are a lot easier to replace. Now that tech workers are as disposable as Amazon warehouse workers and drivers, as disposable as the factory workers in iPhone City, it’s only a matter of time until the job conditions are harmonized downward. Jeff Bezos doesn’t force his delivery drivers to relieve themselves in bottles because he hates delivery drivers. Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow his coders to use a restroom whenever they need to because he loves hackers. The factor that determines how Jeff Bezos treats workers is “What is the worst treatment those workers can be forced to accept?” Throughout the entire history of human civilization, there has only ever been one way to guarantee fair wages and decent conditions for workers: unions. Even non-union workers benefit from unions, because strong unions are the force that causes labor protection laws to be passed, which protect all workers. Tech workers have historically been monumentally uninterested in unionization, and it’s not hard to see why. Why go to all those meetings and pay those dues when you could tell your boss to go to hell on Tuesday and have a new job by Wednesday? That’s not the case anymore. It will likely never be the case again. Interest in tech unions is at an all-time high. Groups such as Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition are doing a land-office business, and copies of Ethan Marcotte’s You Deserve a Tech Union are flying off the shelves. Now is the time to get organized. Your boss has made it clear how you’d be treated if they had their way. They’re about to get it. Walking a picket line is a slog, to be sure, but picket lines beat piss bottles, hands down.

Title: Khosla Ventures And Cleveland Clinic Partner On Healthcare Tech
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2025/10/15/khosla-ventures-and-cleveland-clinic-partner-on-healthcare-tech/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T16:00:22Z
Full Content:
ByAmy Feldman, Forbes Staff andAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at the Khosla Ventures-Cleveland Clinic partnership, Town Hall Ventures’ $440 million haul, the CDC’s “Friday night massacre,” Boehringer’s new pulmonary fibrosis drug, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. New technologies are transforming the way that hospitals operate. To try and gain an edge, Khosla Ventures and Cleveland Clinic signed a deal in which the health system will test new technologies that span AI, digital health and next-generation therapeutics from the VC firm’s portfolio companies—and the two will explore opportunities to incubate new companies together. “I think this is a novel approach,” Hal Paz, Khosla Ventures’ operating partner, told Forbes. Discussions that led to the agreement, announced at Cleveland Clinic’s Life Sciences Summit in London on Tuesday, had been in the works for a year. The storied VC firm, with $17 billion in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio companies (about one-third of them in healthcare), gains a substantial healthcare partner with whom to test new technologies from clinical validation through adoption, that may also become a valuable customer for the companies it’s invested in. Meanwhile, Cleveland Clinic, the highly-regarded non-profit health system that spans 23 hospitals and 280 outpatient facilities, gets access to a pipeline of emerging technologies that could help it improve care and efficiency. Already, some 10 to 12 of Khosla’s portfolio companies, mostly in AI and digital health, are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic about how they could work with the health system, Paz said. One, Vista AI, which has developed AI to automate and simplify cardiac MRIs, is already working with Cleveland Clinic at its Akron hospital. Vista’s software enables more scans to be done on a single machine with improved quality and consistency. The two are also already working on a first startup incubation, though neither the final idea nor the timing of its launch has been set. “We are at an inflection point in the industry,” said JD Friedland, Cleveland Clinic’s executive director of venture. “New transformational technologies are emerging that we believe are going to fundamentally address some of the perpetual challenges in healthcare.” The agreement comes as tech-based venture firms have increasingly viewed healthcare as an area of opportunity and as hospitals and health systems have been testing how technology could improve patient care, reduce physician burnout and increase razor-thin margins. It also follows a move by General Catalyst to acquire health system Summa Health, a $515 million deal that created the first hospital system to be owned by a VC firm. “I bet the more significant venture investors in healthcare are going to find different ways to get access to that clinical and research expertise,” Cleveland Clinic’s Friedland said. “It certainly costs a lot less money to partner with Cleveland Clinic than to buy a hospital, and it comes with less strings attached and less brain damage.” For both Khosla and Cleveland Clinic, their non-exclusive partnership could be the first of multiple collaborations—but both Paz and Friedland stressed there was much to do first. Said Paz: “Before we get over our skis and think about the second health system to partner with and the third, we need to give this a little time and learn from it.” When Andy Slavitt left government, he wanted to prove that you could use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities—and still make a profit. The former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and overseer of the successful turnaround of healthcare.gov, set up healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures in the summer of 2018 to do just that. “I’ve got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,” he told Forbes. “If [investors] think you are impact, they’ll put you in this bucket—people who do nice things and maybe some nice family office wants to invest in you because they’ve got an impact mandate. I have always resisted that.” Since its launch seven years ago, Town Hall Ventures has invested in 35 companies and started seven others, including kidney care specialist Strive and Suvida, which offers primary care focused on Hispanic seniors and their families. Its first fund posted top-decile performance, with a net internal rate of return from its July 2018 inception (thru June 30) of 33% versus 12% for the median VC fund. A total of 10 its bets surpassed a billion-dollar valuation, including Cityblock Health, a healthcare provider focused on low-income communities that was one of its initial investments and has since reached a valuation of $6.2 billion; SignifyHealth, a provider of tech-enabled at-home risk assessment acquired by CVS for $8 billion in 2023; and Landmark Health, a startup offering in-home medical care to patients with chronic conditions purchased by Optum Health for $3.5 billion in 2021. Buoyed by that track record, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has now raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. While the New York-based firm, whose general partners consist of Slavitt, David Whelan and Meera Mani, remains small compared to venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst or Sequoia, each of which has tens of billions in assets under management, it’s a well-regarded player in healthcare.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease in which scarring on the lungs makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Martin Beck, head of Boehringer’s inflammation disease area, told trade publication Fierce Pharma that the drug represented a major shift forward in treating a disease that had been a “graveyard of clinical development” with more than 36 failed trials over the past decade. Jascayd blocks a type of enzyme, called PDE4B, that’s involved in the honeycomb-patterned lung scarring and inflammation associated with the disease. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that it slowed patients’ decline in lung function compared to a placebo over the course of a year. Plus: Obesity startup Kailera Therapeutics raised $600 million, led by Bain Capital Private Equity, to start Phase III trials of its lead drug candidate, an injectable GLP-1 drug similar to Lilly’s Zepbound. The size of the round ties it with Isomorphic Labs for the largest biotech fundraise of the year. Forbes profiled Kailera earlier this year. Kailera was worth $1.5 billion before the new funding; its new valuation was not disclosed. Duos, a digital health company focused on seniors, raised $130 million, led by FTV Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The two-year-old company helps members enroll in government programs, retain Medicaid coverage and figure out benefits they may be eligible for but aren’t using. Plus: Umar Afridi, a pharmacist who previously cofounded Truepill, raised $20 million to bring AI to pharmacy operations with Foundation Health. Truepill was acquired by LetsGetChecked for $525 million last year. Digital Health-focused VC firm Define Ventures led the funding round. Biotech startup Immusoft safely re-dosed a patient with its experimental gene therapy for progressive genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I that causes skeletal abnormalities, heart disease and vision loss. The company’s gene therapy makes use of engineered B-cells, which the body typically uses to make antibodies, to make specific proteins that treat diseases instead. The benefit of the approach is that it doesn’t require immunosuppression or chemotherapy as other gene therapies do. The ability to safely re-dose makes the therapy more long-lasting, which had been a question during its clinical trial. Forbes spoke with CEO Sean Ainsworth about the company’s technology earlier this year. Plus: Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its orthopedics business, which generated $9.2 billion in revenue in 2024. The new company, called DePuy Synthes, is expected to launch in 2027. Last Friday, around 1,300 CDC employees received notices that they’d been laid off with no warning. Over the weekend, more than half appear to have been told their firing was rescinded, though some 600 employees still appear to remain fired, according to the National Public Health Coalition, an organization of former CDC employees. So far, many of the departments hit appear to be core to the agency’s work, including the CDC library, which provides access to crucial scientific data for agency scientists; the agency’s entire Washington office, which provides information and support to Congress, the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and staff focused on data collection and disease surveillance. The Health and Human Services Department blamed the layoffs on the current government shutdown and said that employees laid off had been declared non-essential. This is one of several waves of layoffs that have eliminated around 25% of the CDC’s staff since Trump took office. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the Trump Administration, challenging the legality of layoffs during a government shutdown. In a lawsuit over a previous round of layoffs, a federal judge found that the Administration’s firing of CDC staff was likely unlawful. “Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump Administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” John Brooks, former chief medical officer for CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, told reporters at an National Public Health Coalition press conference on Tuesday. In response these ongoing program cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported today that 15 states, all with Democratic governors, are building an alliance to manage public health threats. The states have agreed that they will “help one another prepare for pandemics, track infectious diseases, write public-health guidelines, share expertise on preventive care and buy vaccines and supplies in bulk.” Novo Nordisk agreed to acquire Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion for its experimental liver disease treatment. San Francisco-based Akero has been testing its drug, efruxifermin, as a treatment for MASH, which causes fat to build up on the liver, leading to fibrosis. The deal follows Roche’s announcement last month that it was buying 89bio for $3.5 billion for its experimental MASH drug. Amazon sellers made millions from banned “Dechoker” medical devices, according to the FDA. Biotech dealmaking, from M&A to venture investments, ticked up in the third quarter. Political pressures are influencing work at FDA, according to career staffers there. Consumer Reports found that some protein shakes and powders contain extremely high levels of lead. Mixtures of common drugs that wind up in waterways may accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to research led by the University of Exeter. Wearable health company Oura raised $900 million led by Fidelity, bringing its valuation to $11 billion. That’s more than double the $5.2 billion it was worth last December. The United Nations World Food Programme warned that nearly 14 million people faced severe hunger due to cuts in global aid, especially from the Trump Administration.

Amazon is reportedly planning significant layoffs, targeting about 15% of its human resources staff and potentially impacting other departments. This move aligns with the tech giant's strategy to invest heavily in artificial intelligence while reducing employee costs. CEO Andy Jassy has previously indicated that AI adoption will lead to workforce reductions as the company seeks efficiency gains.

Title: Amazon plans layoffs: From Accenture to TCS, these companies have handed pink slips to employees this year

Amazon plans layoffs: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% job roles in its human resources department, along with certain other roles, Fortune reported on Wednesday, 15 October 2025. According to the news portal's report, Amazon's HR department, also known as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, will bear the majority of the cuts, while other departments, such as the consumer business, may also experience some impact. Amazon's HR department has more than 10,000 people employed globally. The company is reportedly laying off staff as the e-commerce giant aims to reduce its employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure. Big IT companies such as TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are among other firms that have carried out restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce costs amid the rise of AI. TCS is cutting nearly 12,000 employees, or around 2% of its global workforce, in the financial year 2025-26, amid restructuring plans and a push for AI expansion. In the case of Wipro, although there is no official confirmation of layoffs, media reports suggest that the IT major has cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Global IT services giant Accenture announced in September 2025 that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees across its global workforce, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over. Salesforce reportedly reduced its customer support workforce to 5,000 employees, down from its earlier 9,000 employees, marking a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees. 1. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — Laid off 6,000 employees or 1% of its headcount. It will lay off another 6,000 employees to cut a total of 12,000 jobs or 2% of its total workforce. 2. Google — Laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 3. Accenture — To lay off 11,000 employees across its global workforce. 4. Salesforce — Cut nearly 4,000 customer support staff. 5. Microsoft — Cut more than 40% or nearly 4,000 jobs in its software engineering business. 6. IBM — Cut nearly 1,000 job roles as the firm shifted to its hybrid cloud and AI business. 7. Cognizant — Laid off 3,500 employees in an effort to simplify the organisation's structure. 8. Wipro — Cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Many tech companies around the world are facing challenges due to pressure from their US business and recent concerns about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in the H-1B visa fee. Jobs are at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to boost productivity and efficiency over that of the human workforce.

Title: 4 New AI Jobs That Pay Up To $200,000+ In 2026
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/10/15/4-new-ai-jobs-that-pay-up-to-200000-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-10-15T11:45:20Z

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. We hear a lot about AI disrupting the workforce and making millions of jobs obsolete. We’ve seen AI-related layoffs last year and this year, with plans being drawn up for more layoffs at large companies like Amazon. But what roles is artificial intelligence actually creating? What are the new jobs of the future, the roles that will be in high demand in 2026 and beyond? In this article, you’ll learn about four AI jobs that you’ve probably never heard of, which offer eye-watering lucrative salaries of up to $200,000 and above. These will be the hot jobs of 2026 and will continue to grow in demand as AI implementation is rolled out across organizations. Keep reading to discover what these AI jobs are, the responsibilities involved, and how much they pay: This is the hottest new addition to the C-suite in 2025 and will continue to rise in demand in 2026. According to Asana’s Global State of AI at Work report, companies that have experienced the most success in terms of ROI and productivity when it comes to rolling out AI across their organizations, have designated roles in place, and have a strong strategy, treating it as a business-critical resource (82%). Part of this strategy involves having someone dedicated to AI implementation, digital transformation, and AI ethics and policy in the organization. This has carved the way for this new role, Chief AI Officer, who sits at the executive level and oversees all things AI implementation and strategy. Because this role, and many of the others listed below, are fairly new, we still don’t have access to broad numbers of salary data. However, based on the available information from salary comparison sites such as ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and analyzing job listings, here is what you can expect as an average pay rate in the U.S.: Average salary: $259,502 (some companies offer eye-watering pay packages in excess of $1 million) As a generative AI content expert, you would be optimizing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), by creating high-quality training data, using your own judgment to close gaps of information, and using your creativity to train AI models that produce the best outputs. An AI content expert or strategist’s job title can also refer to using AI tools to create and deliver a content schedule on behalf of a business, using your eye for detail to tweak the output and ensure accuracy while maintaining the company’s voice. Because this title is used to mean different responsibilities, take time to thoroughly review the job description before applying, so you know what you’re getting into. This role is best suited for professionals with extensive writing experience and a strong grasp on grammar, original creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Having STEM background may also be preferred by some employers. Average salary: $55,000 to $90,000+ (there aren’t many advertized salaries in this field yet) An applied AI engineer builds, develops, and deploys customized AI solutions for a business to use internally and for their clients. Many of these roles are associated with building and deploying AI agents, which are the buzzword in workplaces right now. These customized solutions enable a business to implement AI and work at scale, using artificial intelligence in a way that best works for their needs, rendering them more effective when it comes to AI integration, or AI scalers, as Asana's State of AI report refers to them. As an example of what you’d be expected to deliver in this role, a job posting by The General Intelligence Company of New York says: When describing what they’d look for in their ideal Applied AI Agent Engineer candidate, the job posting says: Average salary: $154,442 When AI is being rolled out in an organization, there has to be guardrails in place. Otherwise, the company can incur great risk. One thing Asana’s report noted is that AI infrastructure requires three Ps: policy, psychological safety, and performance. The first P, policy, is where an AI ethics lead comes in. You’ll be responsible for “developing clear frameworks that provide guardrails without bureaucracy, defining who does what, when AI is appropriate, and how quality gets maintained.” This ensures safe practices for users as well as those on the receiving end of the output. As an example, OpenAI is currently hiring for a software engineer for AI safety, and the salary on offer is $210,000 – $325,000 plus equity. Average salary: $242,471 To succeed in these roles and land lucrative, niche, AI jobs, here’s what you need to start doing now: Keep upskilling and make your skills niche and relevant. Focus on ways that you can provide direct financial value and translate your technical expertise to niche business solutions. This is what enterprises are looking for. Constantly update and share your portfolio on LinkedIn. Then, monetize your expertise by teaching it online or by selling your projects. Finally, learn how to make your skills marketable so that you can catch the attention of employers and high-caliber clients.

Title: Amazon Cuts 15% of HR Jobs as AI Spending Continues

Δ Those cuts could include up to 15% of the tech giant’s human resources (HR) staff, Fortune reported late Tuesday (Oct. 14), citing multiple sources familiar with the plans. Aside from HR, other areas of the company’s consumer business are also likely to be affected, two of the sources said. The Fortune report notes that the cuts are happening at a time when Amazon is seeking ways to reduce employee costs while spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure for in-house use and as an enterprise offering. Amazon has said it aims to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it expands its cloud and AI datacenters. This follows a series of layoffs in other parts of the company earlier this year, including consumer devices unit, the Wondery podcast arm, and in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the time, Amazon noted that it was still hiring throughout the company, including AWS roles. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While those layoffs came soon after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence (AI) would lead to job cuts, the company stressed to PYMNTS at the time that these cuts were not connected to AI, but instead followed a review of areas that could be streamlined. PYMNTS has reached out to Amazon for comment about this latest round of cuts, but has not yet gotten a reply. Jassy in June sent a message to Amazon workers saying that employees who have learned to use AI will be in a better position to be a part of the company. He added that Amazon’s corporate workforce would likely shrink in the next few years as the company embraces AI, calling it the most transformative technology since the advent of the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” found that more than half (54%) of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The study also found that 38% of workers said they were worried the technology could eventually lead to their jobs being eliminated.

Title: Exclusive: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on AI, gold, tariffs, and crypto

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. I wasn’t surprised to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on stage yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. I’ve interviewed several women leaders over the years—TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, Travelers Chief Marketing Officer Lisa Caputo, Mary Callahan Erdoes, who runs JPMorgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management, and veteran finance executive Heidi Miller, among others—who consider Dimon an important mentor. Women make up half of JPMorgan’s board and seven of the 13 members of its operating committee. Dimon spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about topics ranging from AI to blockchain, which you can read about here and here. Fresh from reporting a banner quarter, the bank chief expounded on AI, gold, regulation, jobs, tariffs, debt, government waste, New York’s mayoral race, and “the need to keep the Western world together economically.” You can check out the full interview here. And here’s what I’ve gleaned from attendees, when it comes to Dimon’s mentorship approach: Bet on Winners: Dimon helps people who’ve earned his respect and trust, whether it’s hiring people like Miller at multiple companies or advising Duckett during her inaugural year as CEO of TIAA. That instinct isn’t limited to women: Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf comes to mind. Dimon says he’s guided by performance, not gender or loyalty. To do otherwise, in his view, is a disservice to the team. Share your network: Lisa Caputo met Dimon after he’d been fired from Citigroup and she had just arrived there. As she put it yesterday: “I was trying to build a women’s business from scratch. Every time Jamie would call, he would give me the names of three people to talk to inside the company, and he would also ask me what I’d learned so far. Through my conversations with him, he was literally helping me shape what the business model could look like.” Go Beyond Borders: Anyone who launches a $1.5 trillion initiative is seeking a purpose beyond their own company. After almost two decades as CEO, Dimon expects ambitious people may leave. Part of his job is to help good people become better leaders wherever they go. The world needs more of them. Relationships matter. And having friends in far places helps a leader learn.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Why the U.S. Supreme Court might keep Trump’s tariffs On their face, President Trump’s trade tariffs are illegal because Congress did not approve them and because routine trade is not the “emergency” that Trump claims. But the U.S. Supreme Court may rule to leave them in place anyway because of the logistical difficulty of undoing them, according to former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “The government is coming to court and saying, ‘We would have to unwind billions or trillions of dollars. It could bankrupt our nation,’” she said. Trump considers cooking oil ban for China “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China,” the president said on Truth Social. Investors took it as a signal that there would be no immediate compromise in the trade war, sending the S&P 500 down 0.16% on the day. Trump preps list of programs he will eliminate The U.S. government shutdown shows no sign of coming to an end. Yesterday the president said he was drawing up a list of “egregious socialist, semi-communist” government programs that he would eliminate permanently if Democrats in Congress don’t help him pass his spending bill. “We're closing up programs ... that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen,” Trump said. “We're not going to let them come back.” Dimon issues private credit warning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more” JPMorgan Chase wrote off $170 million in debt it was owed in the collapse of auto parts supply company First Brands, the company reported in its Q3 earnings call, and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon warned there may be more cracks in the private credit markets to come: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan also warned of “late-cycle accidents” but Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said it was not a systemic problem.

Title: Amazon likely to cut 15% jobs in new round of AI-driven layoffs: Report

Amazon is looking to eliminate 15 per cent of jobs from its human resources division even as the tech giant continues to aggressively invest in developing AI products and infrastructure. Internally referred to as the People Experience Technology (PXT) team, the HR division at Amazon comprises over 10,000 employees across the world, including a recruiting team, technology staff, and other HR-related roles. The upcoming round of layoffs at Amazon is expected to impact the PXT team hardest, according to a report by Fortune. Employees in other divisions involving Amazon’s core consumer business could also be affected by the layoffs, the report said. The exact number of employees that will be let go and when the layoffs are expected to happen is still unclear. The latest round of job cuts at Amazon comes amid a deteriorating job market for those in the tech sector, with several big tech companies looking to leverage AI tools in order to shrink headcounts and lower costs. While many AI-related layoffs are being framed as ‘restructuring’ efforts, big tech firms are simultaneously ramping up investments in data centres and compute to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Amazon, for instance, has earmarked over $100 billion in capital expenditures this year to build out its cloud and AI data centres. In June this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had announced in a memo to its 1.5 million employees that, as the company embraces AI tools across the organisation, it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy added that generative AI will ‘change the way our work is done,’ and said the company will eventually ‘need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.’ “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he further said. Taking over as CEO from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy oversaw the largest layoffs in the company’s history roughly two years ago, when Amazon cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs. Earlier this year, Amazon also laid off employees in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant also announced this week that it will be hiring over 2,50,000 seasonal employees across its warehouses and logistics networks in the US ahead of the holiday season. Omar Abdullah, former and current CM of Jammu and Kashmir, plans to join the legal fight for restoring statehood to the UT. He believes his experience makes him best suited to understand the drawbacks of being a UT. The case, with multiple petitions from citizens, was last heard on October 10.

Title: Layoff news: Amazon to slash 15% HR roles, others in new round of job cuts, says report

Amazon layoff news: E-commerce and tech giant Amazon is set to slash as much as 15 per cent roles in its human resources department, besides some other roles, in a new round of layoffs, Fortune reported citing sources. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to respond, it added. While it is expected that Amazon's HR team, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, which has over 10,000 staff globally, will take the most cuts, other core consumer business departments could also see some impact, two sources told the publication. As per the report, these job cuts come as the giant looks to reduce employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence products and AI infrastructure. Amazon has stated it aims to spend over $100 billion capex in 2025 to build its AI data centres and cloud computing centres. These will be for sale to customers and for internal use, the report added. From late 2022 into 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy signed off on at least 27,000 job cuts at Amazon — largely from its corporate offices. The period saw many large tech companies, including Meta and Google, slashing jobs. In June, Andy Jassy in a company memo stressed the importance of AI adoption to employees. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added. Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire 2,50,000 workers during its peak holiday season in full-time, part-time and seasonal roles. The company in a statement said that temporary workers will earn $19 per hour on average, and permanent roles will pay $23 per hour on average. The 2,50,000 workers on holiday hire is unchanged from the previous two years, a Bloomberg report noted.

Title: Amazon Plans To Reduce 15% Human Resources Staff, Fortune Reports

Amazon is planning to cut human resources staff by 15%, Fortune reported, citing sources. People eXperience Technology Team, human resource department of the company, will be the worst hit in the move. Core consumer business will probably to be affected by the move as well. Fortune's report did not mention how many number of employees, and when they will be laid off. Amazon's PXT division has more than 10,000 employees worldwide. The team includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional human resource roles, the report said. Compared to other companies, Amazon has laid off a relatively small number of people early this year. The layoffs happened in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and in the Amazon web series. The company is looking for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in artificial intelligence products and infrastructure. Amazon intends to increase the use of AI for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers, Fortune said. Amazon has planned to spend upwards of $100 billion capital expenditure this year as it builds its cloud and AI data centres, according to the report. Meanwhile, Amazon will likely add 250,000 to its workforce during its peak season, Bloomberg reported. The aggressive hiring during holiday season makes the company a standout in an otherwise bleak holiday labour market. Amazon will hire for full-time, part-time, and season roles with temporary workers earning an average of $19 per hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a statement from Amazon. Pay for permanent roles averages $23 per hour. US shoppers will likely spend $253.4 billion on online shopping during November and December, which indicates a 5.3% upside from 2024, according to Adobe Inc. However, shoppers are also planning to curb overall holiday spending because of tariff-related price increases and a weakening labour market, according to a survey released in September by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say

Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Two sources told Fortune that Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but that other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn’t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts. The company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon’s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles. The new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure—both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to devote upwards of $100 billion to capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI data centers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA—essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be okay losing, whether through voluntary departures, being “managed out,” or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed in a different way internally than the typical URA process. While Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its usual holiday hiring spree of warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its U.S. warehouse and logistics networks. Amazon’s stock price is down a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.
