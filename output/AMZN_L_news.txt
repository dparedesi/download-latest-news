Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

Title: Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee Sends Shockwaves Through Tech And Cybersecurity

ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. On September 19, 2025 President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one time fee does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals. The rule takes effect immediately. It also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. The proclamation is set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. Just like tariffs, everyone overreacted, and this too shall pass. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. “This came out of nowhere and could have devastating consequences for America’s innovation engine,” said one Silicon Valley venture capitalist who invests heavily in enterprise startups. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8 percent compared to 4.3 percent for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to DOGE. Agencies like CISA and DHS have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained, yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. For large technology companies the fee represents a costly inconvenience, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such Security Operating Centers moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States, and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education, and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by November 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth, and national security. The immediate shock and overreaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked, but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.

Title: American labor has a new challenge: Trump’s $100K fee on H-1B visas | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump’s latest effort to overhaul America’s legal immigration system — raising the annual fee on H-1B visa applicants from $215 to $100,000 — could deal a major blow to some US industries that rely on skilled foreign workers. During a signing at the Oval Office Friday, Trump argued that America needs “great workers” and that the newly imposed fee “pretty much ensures that that’s what’s going to happen.” Administration officials also claimed the hefty fee would incentivize companies to hire American workers. “The company needs to decide … is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home and go hire an American?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the signing. “That’s the point of immigration: Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people.” Of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, another 20,000 are reserved for people with advanced degrees from American higher education institutions. But Trump’s allies have been divided on how to tackle the visa program. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, whom Trump chose to lead the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, have defended companies that use the work visa and depend on foreign workers to operate. Steve Bannon, a top strategist in Trump’s first term, blasted H-1B visas on his “War Room” podcast in December 2024 as a “scam” by Silicon Valley titans, who are about “taking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.” Here’s what the new policy means for businesses and workers. The $100,000 visa fee, which takes effect Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET, will apply only to new H-1B applications, according to the White House. The rule expires a year later, on September 21, 2026, unless it’s extended. “This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Saturday, adding that it does not apply to renewals or current visa holders. Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, advised visa holders to reconsider international travel plans and to consider returns to the United States by Saturday night, if necessary, according to emails viewed by CNN. But Leavitt clarified Saturday afternoon that any current H-1B holders who are outside the United States will not be charged $100,000 to reenter. Most H-1B petitions approved during fiscal 2024 — which spanned from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024 — were for computer-related roles (64%), according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report. The next largest occupation was in the field of architecture, engineering and surveying (10%). The third-most-approved petitions were for education-related jobs (6%), according to USCIS. The “largest detailed industry sector” for approved H-1B visas was related to custom computer programming (25%). Professional, scientific and technical services was the No. 1 industry among employers (48%), while manufacturing (11%) was the second-most popular. According to the USCIS data hub, Amazon is the largest H-1B sponsor. The online retailing giant was approved for more than 9,000 H-1B visas during fiscal 2024. Tech giants also rely on the H-1B program, with Google sponsoring 5,364 approved H-1B visas in fiscal 2024, followed by Meta (4,844), Microsoft (4,725) and Apple (3,873). Small businesses and startups are more likely to balk at that $100,000 fee than companies like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The four companies have a combined capitalization of about $11.1 trillion. The fee could also mean foreign-born workers would be denied entry-level positions, as the $100,000 cost would be too much of a burden to pay for a lower-waged worker. Recent college graduates, who are experiencing the worst market for new grads since the Covid-19 pandemic, could stand to gain from job openings if the openings remain in America. That’s particularly good news for computer science and tech-related graduates, who are entering the market amid rounds of layoffs and plummeting opportunities. During his 2016 campaign, Trump accused US companies of using H-1B visas “for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.” But the USCIS reported that, of approved H-1B petitions, the median annual compensation was $120,000. Companies will likely continue to offer higher-paying salaries to the best talent pool of foreign workers. But restrictions could make companies shift hiring initiatives abroad to countries like India, China and Canada, according to the American Immigration Council. Placing limits on H-1B holders doesn’t guarantee Americans will be hired in the impacted sectors. When immigration slowed during the pandemic and following the first Trump administration’s temporary ban on some immigrant visas, it led to record-high job openings. Economists warned at the time that the worker shortage couldn’t be solved without ramping up immigration. “Businesses are having to turn down work because they simply can’t find the workers to do it,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNN in 2021. The new fee on visas is likely to be challenged in US courts. “To be clear, the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X. “The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.” CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo, Adam Cancryn, Matt Egan and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.

Title: President Trump to impose $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications to encourage hiring Americans

Update font size. Reset President Donald Trump is anticipated to issue a proclamation reforming the H-1B visa program, mandating a $100,000 application fee to encourage hiring American workers. The proclamation limits H-1B entry to applications accompanied by this fee, citing that program abuse has displaced American workers. Additionally, Trump intends to direct the Labor Secretary to adjust prevailing-wage levels for the H-1B program to prevent visas from being used to undercut wages typically paid to American workers. Josh Wingrove and Hadriana Lowenkron for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move is the latest immigration reform by the Trump administration and will heavily affect the technology industry in particular, as it relies heavily on H-1Bs. The administration argues that the revisions will bring more certainty to legitimate filings under the program by weeding out abuses. In a fact sheet set seen by Bloomberg News, the White House said American workers are being replaced with lower-paid foreign labor and called it a national security threat. The dynamic is suppressing wages and disincentivizing Americans from choosing careers in STEM fields, the White House said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the $100,000 figure was in addition to, or inclusive of, existing fees that are much more modest. Fees directly tied to the H-1B visa application currently include a $215 fee to register for the lottery and a $780 fee for a Form I-129, which is a petition for a non-immigrant worker that is filed by an employer sponsor. H-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but Bloomberg News has reported previously that flaws in the system create loopholes that some employers exploit by flooding the lottery with entries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: The following editorial was published by The New York Times‘ Editorial Board, June 16, 2016, five months prior to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election: Visa Abuses Harm American Workers There is no doubt that H-1B visas — temporary work permits for specially talented foreign professionals — are instead being used by American employers to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Abbott Laboratories, the health care conglomerate based in Illinois, recently became the latest large American company to use the visas in this way, following the lead of other employers, including Southern California Edison, Northeast Utilities (now Eversource Energy), Disney, Toys “R” Us and New York Life. The visas are supposed to be used only to hire college-educated foreigners in “specialty occupations” requiring “highly specialized knowledge,” and only when such hiring will not depress prevailing wages. But in many cases, laid-off American workers have been required to train their lower-paid replacements. Lawmakers from both parties have denounced the visa abuse, but it is increasingly widespread, mainly because of loopholes in the law. For example, in most instances, companies that hire H-1B workers are not required to recruit Americans before hiring from overseas. Similarly, companies are able to skirt the rules for using H-1B workers by outsourcing the actual hiring of those workers to Tata, Infosys and other temporary staffing firms, mostly based in India. Criticism of the visa process has been muted, and reform has moved slowly, partly because laid-off American workers — mostly tech employees replaced by Indian guest workers — have not loudly protested. Their reticence does not mean acceptance or even resignation. As explained in The Times on Sunday by Julia Preston, most of the displaced workers had to sign agreements prohibiting them from criticizing their former employers as a condition of receiving severance pay. The gag orders have largely silenced the laid-off employees, while allowing the employers to publicly defend their actions as legal, which is technically accurate, given the loopholes in the law. The conversation, however, is changing. Fourteen former tech workers at Abbott, including one who forfeited a chunk of severance pay rather than sign a so-called nondisparagement agreement, have filed federal claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission saying they were discriminated against because of their ages and American citizenship. Tech workers from Disney have filed federal lawsuits accusing the company and two global outsourcing firms of colluding to supplant Americans with H-1B workers. Former employees of Eversource Energy have also begun to challenge their severance-related gag orders by publicly discussing their dismissals and replacement by foreign workers on H-1B and other visas. Congressional leaders of both parties have questioned the nondisparagement agreements. Bipartisan legislation in the Senate would revise visa laws to allow former employees to protest their layoffs. Beyond that, what Congress really needs to do is close the loopholes that allow H-1B abuses. — The New York Times‘ Editorial Board, June 16, 2016 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Since well before the glorious 2016 election, I’ve been explaining Trump’s position and why the likes of Tim Cook supported his crooked, perennial failure of an opponent: For Silicon Valley and Apple’s Tim Cook, it’s all about H-1B visas and cheap labor. American companies and their shareholders, in general, want skilled labor as CHEAPLY as possible. That’s a main reason why Tim Cook, Apple and other tech firms backed the loser Clinton – they wanted unlimited H-1Bs to continue, so they can pay Ajeet from India half what they’d have to pay Tom from Tulsa who can’t find a job after graduating from college and has to live in his parents basement because Apple got Ajeet from India to do it on the CHEAP. H1-B visas for skilled workers DO NOT EQUAL uneducated illegal aliens streaming across the southern border intent on cashing in on American taxpayer’s largesse while setting up shop in the domestic drug trade and/or other crimes (gangs, rape, robbery, etc.). Trump is for upholding the laws already on the books designed to protect our borders and our nation’s sovereignty. The 2016 Trump campaign’s policy: Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program’s lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities. Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS. End welfare abuse. Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S. Jobs program for inner city youth. The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program. Refugee program for American children. Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to crack down on abuses. Use the monies saved on expensive refugee programs to help place American children without parents in safer homes and communities, and to improve community safety in high crime neighborhoods in the United States. Immigration moderation. Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers. This will help reverse women’s plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages. And, furthermore: End H1B. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/z6uuYiaXC1 — 🇺🇸Truth Teller🇺🇸 (@truthteller_x1) September 18, 2025 Perfect posting, First Then. You nailed it. The purpose of the H-1B visa program is to attract top talent without reducing U.S. wages, but most H-1B positions pay below-median wages; just one in six reaches the highest wage level. Replacing the random lottery with a wage-based ranking system would curb abuse, prioritize high-skilled roles, and better align with the program’s original goals. Also, why does the US allow vast numbers of Chinese to exploit the program, considering China is our fiercest rival? Shouldn’t we favor Japanese, Korean, i.e. friendly countries instead? Charging a $100K fee seems the wrong solution, now only large companies will be able to afford it. Definitely need to ban the gag orders, and give clear rights to foreigners who qualify for the program. What foreign worker is going to complain about unfair treatment or sub-standard wages, when they know they can easily be kicked out by their employer. Companies should have to prove not only that they are hiring a foreigner because no Americans are available, but also prove they are paying competitive wages, and workers should have some kind of leverage to “shop around” on a regular basis, without fear of being deported. Think of foreign players in the NBA for example. There shouldn’t be issues of highly-qualified foreigners working at USA companies if everyone is competing on a level playing field. The H-1B visa program tilted the field towards the companies because of too many dumb regulations. There is a Section 1(c) Exemption In Trump’s H-1B Fee Proclamation “… the Secretary of Homeland Security has the full right to determine at its discretion the applications of companies for H-1B visa holders. It would grant the exemption of $100,000 fee only if it finds the occupation workers are in the national interest and do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.” You are right, only large companies can afford the fees – or the option above… https://www.news18.com/business/explained-what-is-section-1c-exemption-in-trumps-h-1b-fee-proclamation-who-can-get-relief-ws-l-9585654.html Your email address will not be published.

"We don't see cannibalisation..." "It was five, six years ago we celebrated two million players for the first time," Miles Jacobson tells me, during our lengthy interview with the studio head at Football Manager developer Sports Interactive's office earlier this summer. Checking that reference, it was indeed 2020 when the studio first announced that figure, with some pride. "And then we've really embraced the subscription platforms…" Those platforms - Xbox Game Pass, PS Plus, Apple Arcade, Netflix and more - have had a marked effect on the series. From 2 million players in 2020, the series' playerbase has skyrocketed. "As I sit here today," Jacobson says, in the late summer, "and because I haven't been on social media these numbers haven't been [publicly] updated for a long time, so I'm glad you're sitting down - as of when I last checked, we're at 19.09 million players. Of which, 7.5 million have played for more than five hours. If you play a game for more than five hours, you tend to play for a lot longer." Of those, 2 million people played the game in the month of June alone, Jacobson goes on. "That's for a game that has been out since November 2023." While going through the figures, Jacobson brings up a dashboard on the giant screen he has in his office. Total playtime: 1.7bn hours, for FM24 alone. Average playtime: 118.8 hours, "including all the people that have subscribed and played for an hour and then not come back." Without those, that figure's in the many hundreds. And then the one that stood out the most to me: FM24, as of late this summer, actually had slightly more regular daily players than when it first came out. Two years after release, with no FM25 after that game's shock cancellation and no additional, official updates or data patches to fill the gap, FM24 is effectively bigger than it's ever been. "We have nine times as many players; we have two and a half times the revenue," Jacobson says, before adding quite understandably: "So we're really happy with the partnerships." Those kinds of partnerships have been in the spotlight of late. Back in July, for instance, Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio called Game Pass the "elephant in the room" of the conversation around Xbox parent company Microsoft's large-scale layoffs. He referred to it then as an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit." He added, "I don't think it can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up." The sentiment has some backing - in a continued conversation on X with Michael Douse, director of publishing at Baldur's Gate 3 studio Larian, who broadly echoed those points, Colantonio continued: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does." It all makes for interesting context for Football Manager's huge success, something Jacobson attributes quite directly to subscriptions. FM is a relatively unique series of course, in that it's annualised, has theoretically different audience to 'core' games, and is available on such a wide array of platforms, from PC and consoles to tablets and mobile. Nevertheless, Jacobson says there are specific things the studio has done to ensure its success on subscription services. "We built a whole business model around it," he says. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place." Part of that strategy is in building up what Jacobson called a "long-term addressable audience". In other words: those players who play the game for more than five hours. Essentially they become a kind of insurance against subscription revenue suddenly going away. "If the platforms decided they didn't want us anymore, we would know that we have a lot more consumers to talk to," Jacobson explains. As for that revenue, the specifics of the deals these kinds of platforms make with publishers and developers are quite heavily guarded, but Jacobson could speak broadly to how that worked - how, for instance, does getting nine times more players in a game like Football Manager equate to 2.5 times the revenue, when the games don't include any real in-game microtransactions for those extra players to spend on? "Different platforms work in different ways," he says. "Some of them work in a world of up-front fees and royalties. Some of them work in a way of royalties. Those royalties are different for different platforms, so some are based on eyeballs, some are based on playtimes… So what Epic does with their free weeks is very different to what Microsoft does with Game Pass, very different to what Apple Arcade does. Which is very different to what Amazon Prime Days do, which is very different to what Netflix does." An extra upside comes "if your sales don't drop," Jacobson adds, meaning a studio such as Sports Interactive gets the revenue from the royalties and revenue from sales of the games they would've always had. "We don't see cannibalisation, which is an absolute key thing. But we work with a publisher that we've worked with for a long time, who happens to own us as well, who understands the nature of annual iterations." The studio also has a five-year plan, Jacobson says, and publisher Sega its own 10-year plans, which factor in the timing for when certain deals might run out. "We know when our deals are going to run out with these platforms," Jacobson says. "If we can get a deal that makes sense for us, then we will do the deal that makes sense. If we don't… we know how many customers have played for more than five hours, so we know what our target number is going to be to hit that year. So it actually helps us, being able to be in a - I can't say fully 'no-lose' situation - but in most cases we're in a no-lose situation." All that has left Jacobson almost unanimously positive about the services, at least in terms of how they've worked for Football Manager. "We'd love to stay with the partners, we work very, very well together, and it's massively increased our audience - but I don't control their businesses, and with any large business they can pivot, so we've protected ourselves from that, and that's why it was so important to do that long-term plan first." As for that painfully protracted wave of layoffs, Jacobson put much of the industry's difficulty down to games' increasing competition for attention: "We are in the middle of a battle for eyeballs." "We are not just battling time for other games," he adds. "We're also battling for the time of people watching TV, people watching YouTube, music, videos - games are battling with streamers over eyeballs, because there's only one set of eyeballs. It all ties into the same thing… you have games like ours that have huge playtime. You have games like Candy Crush or Clash Royale, but also games like Destiny that have huge, huge playtimes, and we've seen a lot more of those coming through." All of those games, he goes on, "are battling against everything else. Plus there are more games coming out now than there've ever been before. Literally thousands of games coming out each month. Not everything can survive. So the subscription platforms are part of it, but the whole market is part of it as well." Likewise, he adds, "you have to be realistic about the situation, which is: if there aren't enough hours in the day for the games to be played, then there are games that aren't going to be able to be made. That's the reality, in my opinion, of what people have been going through the last few years… I think people probably realised there's just too many games coming out, they can't all be successful. And the budgets have gone up so much - budgets have gone up exponentially - so you have to sell a lot more than you had to sell five years ago to have a hit game. So it's a perfect storm." That ultimately comes back to Jacobson and the team's five- and ten-year plans - something which might insulate Football Manager as a series more than other games from the "infinite money" concerns raised above. "We've got my COO, we've got the comms team, we've got the finance team, we've got the BI team, and we've got the whole of Sega that we worked with to agree on that long-term plan," Jacobson says. "And then I ruined it all by not releasing FM25."

Title: Artists are losing work, wages, and hope as bosses and clients embrace AI

Time Published: 2025-09-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
After the launch of ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom in Silicon Valley in late 2022, it was mere months before OpenAI turned to selling the software as an automation product for businesses. (It was first called Team, then Enterprise.) And it wasn’t long after that before it became clear that the jobs managers were likeliest to automate successfully weren’t the dull, dirty, and dangerous ones that futurists might have hoped: It was, largely, creative work that companies set their sights on. After all, enterprise clients soon realized that the output of most AI systems was too unreliable and too frequently incorrect to be counted on for jobs that demand accuracy. But creative work was another story. As a result, some of the workers that have been most impacted by clients and bosses embracing AI have been in creative fields like art, graphic design, and illustration. Since the LLMs trained and sold by tech companies have ingested countless illustrations, photos, and works of art (without the artists’ permission), AI products offered by Midjourney, OpenAI, and Google can recreate images and designs tailored to a clients’ needs at rates much cheaper than hiring a human artist. The work will necessarily not be original, and as of now it’s not legal to copyright AI-generated art, but in many contexts, a corporate client will deem it passable—especially for its non-public-facing needs. This is why you’ll hear artists talk about the “good enough” principle. Creative workers aren’t typically worried that AI systems are so good they’ll be rendered obsolete as artists, or that AI-generated work will be better than theirs. Their fear is that clients, managers, and even consumers will deem AI art “good enough” as the companies that produce it push down their wages and corrode their ability to earn a living. (There is a clear parallel to the Luddites here, who were skilled technicians and clothmakers who weren’t worried about technology surpassing their skill, but the way factory owners used it to make cheaper, lower-quality goods that drove down prices.) Sadly, this seems to be exactly what’s been happening, at least according to the available anecdata. I’ve received so many stories from artists about declining work offers, disappearing clients, and gigs drying up altogether, that it’s clear a change is afoot, and that many artists, illustrators, and graphic designers have seen their livelihoods impacted for the worse. And it’s not just wages. Corporate AI products are inflicting an assault on visual arts workers’ sense of identity and self-worth, as well as their material stability. As with translators, the subject of the last installment of AI Killed My Job, there’s a widespread sense that AI companies are undermining a crucial pillar of what makes us human; our capacity to create and share art. Some of these stories, I will warn you, are very hard to read—to the extent that this is a content warning for descriptions of suicidal ideation. All, I think, help us better understand how AI is impacting the arts and the visual arts industry. A sincere thanks to everyone who wrote in and shared their stories. “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing,” as the from SF author Joanna Maciejewska memorably put it, “not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” These stories show what happens when it’s the other way around. A quick note before we proceed: Soliciting, curating, and editing these stories, as well as producing them, is a time-consuming endeavor. I can only do this work thanks to readers who chip in $6 a month, or $60 a year—the cost of a decent cup of coffee, or a coffee table book, respectively. If you find value in it, and you’re able, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription. I would love to expand the scope and reach of this work. Many thanks, and onward. Edited by Mike Pearl. ﻿I work in the field of constructing costumes for live entertainment: theater, film/TV, ballet/opera, touring performers, etc. Budget and scale is all over the map, from low-budget storefront theater in which one person designs and secures costumes for a production, up to a big-budget Broadway spectacular, which can have a dozen people on the design team alone and literally hundreds of makers creating the costumes from designs developed by the design team. I’m seeing this happen typically on the low-budget to midrange end—community theater/high school theater, independent film, etc.: Producers and directors eliminating the position of costume designer in favor of AI image generation. It comes up often in professional forums in the field, someone will share the AI generated costume “designs” and they will be literally impossible to construct for an actual human with materials available in the actual world—gravity-defying materials on pornographically cartoon bodies, etc. -Rachel E. Pollock I remember reading about the new stage of generative AI engines sometime in late 2022 in the NY Times, and seeing Dall-E and Midjourney's outputs and knowing it will mean trouble. Until then AI was making laughable 'art.' Really bad stuff. But all of a sudden the engines had leveled up. I have been working in the comics and publishing industry for over 20 years, but the majority of my income was usually coming from work with advertising agencies. Whenever they needed to present an idea to a client I would come in and help with illustrations, and sometimes storyboards, this was all internal and would never be published, but it was still great to get paid for doing what I love most—drawing. I felt appreciated for my skills and liked working with other people. It was in 2023 that It seemed like overnight all those jobs disappeared. On one of my very last jobs I was asked to make an illustrated version of an AI generated image, after that, radio silence. I had my suspicions that AI was the culprit, but could not know for sure, there was also a general downturn in the advertising industry at the time. Finally I reached out to one of the art directors I work with and he confirmed that the creatives are using AI like crazy, there was no aspect of shame in presenting an AI illustration internally, no one would call you out on it, and it's sure as hell cheaper than using an illustrator. I had to deal with a sudden, very scary decrease in income. Meanwhile it felt like AI slop was mocking me from every corner of the internet, and every big company was promoting their new AI assistant. I was just disgusted with all these corporations jumping on the AI bandwagon not thinking of what the outcomes could be. and additionally, there was the insult of knowing that the engines were trained on working illustrators, including mine! I used my free time to work on a new graphic novel, and eventually leaned into more comics work, which paid (a lot) less, but at least felt more creatively satisfying. The two years following the loss of work were difficult, definitely felt like the rug was taken out from under my feet, and I'm still adjusting to the new landscape, although I feel better about where I am now, I work harder than ever before, for less money. But at least the work will be seen by readers. I'm hoping that in the world of comics the public shame of replacing an artist with AI will hold off the use of the technology, but I'm sure that one day it will become a lot more accepted. I feel like we live in an age where technological changes are happening too rapidly, and are not in any way reined in by the government, and humans can lose their job in the drop of a hat, with no sense of security or help. We are just not built for these fast changes. I'm happy to see people sobering up to the downside of this technology, and hoping the hype would die down soon. -Anonymous I've been out of work for a while now. I made children's book illustrations, stock art, and took various art commissions. Now I have several maxed out credit cards and use a donation bin for food. I haven't had a steady contract in over a year. two weeks ago, when a client who has switched to AI found out about this he gave me $50 out of "a sense of guilt." Basically pity for the fact that Illustrator, as a job, does not exist anymore. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore.The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. I feel cheated, like if I could go back in time and tell the younger me in high school that all the practice, all the love, and all the hope from your parents and friends for your future gets you is carpal tunnel and poverty, I could have gone into a better job field. I'd be an electrician or welder. I have a resume with skills that are appealing to no one, as slop can be generated for free. I sold my colored pencils and markers and illustration tablet on Facebook marketplace for a steal once a previous client who I considered a friend boasted on LinkedIn that AI was the future of cost reduction above an image of a man in a suit who looked like him with six fingers holding a wad of cash. I have applied to over one thousand jobs and I stopped keeping track. My disability didn’t effect making art, but makes me a poor candidate for much else. It was my birthday recently and I sincerely considered not living anymore. The worst part of all is that the parents who once supported me fully in being an artist sent me an AI generated picture of a caricature of themselves holding a birthday cake with my name spelled incorrectly. My friends all post themselves as cartoons online. The person I married had a secret file on their computer labeled "AI pics" they thought I didn't notice. I will wither away eating stale food from the garbage while everyone else is complacent with the slop generator doing what I used to put passion into and finely detail. I don't think it's going to get better. -Anonymous1 I have taught various graphic courses but overwhelmingly Photoshop, the 800 lb. gorilla of the graphics world. I am not a photographer and I do not teach people to take photos, but to manipulate them, also known as Photo Imaging. They are done by manually placing several images into a composite, and then enhancing them by various digital techniques such as layering, blending, masking etc. to arrive at a final result. Most people who take my classes don’t necessarily want to do all that I do, but want to know how to correct or otherwise manipulate photos to create their own projects. I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence and Photoshop’s version, Firefly, my teaching and private tutoring have pretty much dropped dead. There is very little incentive for people to learn these techniques when they can conjure up an image by text prompts. It takes virtually no skill to do this besides the ability to read and write. I have played around with A.I. for personal projects, with varying degrees of success. Some of it is amazing, and some of it is laughable. However, there is no escaping the reality that these models were trained on existing artwork already online. It’s essentially plagiarism on steroids. Also known as theft. Not to mention the obscene energy costs involved. Had this happened to me 20 years ago I would have been devastated. But at this point in my life (I’m 71) it is not as important as it once was. I’ve had some success both in client work and also creating digital art pieces for which I’ve won accolades. I’ve found satisfaction in teaching but now I’m turning more to “natural media” (non-digital) art, specifically painting. I am developing a course to teach watercolor painting to adults and I’m quite excited by this prospect. I have been married over 50 years and we have never relied on my income to survive. -Susan Oakes I worked in the video game industry, as a 3D artist. In early 2023, when AI image generation was hitting the mainstream, I was working as a temporary contractor at a large games and technology company. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there.” I have not been able to find any work since then. Our boss was very enthusiastic about AI image generation, and he showed us how he was using AI to generate some of the textures for the game. I realized that if AI image generation didn't exist, then the company would have needed to hire an extra artist to do that work. I could have recommended a dozen colleagues who were looking for work at the time. It felt like AI was directly taking money out of artist's pockets, and allowing the companies to keep it all. When my contract with that company ended, I did an exit interview with my boss. I expressed concerns about being able to find further work. He handwaved me, saying "There's always work out there." I have not been able to find any work since then. There were several factors as to why there were so many layoffs in games and technology in 2023-2024, but I know that AI has played a role. I miss working as a 3D artist. -Anonymous I am a freelance 3D/2D Generalist. Over the past decade plus, I've had a recurring gig of being hired as a contractor to help create supplemental graphics and B-roll for various documentary-style programs. Everything from infographics about military tanks to 3D animations of prehistoric creatures to recreations of scenes involving historical figures. If you've ever watched any History show, you know the format: footage of the host and experts speaking, then sometimes video clips or photographs, and then typically animated content that illustrates the points the speaker is making. That final category was, until recently, made by people like me. That market has completely dried up. My job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. A couple of years ago, as soon as demos of AI-generated video began to appear, there were almost immediate rumblings that the specific business of creating documentary-style graphics would be disrupted. The logic being that, while the public might reject a feature-length AI-slop theatrical film, the at-home audience for shows about military history or ghosts or aliens might be less-discerning. That theory is now being tested. History Channel is currently airing a season of "Life After People" that heavily features AI-generated visuals, and I'm sure there are more shows in the pipeline being made the same way. We'll see how audiences respond. As much as I would like to say viewers will reject the AI style and demand a return to human-made art, I'm not convinced it will happen. Even if it did, it might soon be too late to turn back. I know that there are studios with expert producers, writers, and showrunners with decades of experience in this exact genre who are closing their doors. That institutional knowledge will be gone. That's probably the bigger point: this trend is not only affecting artists like me, but also the types of companies I contract for. Obviously I lament my own loss of those stable gigs, but my job loss is merely a side-effect of AI killing off studios higher up the chain that each represent dozens more people being put out of work. -Anonymous I work as a freelance illustrator (focusing on comics and graphic novels but also doing book covers or whatever else might come my way) and as a "day job" I do pre-press graphic design work for a screen printing and embroidery company in Seattle. Because of our location, we handle large orders (sometimes 10k shirts at a time) for corporate clients—including some of the biggest companies in the world (Microsoft, Amazon, MLB, NHL, etc.) and my job is to create client proofs where I mock up the art on the garment and call out PMS colors as applicable. I also do the color separations to prepare the art file for screen printing. [H]e instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. When AI first came on the scene, I was approached by a potential client that was self-funding a mobile game and wanted to commission me to create in-game art. He asked what my standard rate was and then offered to double it if I allowed him to pay in etherium (which I knew nothing about at that point.) I immediately had some concerns, but I'm a struggling artist so I took the gig anyway and crossed my fingers. He then introduced me to generative AI and encouraged me to use it to create game content quickly. At first I was interested in the possibility of using it to reduce my workload by maybe generating simple elements I get tired of painting—like grasses or leaves—but he instructed me to start plugging in the names of living artists to generate entire artworks in their style and the first time I did it I realized how horrifyingly wrong this actually was. After that I resisted and tried to use my own art. He grew frustrated with me pretty quickly and I left the company after less than 2 weeks (I was never paid; he owes/owed me about $1300).` Since then, I have been very outspoken against generative AI and haven't touched it again. I was the moderator for a very large group of children's book illustrators (250k members) and I helped institute and enforce a strict AI ban within the group. While this was mostly a positive thing, there were quite a few occasions where legitimate artists were targeted for harassment over accusations of AI use. Some of them were even driven out of the group, in spite of our interventions and assurances that the person was not using AI. In my own freelancing work, I have now been accused of using AI as well. I like to do fan art from Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern [series], and sometimes when I'm looking for work I will post my art and past commissions in fan groups to see if anyone wants to hire me to draw their original characters based on the Pern books. Almost invariably now someone will ask if my art is AI generated. It used to bother me more than it does now, I'm growing a little numb to it. My coworker at my screen printing job (in spite of knowing my negative feelings on the matter because I had cried after I found several dozen pieces of my art in the LAION dataset) chose to plug my art into an AI generator and asked for it to imitate my style—which it did poorly, might I add. It felt extremely violating. Lastly, in my role as a graphic designer, we often now have to deal with clients sending art files in for screen printing that were generated with AI. It's a pain in the ass because these files are often low-resolution and the weird smudgy edges in most AI images don't make for easy color separations. When a human graphic designer sits down to create a design, they typically leave layers in place that can be individually manipulated and that makes my job much easier. AI flattens everything so I have to manually separate out design elements if I want to independently adjust anything. The text is still frequently garbled or unreadable. The fonts don't actually exist so they can't easily be matched. These clients are also almost invariably cheap, and get upset when they're told that it's going to be a $75 per hr art charge to fix the image so it's suitable for screening. Also, and here I don't have any data, just my personal anecdotal experience, but it feels like some of these companies have laid off so much of their in-house graphic design staff that they are increasingly reliant on us as a print service to fix up stuff they'd formerly done for themselves. I get simple graphic design requests every day by people who should have had the resources to handle this themselves but now they're expecting me to pick up the slack for the employees they've let go for the sake of our working relationship and keeping them on as clients. It's become such a drag on our small business that my boss is considering extra fees. (Which, considering the slim margins in the garment industry, is really saying something!) I am convinced Microsoft does not have any in-house graphic designers left at this point. Okay I joke, but man, it's bleak. I have no way of knowing how many gigs I've lost to AI, since it's hard to prove a negative. I'm not significantly less busy than I was before, and my income hasn't really changed for better or worse. There's more stress and fear, greater workloads cleaning up badly-done AI-generated images on behalf of people looking for a quick fix, instead of getting to do my own creative stuff. And it felt deeply and profoundly cruel to have my life's work trained on without my consent, and then put to use creating images like deepfakes or child sexual abuse materials. That one was really hard for me as a mom. I'd rather cut my own heart out than contribute to something like that. There's a part of me that will never forgive the tech industry for what they've taken from me and what they've chosen to do with it. In the early days as the dawning horror set in, I cried about this almost every day. I wondered if I should quit making art. I contemplated suicide. I did nothing to these people, but every day I have to see them gleefully cheer online about the anticipated death of my chosen profession. I had no idea we artists were so hated—I still don't know why. What did my silly little cat drawings do to earn so much contempt? That part is probably one of the hardest consequences of AI to come to terms with. It didn't just try to take my job (or succeed in making my job worse) it exposed a whole lot of people who hate me and everything I am for reasons I can't fathom. They want to exploit me and see me eradicated at the same time. -Melissa I’m a South African illustrator and designer with 20 years of experience, and in my industry, I saw things going pear-shaped even before gen AI hit the scene. One the main places I get jobs from is on Upwork (one of those gig type work platforms), and I’ve noticed a couple of things: A decrease in job offerings for the illustration I typically do (like book covers). I’ve also noticed a lot more job offers to “fix” an AI generated cover. These authors offer less money because of “the work is pretty much done” attitude. Since Upwork added an AI function to help potential employers write their briefs, there’s been a surge in what I’m pretty sure are fake jobs. The job listings all sound very samey obviously because of the format the ai uses, and the employers have no history on the platform of ever having hired anyone and don’t have their phone or bank linked. So I think what might be happening is that some evil person/persons are creating fake accounts and posting fake jobs so that their competitors waste credits applying for these jobs. -Roxane Lapa I got my start on deviantart, moved on to furaffinity and various other websites. I used to take commissions in the furry fandom drawing futa furries with big fat tits and dicks. In the past year or two my commissions have all but dried up, in the time it can take me to do the lineart for an anthropomorphic quokka's foreskin, someone can just go onto one of a dozen websites and knock something of tolerable quality out in no time at all. AI has ruined a once sacred artform. -Anonymous I am the creative team manager for an e-commerce based company. I manage the projects of 2 videographers, 1 CG artist and 3 graphic designers (including myself).As AI has been getting more and more advanced, our boss (one of the owners) keeps pushing us to use AI to make our images stand out amongst competitors. We have a limited budget, so filming or photographing our products in real environments is difficult. And photoshopping them into stock imagery also takes time. Apparently a 1-hour turn around time per image is not quick enough. Our boss has been going to conferences where he hears and sees nothing but praise for AI created images. How quick it is and how "good" the images look like.So of course he's been pushing us to use this technology. I did tell him that it's going to be a learning curve and to be patient. From Midjourney, to the latest update of Chat GPT, and to Adobe's Firefly. We've been cranking out these partial AI images. The funny part is, A LOT of it still has to be photoshopped together. AI is still not smart enough (yet) to produce accurate images. The products we sell are very particular and even if you feed the AI images of said product, it never gets it 100% right.Our boss didn't believe us so he himself tried it and failed miserably. Despite that, he still reminds us that our jobs will be obsolete and that we have to adapt.Even since we started using AI to improve our images, the turnaround time for listing images remains the same. Though I feel like our boss is waiting for the day to fire and replace my team with AI. -Anonymous As an artist, I thought I was going crazy when it seemed everyone was okay (even enthusiastic) with our work being scraped left and right to build image-generation models. I'm a mom and have a mortgage to pay, so the existential threat to my livelihood caused a lot of sleepless nights to say the least. I have been working in 2D animation for the last 10 years. I'm a background artist, which is unfortunately one of the departments most likely to be hit by gen AI replacement in the animation production pipeline. Of course, there's no reality where gen AI could actually do my job properly as it requires a ton of attention to detail. Things need to be drawn at the correct scale across hundreds of scenes. In many cases scenes directly hook up to each other, so details need to stay consistent—not to mention be layered correctly. But these are things that an exec typically glosses over in the name of productivity gains. Plus, there's already a precedent in which AI was used to produce backgrounds for a Netflix anime. Thankfully, I'm very lucky to work at an artist-run studio that currently appears to avoid the use of AI, so I continue to be employed. My peers who were freelance illustrators or concept artists are not so lucky. I'd say about half of the people I've worked alongside this last decade have left the field (not all because of AI, granted, but the state of the North American animation/games industry is a whole thing right now and AI is not helping). The production I am on currently leverages a lot of stock photos from Adobe Stock. We have a rule in place not to use AI, but some images slip through the cracks. These have to be removed from the finished product because of, I assume, the inability to copyright AI-generated images. An incident happened recently where an AI image almost made it to the very end of the pipeline undetected and wound up disrupting several departments who are on tight submission deadlines. We aren't typically paid overtime unless approved by the studio beforehand, so it's likely that unpaid labor (or ghost hours, where you don't tell anyone you worked overtime) went into fixing this mess AI created. I was running research on [Adobe’s] stock marketplace, trying to understand how customers were adopting the new Gen A.I. tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. Internally Adobe was launching their own text-to-image A.I. generator called Firefly but it hadn’t been announced. I was on the betas for Firefly and Generative Fill (GenFill) for Photoshop and ran workshops with designers on the Firefly team. I tested the new tooling internally and gave feedback on Adobe Slack channels and their ethics committee. A.I. generated content started to flood the Adobe Stock website as stock contributors quickly switched from adding and uploading photos to prompting and creating assets with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly and then selling them back on Adobe Stock. Users wanted a better search experience but it was never explicitly clear if they wanted more A.I. slop, although Reddit forums indicated otherwise. During the GenFill beta, I raised concerns about model bias after prompting the model to edit an image of then president Joe Biden across racial categories and having the model return a Black man with cornrows—without taking into account relevant and contextual surrounding information in the image. The ethics committee pointed me to a boilerplate Word doc with their guiding principles and we had a short Microsoft Teams call, but there wasn’t any real concern from their end. After raising additional red flags inside an Adobe Slack channel about Photoshop’s GenFill beta possibly being used to create misinformation at scale the main response I got was a blasé “Photoshop, making misinformation since 1990…” Long story long, the people internally working on these products really don’t care. In another company all hands meeting about text-to-vector capabilities fellow workers shared thoughts and concerns on the impact of AI tooling to the livelihoods of artists, illustrators and other designers in the Teams chat and no one cared. In another meeting when asked about artist’s rights a manager quipped “In the research from AdobeMAX (Adobe’s annual conference) someone said they were willing to sell their ‘artistic style’ for around the price of a car” when gathering data around AI-style mimicry and trust. The Firefly model still struggled to render hands and certain objects with difficulty and an Adobe company wide email sent to all employees encouraged us to sign up for an upcoming photoshoot on a green screen, holding things like trumpets, accordions, rubber chickens and asked employees to make awkward expressions like being surprised with “mouth open” or squinting while putting your finger in your ear in exchange for a free lunch. Some time in 2023 Adobe paid for photographers to document crowds of people during a concert in Seattle and had attendees sign waivers releasing their likeness since Firefly had trouble rendering and distinguishing people in crowds. Shortly thereafter I was told my staff role was being eliminated. They didn’t let me switch teams. They gave me six weeks to find a new job inside the company and six weeks of severance pay. During the six weeks of “offboarding” as they called it I applied to dozens of internal jobs at Frame.io and other teams like Acrobat within the company and it never went anywhere. -Anonymous I just graduated in June from a two-year intensive vocational program in graphic design. It's probably still too early in my job search for me to say that AI "killed my job," but my classmates and I, as well as students from the class just ahead of us, are certainly struggling to find work. Why I wanted to reach out, though, is to share what my experience was as a student studying design in the midst of the peak years of this AI hype. Basically our entire second-year curriculum in one of our five classes, which was previously focused on UX, UI, web design, etc, transitioned to being largely generative AI-focused. I don't think I'm overstating matters to say that no one in my class was happy about this; none of us decided to go (back) to school for design to learn Midjourney or Runway. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? [One instructor] has lived through and had his career significantly impacted by past shifts in the industry (he was a full-time web designer when platforms like Squarespace came along), so my charitable read is that he wants to prepare us for a lifetime of learning new tools to stay employable. I think the faculty in our program are also hearing from alumni and their technical advisory board that AI tools are becoming more important for local companies (we live in a pretty tech-centric city). So while he's sympathetic, I guess, he's still choosing to go all-in on AI, and to push his students to do the same. In our other classes, AI use was varied. Some of our instructors allowed it; a couple still forbid it completely. I came out of school feeling like... I guess I'm grateful to know what's out there, for the sake of my own employability in this really awful job market. I really feel for designers whose school days are a little further behind them. It's not just AI that makes me say this—in fact, even if things like image and video generators find a more permanent place in graphic arts careers, they're changing fast enough that whatever we learned in school is likely to be outdated pretty quickly. If all the angry posts I see on LinkedIn from more senior designers are any indication, there's been a trend in hiring for a while of companies looking for a designer who also does video, animation, UX/UI, and many other things that aren't really graphic design. Our program taught us a lot of those skills, so maybe, if the current economic circumstances improve, our class might be okay. But it makes me worry a lot for our future. Is it always going to be like this? I love learning, but am I always going to feel like I need to acquire skills in at least five new expensive SAS platforms to survive? Even our AI-booster instructor told us over and over again that computers will never replace the need for creative design thinking and empathy. That, he said, is what we should lean into to distinguish ourselves and ensure our employability. But there are only so many positions out there for art directors, and not everyone who studies design wants to do that. Production design gets looked down on as "menial" by some, I think, but it used to be the pipeline into more senior design positions--and if that goes away, how do new designers even get into the field? And what about people who have worked in production their whole lives? -Anonymous I am a freelancer of a few trades, so it can be hard to measure lost work, because I can also wonder if I'm slow because times are slow, or a typical cycle, or AI. I can tell you this: ALL my "lighter" graphic design work—making social media or print ad graphics, designing logos—has totally dried up. I was actually more worried about this when Canva came out, but even then they wanted my eye and my touch on things, so having the tools to do it themselves didn't really deter people from hiring me. I did this kind of work for some local small businesses, organizations, event venues. This was an abrupt change within the past couple years. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" […] are in the bones of the art. My illustration work is mostly picture books, and while my work has remained steady (I do 1-3 a year), the number of inquiries I've gotten from new authors has dropped to nearly zero, when I used to field a few a month and usually book myself out for the next year. Also, through Upwork and other various avenues I find work, I've had quite a few people (presumably authors) reach out to me to "fix" their AI generated art. It does depend on the task at hand but it's a 90% certainty that fixing the art will take nearly as long as just doing it myself. Of course they aren't coming to me with AI generated work because they intended to hire a full-blown illustrator. They are usually thinking they will pay for a couple hours of my time, when what they are asking for could require maybe 100 hours. The "mistakes" AI makes on art for something like a picture book, which requires consistency of a lot of different elements across at minimum 16 or so pages, are so deep that they are in the bones of the art. It's not airbrushing out a sixth finger; it's making the faux colored pencil look the same across pages, or all the items in a cluttered room be represented consistently from different angles, or make the different characters look like they came from the same universe. It's bad at that stuff and it's not surface level. A lot of time potential clients don't know why the art isn't working and it's because it's these all-encompassing characteristics. -Melissa E. Vandiver The title for this story comes from the heading of the email this author submitted. Hopefully, as the bubble bursts, the quality of these outputs will plateau, and people will realize it was all slop to begin with. It’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with soulless bunch of pixels and even just putting them in the same category. The point of art, no matter the category-even something as simple as corporate illustration, is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can feel the quirks, the struggle and the love in every piece or at the very least the personality of the artist. And that’s what makes art unique and human. No doubt AI art can be beautiful, after all it’s modelled on top of some of the best human art ever produced. But to me, it will always feel like you know when you’re taking a photo of the sunset or the moon with your phone and it never looks right? Those photos never compares to actually standing beneath it and taking the moment in with the sight. Both can impress, sure, but only one is able to make us feel something in our bones. And that’s what AI art will never be able to do for me As a medical transcriptionist, I went through the same story in the early 2000s when speech recognition software became a thing. I went from making good money, to training the speech engines, to being paid a pittance to edit SR-generated text, to leaving the field and having to reinvent myself - at 56. I finally retired because I was making less reviewing medical records full-time as an independent contractor than I would with Social Security, even retiring early. Rapid evolution of technology is more than our society is built to handle. Pursuit of insane profits by releasing iffy tech will destroy us from the bottom up. There are now disclaimers in every medical record to the effect that much of the text of reports is generated by speech engines and ***mistakes should be expected/can occur***. JFC. Oh, sorry the engine said 50 mg instead of 15 mg of drug and your dad died as a result. Whoopsie. No posts Ready for more?
