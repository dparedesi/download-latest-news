The practitioners of Hasbara are desperately ratcheting up their control of American corporate and social media and are reportedly seeking funding from the Arab Gulf states to help. The MAGA/MIGA conflict that is splitting Trump’s Republican coalition is one factor stressing zionist narrative control, but fundamentally fallout from Gaza is driving the desperation. The increasingly precarious state of the AI bubble that’s been propping up Silicon Valley and the entire American economy is putting more pressure on the financial underpinnings of Hasbara, Inc. Holocaust Education Sending Wrong Message? Former Obama, Clinton, Kerry and Gore speechwriter Sarah Hurwitz perhaps spoke more truth than she meant to when speaking (video) at the The 2025 General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America. Hurwitz starts with a pretty standard condemnation of 21st Century communications, blaming social media, although it is interesting to note her definition of “mainstream” as not expressing “extreme anti-Israel views.” I think that since October 7th, but really before then, there have been huge shifts in America on how people think about Jews and Israel. And I think that is especially true of young people. So, we are now wrestling with a new, I think, generational divide here. And I think that’s particularly true in that social media is now our source of media. It used to be that the the media you got in America was American media and it was pretty mainstream. It generally didn’t express extreme anti-Israel views. You had to go to a pretty weird bookstore to find global media and fringe media. But today, we have social media, which is a global medium. It is shaped, its algorithms are shaped by billions of people worldwide who don’t really love Jews. And so, while in the 1990s, you know, a young person probably wasn’t going to find Al Jazeera or someone like Nick Fuentes, today those media outlets find them. They find them on their phones. It’s also this increasingly post-literate media, less and less text, more and more videos. So, you have Tik Tok just smashing our young people’s brains all day long with video of carnage in Gaza. And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. So I want to give data and information and facts and arguments and they are just seeing in their minds carnage and I sound obscene. It’s also noteworthy that she does not see video evidence of mass murder as something that should be weighed equally with “facts and arguments.” But the novel thing she said regarded “Holocaust education” which she characterizes as “a very smart bet that made” “in this new media environment” but is now worried that it “may be confusing some of our young people” into thinking that “anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism” and “the lesson of the Holocaust is that you fight Israel.” I’m quoting this section in full because it’s the kind of thing that would have been dismissed as anti-Semitic conspiracy theory if said by Lyndon Larouche in the 1990s. And you know, I think unfortunately the very smart bet that we made on Holocaust education to serve as anti-Semitism education in this new media environment, I think that is beginning to break down a little bit because, you know, Holocaust education is absolutely essential, but I think it may be confusing some of our young people about anti-Semitism because they learn about big strong nazis hurting weak emaciated Jews and they think, ‘Oh, anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism, right? powerful white people against powerless black people.’ So when on TikTok all day long they see powerful Israelis hurting weak, skinny Palestinians, it’s not surprising that they think, ‘Oh, I know the lesson of the Holocaust is you fight Israel. You fight the big powerful people hurting the weak.’ Caitlin Johnstone titled her response “Zionists Are Freaking Out About Losing Control Of The Narrative” and I’ll quote a key passage: It’s just so fascinating to see a former White House speechwriter making so many of the points that anti-Zionists have been making for years, but taking the exact opposite meaning from them. … Hurwitz isn’t denying Israel’s abuses or framing its genocidal atrocities as the problem, she’s just coming right out and saying that people obtaining information and moral clarity about those abuses is the problem. The atrocities aren’t wrong, what’s wrong is people seeing those atrocities and calling them what they are. I love the way she complains that she looks “obscene” for trying to lay out arguments and narratives justifying the Gaza holocaust for people who’ve seen the “wall of carnage” from the genocide. I mean, yes. Yes obviously you’re going to look obscene if you try to tell someone why raw video footage of massacres, mutilated children and emaciated bodies is actually showing something that is justifiable and acceptable. You can’t stand in front of a pile of child corpses justifying their murder and then whine when people ignore your spinmeistering and keep staring at the tiny bodies. That’s like murdering an entire family and then telling the cops, “But you’re not listening to my reasons for killing them!” They’re doing the normal thing while you are being obscene. So yea, there’s that. Now that we’ve set the context and shown the panic driving Israel’s quest for total narrative control, let’s look at some of the tactical aspects of that quest. Taking Hasbara to Church and ChatGPT Haaretz dropped a blockbuster report ten days ago that reveals the aggressive and ambitious nature of Hasbara in 2025: The Israeli government has signed contracts worth millions of dollars in recent months to rehabilitate Israel’s standing in American public opinion, both online and offline. Amid a sharp drop in support from the conservative right, Israel has hired firms to conduct not just “hasbara [public diplomacy] campaigns” but also campaigns targeting millions of Christian churchgoers, bot networks to amplify pro-Israel messages online, and efforts to influence both search results and the responses given by popular AI services like ChatGPT. Among the experts recruited is a former campaign manager for Donald Trump and many of the other firms are linked to the Republican party or Evangelical communities, indicating that Israel is focusing massive efforts on communities once considered automatically pro-Israel. Among the campaigns’ goals is fighting antisemitism, which has risen alongside the decline in support for Israel. Together, these campaigns signal a new phase in Israel’s post-war public diplomacy strategy, and a shift in the way it uses agents – both AI and human influencers – for hasbara abroad. … Payments are routed through Havas Media Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of the international advertising and public relations giant Havas. In practice, Havas serves as an intermediary, executing contracts with U.S. firms on Israel’s behalf. The documents show that since 2018, the company has received at least $100 million to promote Israeli tourism campaigns in the United States and it also works with other countries, including several in the Gulf, on similar projects. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X, owned by Brad Parscale, who played a lead role in Trump’s digital campaigns in 2016 and 2020. The $6 million, four-month contract – signed between his firm and Havas Media on behalf of the Israeli government – calls for “strategic consulting, planning, and communications services to develop and execute a broad U.S. campaign to combat antisemitism.” According to the filing, Parscale’s company will produce “at least 100 core pieces of content per month” – including videos, audio, podcasts, graphics and text – and “5,000 derivative versions” monthly, aiming for 50 million impressions a month. Eighty percent of the content will target young Americans on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Campaign messages will be distributed via Salem Media Network, a conservative Christian media group that owns more than 200 radio stations and websites. Parscale was appointed this year to lead Salem’s strategy. Lucrative work if you can get it and don’t mind a little blood on your fangs hands. The American Conservative has more details on the Salem Media aspect of this caper: Salem Media, one of America’s largest conservative media conglomerates, may have already begun integrating paid-for Israeli government narratives across its extensive network of platforms. The arrangement, formalized through a seven-figure contract, raises significant questions about the intersection of foreign influence on an increasingly fracturing conservative media environment. Salem did not respond to The American Conservative’s request for comment. In September, the Israeli government retained Salem Media’s chief strategy officer, Brad Parscale, to advocate for Israeli interests through a $6 million financial arrangement. The contract filed with the Department of Justice explicitly outlines the “integration of narrative messaging into Salem Media Network properties and aligned distribution channels” as one of its key deliverables. Salem Media operates 82 radio stations across the United States and manages high-profile websites like Townhall and RedState that serve as influential platforms in shaping conservative discourse. Salem also hosts multiple podcasts featuring prominent voices in the conservative movement. Among those programs are The Charlie Kirk Show, The Dinesh D’Souza Podcast, The Josh Hammer Show, and The Right View with Lara Trump. According to company data, the network generates 80 million monthly website page views with 37 million monthly app visits. Salem’s newsletter operation reaches 4 million active subscribers, delivering 310 million newsletters every month, and also touts 44 million “fans” on Facebook. Parscale now serves dual roles: advancing Salem’s business interests while simultaneously working as a registered and compensated foreign agent for Israel. The implications extend to Salem’s roster of prominent commentators, particularly Dinesh D’Souza and Josh Hammer, who have become central figures in an escalating debate within conservative circles about America’s relationship with Israel and role in the Middle East policy more broadly. But Parscale can’t do it all alone. Musk’s X No Longer Translating Hebrew Clearly this is a time to leave no stone unturned for Team Hasbara, so they mopped up an embarrassing detail this week, or maybe Elon Musk did it all on his own out of his sincere concern about anti-Semitism. I’ll let Grok explain: Translation from Hebrew was disabled because it often amplified inflammatory or policy-violating content, like calls for violence, to a global audience via inaccurate or literal renditions. X prioritizes free speech for opinions but limits features that exacerbate harm without… — Grok (@grok) November 16, 2025 As to why Elon Musk might think this was necessary, here’s one example translated from the Hewbrew: pic.twitter.com/yDseDDhbg2 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 TikTok Is Now a Zionist Free Speech Zone While it’s not entirely clear that a new ownership consortium including Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz have completed their takeover of TikTok (based on I don’t believe anything Trump 2.0 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant says and he’s the one saying the deal is done), what is clear is that their new Public Policy Manager, Hate Speech, Erica Mindel is on the J-O-B. Before we look at Mindel’s work, let’s review what’s been reported about the new owners, via Forbes: Software giant Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and MGX, an AI-focused investment firm established by the government of Abu Dhabi, are expected to own around 45% of the new TikTok. Silver Lake also has significant ties to the Gulf States with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. owning 5% of the VC firm. But let’s get back to Erica Mandel and her work at Tik Tok, via Mel the Village Crazy Lady: Remember that time that Congress held a billion hearings on “antisemitism on TikTok” because people were sharing videos from Gaza? Well now that Zionists own the platform, this is what their spaces sound like: https://t.co/cH2hE2pSyK pic.twitter.com/jRJqFT5EUp — Mel (@Villgecrazylady) November 18, 2025 Both videos feature a man identified as “Older Millennial” who is indulging in grossly eliminationist rhetoric like “if we leave a scrap of Palestinian DNA in Gaza…”, “if we destroy everything in Gaza what will be the loss to mankind”, and in the top video he proposed issuing “hunting licenses” to those wishing to murder Palestinians in Gaza. Cleansing Tik Tok of Pro-Palestinian Voices Lest you think Mindel has been idle, since she came on board Tik Tok no longer serves up anything in response to searches for Nick Fuentes, and is “banning users from calling the IDF “terrorists” and rolling out automated moderation that retroactively wipes posts. Users report “Free Palestine” comments disappearing in real time and Israeli war-crimes videos taken down” per Drop Site News. Glenn Greenwald spoke to Guy Christensen, an American advocate for Gaza and Tik Tokker with 3.5 million followers on the platform about the new Hasbara regime on the site. The 19-year-old Christensen explains that prior to October 7, 2023, he was a non-political poster on the platform with over 2 million followers when “my feed was flooded with pro-Israel propaganda dehumanizing Palestinians. And me having no prior knowledge about Israel was shocked. I was disgusted by what I was hearing, not like not knowing anything. And, that shock provoked me to dig into the reality of Gaza.” Christensen was “disenrolled” from Ohio State University in May after completing his freshman year. The univeristy claimed it “received ‘myriad communications’ from ‘members of the university community’ expressing their ‘fear of violence and for their personal safety based on (Christensen’s) social media posts.’ Christensen blames Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic Congressman Richie Torres, among others, for driving his expulsion. The ACLU has taken up Christensen’s cause in a lawsuit. But back to our topic, regarding the new Tik Tok policies Christensen says: They mandate that people have to condemn terrorist groups designated by the US State Department, when mentioned in any videos, even when mentioned in a neutral, investigative context. They opened the door to classifying anti-Israel speech as hate speech based on their new clause about national origin. They ban the reading of manifestos. They restrict videos from the feed that show videos from war, aka Gaza. And so I’ve been forced and other people have been forced to stop showing real footage, real imagery from the destruction of the Palestinian nation in the Gaza Strip. As soon as these uh changes went into effect, my videos started getting banned or removed from the recommendation feed left and right. And to kind of put this into perspective, over the last, you know, almost 2 years before these changes, as I was posting consistently about Palestine every single day, there’s only been a handful of videos that I’ve ever gotten removed. I looked and over the last year prior to September 13th, it was one or two that you could even count. So very quickly (after the new policies were implemented) I racked up about 10 violations either (videos) removed completely without any recourse to appeal or they were shadowbanned. I would get like um 100 views from people who only went directly to my profile to view it and my fellow collaborators fellow people in the movement on TikTok, I reached out to them and they reported back the same exact thing. Many accounts other than Christensen’s, including Breaking Points Krystal Ball, have been throttled, banned, or shadowbanned on Tik Tok since Mindel took over “hate speech” on the platform. No one is even bothering to pretend that Chinese manipulation of the algorithm, the ostensible reason the platform was banned by the U.S. Congress, was really a concern. Rather the Washington Post handwrings about the 17-to-1 preponderance of pro-Palestinian videos vs pro-Israel videos on the platform. The hasbara happens out in the open now. The Ellisons Have Been Busy Hasbara Elves at Paramount Since I last updated about David Ellison (Larry’s nepo-baby) and Paramount, the team has been busy cracking down on free speech. Per Variety: An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. … Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. [Update, Nov. 7: Other sources intimately familiar with Paramount said that while an itemized list does not exist, the management team shares a set of values and has no desire to work with anyone who expresses hate in public and damaging ways]. Bari Weiss’ takeover at CBS News is also getting press, from Puck at the end of October: she has had real discussions about the feasibility of their transfer. Her targets have included Fox News anchors Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer, and Dana Perino, as well as CNN analyst Scott Jennings; and, as I reported earlier this week, she has also discussed expanding Anderson Cooper’s role at the network beyond 60 Minutes. In an industry where talent acquisition has its own set rules of engagement, Bari’s instinctive and freewheeling approach has struck many as unorthodox. To many TV news veterans, it is also seen as a sign of her inexperience and lack of managerial finesse. Network executives lock their talent into yearslong contracts—Anderson’s runs through 2026, Bret’s into 2028, and Dana’s into the 2030s—and include specified negotiation windows that don’t open until the final three to six months of the agreement. Savvier network leaders tend to re-up their stars before that window ever opens. Getting out of these contracts isn’t impossible, of course, but it doesn’t happen on a whim—and it usually requires quite a bit of discretion. The casual, D.I.Y. approach is very on brand for Bari, and presumably one of the reasons that David Ellison brought her in to disrupt the business. In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict. (On Friday, Trump sat down with Norah O’Donnell for his first interview on the network since he sued 60 Minutes.) Paramount Alone Isn’t Enough But Paramount is small beans in the overall media picture, which explains the Ellisons’ drive to acquire WBD (Warner Bros Discovery). Keep in mind, streaming has completely upended the American media business. The lumbering titans that bought up most of the nation’s TV networks and movie studios are getting pwned by Netflix and Alphabet’s YouTube. pic.twitter.com/fqYJtLxYmu — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Let’s hear from The New York Times regarding Paramount’s efforts to acquire WBD: Over the course of four weeks, Paramount made three offers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, ratcheting up the financial stakes of a deal that would reshape the media landscape. … The move essentially kicked off a public frenzy of interest from other potential suitors this week, including Comcast and Amazon. If they bid, that could pressure Paramount to further increase its offer. Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it was initiating a sale because of “the unsolicited interest of multiple parties” for both some parts and all of the company. Paramount’s first bid was for $19 a share, before moving up to $22 in late September. Paramount’s latest bid was delivered on Oct. 13, offering to pay the company’s shareholders $23.50 a share in cash and stock, according to the letter. That offer represented an 87 percent premium to Warner Bros. Discovery’s share price before its intent to make a bid for the company was first reported on in early September. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. shares closed at $20.53. A takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount would be a tectonic shift for the media industry. It would combine two of the largest Hollywood studios, Warner Bros. and Paramount, granting huge clout at the box office and putting CNN and CBS News under the same corporate umbrella, which would give the new company enormous sway over the news industry. It would combine Paramount+ and HBO Max, two of the biggest streaming services, bringing the company’s movies and shows into hundreds of millions of living rooms. According to Variety (in a report which Paramount denies), Paramount is “putting together a $71 billion bid for WBD in conjunction with funds from three Arab countries: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).” Regarding Paramount’s denial, one media insider reports: Sources familiar with the talks say the connections behind that capital did not appear on their own. Ari Emanuel has long standing ties across Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, and he publicly supported Ellison’s previous Paramount effort. Paramount issued a denial, but multiple industry sources confirmed that a holding company structure allows outside capital to participate without ever appearing on Paramount’s balance sheet. I’ve previously posted on Ari Emanuel’s involvement in the Ellisons’ acquisition of Paramount. Yahoo Finance had more on the wheeling and dealing going on in the Trump White House this week while the POTUS is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and cutting some private Trump organization deals of their own): Elon Musk, Tim Cook, golfer Bryson DeChambeau and other notables will join Ellison at a black-tie dinner held in the Saudi royal’s honor, a person familiar with the guest list tells Deadline. Earlier Tuesday, Trump met with Cristiano Ronaldo, the soccer star who recently re-upped his $200 million-a-year contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr. Ronaldo was also on the guest list for the dinner. A Variety report, citing anonymous sources, said a coalition involving Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, had formed in support of a forthcoming $71 billion bid by Paramount for WBD, which would be a notch higher than prior bids in the $60 billion-plus range. Now why would David Ellison need to go to the Gulf States to fund his hasbara? Maybe Daddy’s company Oracle is having some financial issues? Oracle Doesn’t Have Infinite Money CNBC reports that Oracle has lost one third of its market cap since September and is issuing $38 billion in debt to “finance its AI buildout”. Reuters is reporting that investor sentiment on that Oracle debt is bearish: Oracle bonds have taken a hit in recent days following a report that the cloud and artificial intelligence service provider plans to add another $38 billion to its heavy debt load to fund its AI infrastructure, according to analysts and investors. … “What’s interesting is most of the (major tech) companies are trying to sustain their (stock) buyback programs at the same time that they’re spending on capex currently and to do that, they’re actually borrowing and so they’re using debt,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The price of Oracle’s bonds maturing in 2033 with a 4.9% coupon has dipped, pushing yields up more than three basis points over the last two weeks, while the yield on its newer bonds maturing in 2032 with a 4.8% coupon has risen almost two basis points in one week, according to market participants. And The Financial Times put out a doozy of a report asserting that “Oracle’s net debt is already at 2.5 times ebitda, having more than doubled since 2021, and it’s expected to nearly double again by 2030. Cash flow is forecast to remain negative for five straight years.” The piece included several charts, including this particularly brutal one: pic.twitter.com/TTs0b2Q1Hw — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Time will tell if the Ellisons’ hasbara-promoting media empire will grow even larger, but at the moment it appears to be on the proverbial knife’s edge.

And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. Good on the younger Jews. Don’t let the old fuckers gaslight you into believing up is down. I think Nassim Taleb is right about social media being more a return to common sense and a two way debate than the programmed propaganda of traditional media. Ideas and opinions have to stand on their merits and against the opinions of others. People are freer to hold their own views on social media. Ultimately most people are reasonable, and know right from wrong. Essentially, Israel and its foreign assets are freaking out because the heretofore wildly successful color revolution In the US is being challenged. Where’s Waldo? Noting: “In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict.” Hilary. What are you doing in that group? Grifting again? Blabbering about how stupid your Columbia students were? Special cameo appearance, too, by gay icon Tim Cook. Ahhh, role models. Time to throw some to the flames. ” Time to throw some to the flames.” Or, as an unrepentant misogynist I knew once put it: “Time for a good old fashioned Auto da Fem.” Yes, if you want to do “cutting edge” deals, bin Salman is the one to see. The first thing I remember watching about the Jews in WWII when I was pretty young was the TV movie The Wall, which at the time I thought was a dramatic retelling of history, but that I now recognize as hasbara. It came out in 1982, which I’ve come to learn is about the time Israeli propaganda really kicked into high gear. My understanding (and older commenters, please correct me if I’m wrong here) is that before the 70s or so, WWII was looked upon as a great tragedy for the whole world, but not as a war specifically fought to persecute and murder Jewish people. Millions of Jews died, but many millions more Russians and Chinese did too, among others. Plenty of misery to go around. It wasn’t until a few decades after the war that Israel developed the narrative that the war was about them and their special grievances in order to justify allowing the Israeli government to get away with whatever it wanted to with impunity. Yes, Nazi Germany killed millions more of Russians in battle than Jews, but the extermination camps created by the Nazis were primarily intended for Europe’s Jewish population. WWII was not about the Jews, but it is incontrovertible that Nazi Germany attempted to exterminate all of European Jewry. Systematically rounding up a population and sending them by rail to gas chambers for extermination was an atrocity never before seen in war. That said, what Germany did to the Jews in WWII does not excuse Israel for what is has done in Gaza. Don’t forget the gays and the Romani people. They too were Nazi “untermenchen” As well as various “defective” people supposedly polluting the gene pool…. Agreed. War is hell and gives people the excuse to justify atrocities. There are no clean ones fought by ‘the rules’. There were 1 million+ Greeks ethnically cleansed from Anatolia during WWI and that’s not even on most people’s radar, and wouldn’t be on mine if not for some partial Greek heritage. Genocide against Jews in WWII wasn’t the first in history, and the current Zionist entity is proving beyond doubt that it wasn’t to be the last. But the way these various horrific events are referred to in today’s Western society is very different. Those who comprise the Zionist entity which puts out the hasbara Nat discusses, where the problem isn’t the wholesale slaughter of other human beings but the negative PR, are a psychologically damaged people. There’s a lot hanging on the terms “rail” and “gas chambers” in that statement, but it is incontrovertibly true the Nazis would have been quite happy if the Jews had all shipped off to Anywheresville as long as it wasn’t anywhere in Europe. The American genius was to genocide the indigenous populations without recourse to neither rail nor gas but nontheless providing the basic conceptual model for the subsequent Nazi experiment with Slavs, Gypsies and Jews. However, the most successful genocide in European history, ie, no survivors, is that of the Cathars whose frenzied slaughter was led by none other than that champion of the oligarchy as the governing principle of England, and by extension the US, Simon de Montfort, after whom an English university is named. Simon de Montfort, famous for his role in Parliamentary history, was a younger son of the crusader also called, Simon de Montfort. The younger Simon, being a younger son conceded the family’s French seat to his older brother, but received family support for laying at least partial claim to the title and lands of the Earl of Leicester, which the elder had had a claim to through his mother, a Beaumont. Both Simons played a part in the Magna Carta. Simon, the genocidaire and fifth earl of Leicester, was protecting his interests in 1215, and his son, the sixth earl of Leicester, was both a crusading genocidaire in Gascony, like his dad, but his brother-in-law, Henry III, was none too happy about it and, ultimately, after going on another crusade and coming home to a bit of turmoil, defeated Henry in 1264, called parliament in 1265 and promptly got himself killed at Evesham in the same year. Both men, it seems, were rat’s arses who got off on killing people with different beliefs. Very few of the 12 million Soviet civilian victims died in the battles, they were tortured, labored and starved to death unless just executed as an example. They were not collected to camps, just driven inside their churches and burned. In Belarus alone Germans erased over 600 villages completely (with their inhabitants) and partially destroyed over 5000. All and all the number of destroyed villages was over 70,000. The very concept of “lebensraum” included only the raum, not the people leben there at the time. That was only for the “Aryans”. It was a purposeful, genocidal, on-site ethnic cleansing. Under General Plan Ost, the Slavs of the Eastern Front (Poland, Ukraine, Baltics, Russia) were also intended to be exterminated, by a combination of killings, working to death and restricting their food. A small remainder were to be enslaved. In this respect, the concentration and extermination camps were laboratories for a much greater programme of Slavic extermination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost The justification claimed by Israel could be claimed by Poland and the Ukraine and Russia too…. I remember even in the early-mid 80s most WWII programs were more tilted towards the Pacific rather than European theatre. Probably because the US was pretty much solo there. I think it was the xian/born again stranglehold of the 80s that really cemented the zionazi mentality. Afterall, Reagan was a firm believer in jesus returning after jews went back to israel…so the xians can then convert or kill them all. I can’t speak for the 1970s vs. the 1980s, but I do know that by the 1990s a lot of “new” narratives about World War 2 were so entrenched, that anyone going up against them, including unwittingly, was getting blacklisted by both media and academia. Norman Finkelstein (“The Holocaust Industry”) comes to mind, but it wasn’t just hasbara-related; I recommend “History Wars” (from 1996!!) for a great summary of the scandal manufactured around the Smithsonian’s attempt to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings. Meanwhile, this apparently had not been the case in the 1960s, based on what’s in the older history books, e.g. William Shirer’s “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich”. So somewhere between the 60s and the 90s the switch must have gotten flipped. Insofar as the numbers. Nazi Germany was responsible for >20 million civilian and PoW deaths – ~18 million in the Soviet Union, including 3 of the 6 million Holocaust victims (which are hardly ever mentioned in “Holocaust literature”, by the way), plus 3 million of the non-Soviet Holocaust victims, >1 million in Poland, and at least hundreds of thousands if not a million plus in former Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Plus French resistance and the like, so maybe the figure is closer to 25 million. But it’s not just that, it’s the shift in focus. I watched a fascinating lecture a few years ago, where a guy just took the tourist brochures at the Auschwitz museum from different eras, and compared them. The one from the 1950s was a 200 page book (!!), explaining in detail how the Nazis came to power, why they murdered >20 million people, the whole history of the Holocaust specifically, but including how German industrialists profited from it (by working to death those Jews who were not sent to the gas chambers immediately), and on and on and on. The brochure from the 2020s? Three or so large format pages with more pictures than text, the sum of which comes down to – Hitler was evil for the sake of evil, and hated Jews because he hated Jews, and exterminated 6 million of them thusly, the end. Now, it isn’t just the effect of hasbara specifically – but that’s part of it, because if you start describing German settler colonialism, someone is bound to ask the question of how Israel’s settler colonialism is different, aside from specific tactics chosen. To be sure, it isn’t all bad in Thick History Book Land (just more bad than good). But that’s not where the great majority of the populace is, hence TikTok and CBS-WB… Germany in WWII mostly observed the Geneva Conventions with regard to POWs in the West, but embarked on exterminationist policies against the Soviets. At least 1.3 million Soviets held as POWs were murdered quite apart from battle deaths. Cold War propaganda distorted narratives of WWII atrocities in general. The firebombing of Dresden (in the Soviet zone of occupation so the evidence was in Soviet custody) for example “expanded” in Soviet propaganda by an order of magnitude to 200,000 dead. For the Americans, Stalin’s crimes had to be lumped into the common basket of “totalitarianism”. Local complicity and resistance made for morally complex stories coming from France, the Netherlands, fascist Italy and Papal Rome, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and as we are all now aware, Ukraine. I think awareness of the holocaust assumed all of its contradictory parts at least from the last days of WWII, but was layered over with many salient events and retellings, including movies and books and news events. Zionists were sure they had the answer even in the 1930s. The cynical reaction of Norman Finkelstein or John Mearsheimer began to emerge in the late 20th century. Kudos for a great round-up. Timely and important. My pleasure. Been meaning to get back to this topic but Mamdani and the MAGA civil war have been eating up my slots. Ditto Sunshine. Forwarding. Ditto Ditto Much appreciated NWT! Interesting to see the name Havas Media here helping with the Hasbara effort. The current owner, Bolloré, is a far right French industrialist billionaire who’s been accumulating propaganda outlets by buying out and then transforming formerly traditionally center left or left French media over the past decade or so into bilious anti Muslim and far right French Catholic (a huge subject) outlets to manipulate French opinion. The journalists that come with the acquisitions are unionized and fight with the few legal means at their disposal (it’s a strangely regulated profession) until they eventually just quit. Havas itself was built on money generated from the cotton trade, when it was produced by slavery, first in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and after the revolution in Brazil. Dirty money seems to stain permanently. Or in Balzacian terms “Derrière chaque grande fortune se cache un crime”. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X Sure makes me wonder about the Kirk assassination. Curious for it to happen as the hasbara rubber is hitting road. Here in Michigan as in several other states genocide, the Holocaust/ Jewish genocide and Armenian genocide are required to be taught in the public schools. There is a panel to approve the content. I have written those responsible for overseeing this as well as my state legislators as well Congresswoman Tlaib’s office to suggest that the Gaza genocide be added to the program. I received no responses. I managed to get myself blocked from further posting or commenting on Substack, since this; https://johnmerryman.substack.com/p/gods-problems Given my problems are not about politics, ethnicities, or any of the social and cultural branding, but the basic conceptual foundations of Western Civ, in this case, monotheism, I don’t really have a problem with the hasbara, as it is turning the entire media system into used toilet paper and sucking the political flunkies down with it. Ask yourself, is God Spirit, or Authority? They are not synonymous….. Democracy and republicanism originated in pantheistic cultures. And here I was thinking I might be allowed to express myself on substack. Thanks for disabusing me of that fantasy. The hasbara was happening long before the ’80’s. I remember the “making the desert bloom” hasbara coming in the late ’50’s. No mention of Zionists taking inventory of the best farms in Palestine in the ’30’s and ’40’s to be acquired (stolen) after 1948. Historian Illan Pape writes about that from actual records. There was a plan, it was implemented with German efficiency and explained as something else. What was that Goebbels said about repeating a lie frequently enough? a link would be great, I did a quick search and found this but if a person knew a more relevant to comment link that would be better, not a criticism per se, but more the farther down the pilot hole, the easier to set the screw… https://www.stopthejnf.org/the-jnf-the-principal-zionist-tool-for-the-colonization-of-palestine-by-ilan-pappe/ this is from 2023, earlier might be better A useful link might be Leon Uris’ novel, “Exodus,” published in 1958. That was the year I graduated high school and I read it and loved it. So inspiring! “Exodus” the film was released in 1960. Starring …. swoon ….. Paul Newman! One of the most effective propaganda films ever. By the time I graduated college in 1962, most of my friends were seriously considering spending time on Israeli communes, to help make ‘the desert bloom.’ It was decades later that I learned about the 1948 Nakba, the expulsion of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and farms, from the reading I did after 9/11, especially a small book by I.F. Stone. tegnost – here is a link to an excellent overview of “Blaming the Victims”, a book published in 1988 about myths connected to the founding of Israel. https://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/28th-may-1988/28/it-takes-two-to-tell-the-truth My parents were living in the Lebanon at that time, and did volunteer relief work with Palestinian refugees. They met many who had been driven from their homes at gunpoint. They were surprised to get home and hear that the Nakba happened because Arab leaders had broadcast instructions to Palestinians to flee their homes. That’s one of the myths addressed in the essay. It may be that since the Zionists took over Tik Tok, that it will just become another Bluesky meaning an echo chamber which the kids will just abandon. There may even be lingering resentment by those kids how their Tik Tok was taken off them and just become another Hasbara outlet courtesy of the government. The Zionists may have taken over CBS News too but when you get down to it, how many kids gets their info from CBS News in the first place? I would have figured their audience to be a much older cohort. So what will the Zionists do? Sure they will try to make all those atrocity videos be disappeared down a Memory Hole but I would not be surprised if they eventually tried to convince people that all those atrocity videos are just AI videos and that nothing ever happened. It’s all the work of Hamas don’tcha know? The civilization gods are bigger than the tribal gods. Even if the tribal gods ruled for hundreds of thousands of years and the civilization gods for only the least several thousand. The Golden Rule is a better long term strategy than Kill all the Amaleks, because what goes round, comes round. This is close to my thinking on how this will play out. The fact the Israeli system and friends are resorting to it while otherwise digging a deeper hole adds to a theory of mine: When the Israelis got a Jewish state, most of them rapidly traded in the proverbial “yiddishe kop”. On a related note, I think there’s an even deeper reason it won’t work, and I’ve been surprised that nobody else seems to have expressed it yet. For several reasons, I don’t post much on Gaza and Israel, but I think almost everyone is misdiagnosing why youth support for Israel, especially in the US, is collapsing. Gaza has definitely accelerated things, and also stripped away much of the Jewish claim to special treatment after the Holocaust. But the clouds could part tomorrow, the Palestinians and Israelis could make peace, with everything between them forgiven… and all but the most clueless younger American would carry on a simmering ill will towards Israel. Gaza is not the prime mover. The deeper rupture is only now presenting openly, still jumbled up and expressed in inchoate ways, but to put it simply, a blood debt has been incurred. America vis-a-vis Israel, regardless of how Israel justifies it in its own interests. This has nothing to do with anti-Semitic bigotry (though some will make tactical alliances and unfortunately many may drift into it). All one has to do is look at any American political issue in my lifetime that touched on “our future”, then ask which side the Israeli body politic actively enabled. New owners trying to buy up or cut down media channels as quick as they spring up is Sisyphean enough. Beyond any platform though, people in this country will keep the score in their own lives, and all but the most irredeemable suckers will conclude that Israel treats the average American as an enemy. And someday America will return the favor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnJucRfS_ig Nah man, my mom’s on woowoo. Why would Arab states want to fund hasbara? And famously, Smotrich said it might be moral to starve 2 million Palestinians. That might sound unfriendly, but don’t you dare compare him to that moustache guy. He only said 2 million instead of 6 million, so it’s not the same thing at all. https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/middleeast/israeli-minister-smotrich-starve-gazans-intl/ Kind of in the same spirit, I can’t help but notice how much Matt Taibbi seems to have realized who his (heftily paying audience – at least for Substack – $10/month!) really is. https://www.racket.news/p/the-jeffrey-epstein-story-is-beginning So now the whole Epstein affair is another Russiagate. Whatever keeps those new right-wing subscribers clicking and paying, I guess? Of all these, I think the TikTok thing will be most effective. I’d guess that very few young ‘uns will dump TikTok over this as it won’t affect their main usage needs (dances or whatever they are up to). So TikTok will continue, just without informing the kids about the Zionist genocide. Sure, some will follow it by other means but a lot will just slip back into ignorance. I’d love to be wrong about this. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Full Content:
Kyle Butler eats, sleeps, and breathes tattooing. The Aurora-born artist and entrepreneur has been collecting ink since he gave himself his first stick ’n’ poke at age 14 (it was the Deathwish Skateboards logo). A week after his 18th birthday, he moved to Chicago to study creative writing at Columbia College and soon began home tattooing. Two years later, he dropped out to devote himself to what had become a full-blown obsession. Now 33, he’s the sole owner of the Irving Park street shop Red Devil Tattoo, which he started with Miranda Larson in 2021, and also runs a private, appointment-only studio nearby. As tattooing moved from an underground industry to a “legitimate” trade in the late 20th century, home tattooing became frowned upon by the broader professional community. But many artists—including many industry trailblazers—had started as so-called “scratchers.” Over the past decade, home tattooing has experienced something of a renaissance thanks to the wide availability of single-use needles (an industry standard since the early 2000s) and home tattoo machines, along with the ubiquity of social media as a tool for learning and self-promotion. Butler embodies a shop owner who came from the modern underground. He remains excited about how reduced barriers to entry have led to fresh styles and ideas in tattooing. At the same time, he encourages a reverence for tattoo history and an investment in the craftsmanship (such as learning to build one’s own machines) that’s often lost to younger artists. To Butler, tattooing isn’t a trade, it’s a lifestyle—and he can’t imagine any other. I tattooed myself when I was 14. Then I got a tattoo in Indiana when I was 16 because you can get tattooed underage in Indiana, so we just drove over the [Illinois] border. Once I turned 18, I was getting tattooed all the time. I like getting tattooed. There’s something primal about it. No matter where you come from or who your ancestors are, at one point, they were tattooing themselves or marking their bodies or decorating [them]. Tattooing can be really transformative because it’s both immediate and permanent. You walk into a place one way and you walk out different. At 18, I had no inkling I was going to tattoo. I just knew I was obsessed. There’s all these ways you should go about [becoming a tattooer]: Get an apprenticeship, train, have a mentor, etc. I was way too antsy and maybe anti-authority for that. I just had to do it, so I started tattooing my friends. I dropped out of Columbia in 2015. I really liked school—like really, really—but tattooing kind of overtook all my time and energy. I lived at a big, shitty punk house with a million people; I paid, like, $200 a month in rent and split a room. That’s where a lot of my practice came: There’d be some punk band on tour who’d want to get tattoos after the show, so we’d stay up all night partying and tattooing. When I started, I wasn’t thinking of it as a hobby or a career. It felt more like a lifestyle. I just knew that I was gonna be into tattoos forever. If I was making money, if I wasn’t—there was no way I’d stop. I slowly started to get better and meet helpful people. I started to travel a lot, too. I was doing guest spots at different shops across the country. I did a couple really long trips where I packed all my tattoo stuff in my car and drove from, like, Chicago to LA, stopping and tattooing where I could—[working at] random shops where I had a friend from the Internet or a punk house where I knew people. Tattooing used to be really hard to get into. My generation no longer needs the traditional shop structure to make a career. There’s a lot of DIY, underground artists who don’t have to be legitimized in a traditional sense. Not having to go through other people to get your equipment and stuff, people are able to make a living themselves, which I think is cool. There’s bad parts about that, too. Tattooing has a really rich history and beautiful lineage. When you’re disavowing shops or the old ways in general, you’re narrowing your mind. I try to think of Red Devil as a contemporary model where it’s more people who maybe didn’t have the traditional shop apprenticeship, but we are a street shop. We do walk-ins. We’re interested in the people who’ve done it before us and carrying that [spirit] on. One of my biggest influences is [pioneering Filipino American tattooer] Leo Zulueta. I got tattooed by him right before I started tattooing. He’s sort of the godfather of modern tribalism. His style is super fast, punk rock, in-your-face-looking black work, which I’d seen out in the world, but to see it in person totally flipped my lid. The shop was set up different, like the lights were lower [than most studios] and the stuff on the walls was more anthropological photos, people from antiquity or with tattoos all over their faces—tribal tattoos from different cultures. He drew the tattoo right on [my skin] and took his time drawing, erasing, and drawing it again. It was very abstract and tailored to me. I hadn’t experienced any of that before. Sometimes I’d get tattooed at a shop and people would ice me or say something about how I was a “scratcher.” I didn’t really give a fuck. Maybe this is my stubbornness or contrariness or whatever, but if somebody told me not to do something, that made me want to do it more. It gave me a drive to get better. I still have a lot to prove. I don’t know if it’s to myself or other people, but this tattooing thing—it’s endlessly challenging. The realm of possibilities is so big I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface. Your creative and technical ability is always one step behind your vision of the future. I hadn’t put much forethought into starting a shop. I was working at my house for a few years, and then I got a job at [Rogers Park’s Fudo Tattoo], which I loved. I learned a lot from the owner, Dustin Golden. But then I started to feel antsy, and I quit and opened a private tattoo studio in this old warehouse. It was just me, and I really enjoyed it. Then I was bored of that, so I met Miranda and was like, “We should open a walk-in shop.” It was always the plan she’d eventually move back to Texas, and I’d take over. Then this past January, I opened a private studio a couple blocks from the shop. That’s a lot of places to work in ten years, but I think your environment can really dictate your creativity. Changing it is a really good way to open and close chapters of your life. When I started, I was sort of a snot-nosed punk rock kid, like, “Fuck you! I do whatever I want!” Now I have so much more respect for the people who did it before me, all of my favorite tattooers from the 70s, 80s, 90s. All the stuff they were able to accomplish pre-Internet, pre-tattoo television shows, when you had to make your own needles and pigments, and be a good craftsman—it’s unbelievable what they were able to do with the limited technology available to them. My old boss, Dustin, has been building machines since the 2000s. He was the first guy I was around who did that. I’d always struggled with machines. Being self-taught, I had to figure out all that stuff on my own. I was always trying to make them work better or fix them, only to break them and have to get something new. Dustin’s machines were the first ones I even liked. He taught me how he builds them. Having the technical knowledge to troubleshoot issues really changed my tattooing. That’s a lost art now because you can literally order anything you need to tattoo off Amazon and get it in a day. But there’s a real artfulness to getting a machine to look and sound and work exactly how you want. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle because I love people. I love talking to people and working in a city like Chicago, where everyone you tattoo is so different. Touch can be a really beautiful thing in how it connects people. Plus, people will sit in the shop all day and get tattooed next to somebody, and they’re all into it. Maybe none of them would ever have a conversation on the street, but now they’re sort of initiated into this physical, tangible blood ritual that’s quite bizarre. You walk in a grocery store or whatever, and somebody comments on your tattoo—that’s a bridge, too. I still love tattooing as much as when I started. I still get giddy [like] I did when I was 14, tattooing myself in my house. There’s something about it that is so potent to me. It hasn’t lost any of its magic.

The rupee gained 2 paise to close at 88.58 against the US dollar amid strong equity markets and lower crude prices. CareEdge Ratings expects the passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes to grow by around 4% in FY26, driven by GST rationalization, easing inflation, and supportive fiscal measures in the Union Budget 2025–26. The GST cut on small cars (28% to 18%) is likely to revive entry-level demand, which has been under pressure for the last few years while removal of Cess on SUVs will further boost demand. SUVs are expected to continue dominating the market, growing by 8–10% and outpacing overall industry growth. Meanwhile, EV penetration is likely to remain modest at 3–4% while Hybrid volumes could grow by 34-38% in FY26, reaching ~1.07–1.10 lakh units, up from ~80,406 units (registered) in FY25. Madhusudhan Goswami, Assistant Director, CareEdge Ratings said, “GST rate cut coinciding with robust consumer sentiment in the festive season led to PV registrations reaching an all-time monthly high in October 2025. GST rate cut led to improved affordability, especially for the first-time PV owner. Also, robust growth in retail sales was observed across rural and urban markets. Going forward, with the end of festival season, PV sales is expected to normalize, however, growth momentum is expected to sustain due to upcoming harvest season boosting rural demand along-with seasonal demand from weddings.” The PV industry recorded healthy growth of 7.4% in FY24, which moderated to 3.7% in FY25, in line with CareEdge Ratings’ expectations. This slowdown was primarily due to the levelling off of pent-up demand, higher vehicle prices, and the high base effect of previous years. Despite these challenges, new model launches and strong SUV demand sustained overall momentum. Utility vehicle (UV) volumes grew 21.8% in FY24 and 14.0% in FY25, supported by a robust order book and rising preference for SUVs. In contrast, passenger car volumes declined 8.5% in FY24 and 11.5% in FY25, reflecting subdued entry-level demand and a structural shift toward SUVs. In a move that underscores the rising expectations for security and compliance across Web3, Polygon has officially listed Cyberscope, a subsidiary of TAC InfoSec Limited (NSE: TAC), as the first Smart Contract Audit company in the Polygon Ecosystem. The listing appears under the “Tools” category — placing Cyberscope alongside the foundational infrastructure powering thousands of decentralized applications on one of the world’s most scalable blockchain networks. For TAC InfoSec Limited, this marks another decisive step in its global Web3 expansion strategy — one that industry analysts say could materially influence the company’s audit volumes, revenue mix, and market leadership as blockchain security becomes a top-line concern for developers and investors. People familiar with the matter estimate that the Polygon integration could drive 400–500 new project engagements annually, of which 320–350 are expected to convert into full smart contract audits, supplemented by 60–80 KYC verifications. The demand pipeline is tied to the rapid growth of Polygon’s ecosystem and the increasing pressure on emerging Web3 teams to meet institutional-grade compliance norms. 360 ONE Asset has announced the appointment of Pritam Doshi as Chief Investment Officer and Head - Renewable Energy.

With India’s median age at 28.8, this generation has rising disposable income. This coupled with rapid urbanization, supportive government initiatives such as GST 2.0 and enhanced access to financial tools have enabled growth momentum in consumption.

The NextGen Consumption Fund is an actively managed fund with Nifty India New Age Consumption Index as its benchmark. The NextGen Consumption Fund uniquely invests in companies that reflect rising consumption driven by the younger generation. This fund targets the growth potential of the Indian economy by focusing on companies that cater to the changing lifestyles and demands of the next generation.

Extreme fear, record ETF outflows, and a brief slip of the futures curve into backwardation underscored the depth of the move. Yet several structural indicators are turning supportive, liquidation clusters are building in the $85K–$90K region, and short-term holder capitulation is nearing exhaustion. Together, they point toward a maturing correction phase rather than the start of a deeper bear cycle. Bitcoin’s asymmetric reaction to equity weakness also mirrors patterns historically seen around macro lows. Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s slide. Ethereum’s 20% monthly decline has driven its Mayer Multiple below 1, a zone that has repeatedly marked long-term accumulation ranges. Liquidity pockets near $2,900–$2,760 may still induce short-term volatility before a base settles. Solana and XRP recovered modestly on the week, but exchange reserves and open interest trends show broad deleveraging across majors rather than exit-driven selling. With sentiment compressed and risk premiums elevated, the market is operating inside a technical pocket that has often preceded reflexive rebounds once macro drivers stabilise. Our advice: The market is showing signs that the worst of the selling may be behind us, but it is still early to call a turn. Liquidations around $85K to $90K and cooling capitulation tell us sellers are tiring, yet we need spot strength to confirm it. Stay light, avoid leverage, and let the market show stability before adding risk. Stick with BTC and ETH for now, and treat altcoins as short, tactical trades until liquidity improves.” Hindustan Copper informed exchanges that an accident at Malanjkhand Copper Project at Balaghat District of Madhya Pradesh (a unit of Hindustan Copper Ltd) led to the demise of one contractual employee engaged by a mining contractor.

Thanks & Regards, Kunal Sodhani (Beast) (Personal view) Indian government bonds are expected to trade in a tight range early on Wednesday, with sentiment likely to remain subdued as buying from a key investor category, which includes the central bank, slumped in the previous session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note may drift between 6.50% and 6.55%, a trader at a primary dealership said, after ending at 6.5258% on Tuesday. Purchases from the “others” category, which includes the Reserve Bank of India, plummeted to about 2 billion rupees ($22.58 million), compared with a daily average of 50 billion rupees in the week ended November 7 when the central bank returned to secondary market purchases of bonds after a gap of six months, CCIL data showed. The RBI’s buying earlier this month had raised hopes that the demand–supply balance in the market would improve. The recent drop in volumes has now reinforced traders’ conviction that the purchases were largely to replace maturing holdings, rather than to send a signal for lower yields. “No buying from the others category is negative for bonds, but any further news on India’s inclusion in global indices will support the market,” a trader at a private bank said. The 10-year yield eased about 2 basis points on Tuesday, after local media reports suggested India’s chances of inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index had improved, traders said. Focus is also on the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes due after market hours on Wednesday, for cues on the U.S. rate-easing trajectory. India's equity benchmarks are set to open flat amid subdued global sentiment and investor caution ahead of key economic data.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

Full Content:
Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: Layoff notices flared in October across much of U.S., Fed report shows

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 12:16 PM EST / CBS News Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs. It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Layoff notices across the 21 states tracked by the Cleveland Fed reached a peak of more than 550,000 in March 2020. Major companies including Target, Amazon and UPS have announced rounds of job cuts in recent weeks, with some economists noting that the labor market appears to be weakening. The record-long government shutdown has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions. Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while ADP data released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1. Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come. Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a Monday email that they expect layoffs to pick up next year amid wider AI adoption, while noting that the technology has had a "net positive impact" on the labor market so far this year. The delayed September employment report, which will be released Thursday, will provide another barometer on the health of the U.S. labor market. Economists polled by financial data provider FactSet predict payroll gains of 50,000. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: UK’s Pulse Films to end TV content production as parent company Vice Studios makes redundancies

Pulse Films was behind Gangs of London for Sky and AMC Gangs of London maker Pulse Films is to stop production of TV and film content after parent company Vice Studios Group made a number of layoffs in the UK. The celebrated scripted prodco, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has made shows such as Netflix factual hit The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann and Sky action series Atomic, will now make only branded content, music videos and commercials. According to reports by Deadline, Vice has made layoffs in Pulse’s London headquarters, with all future scripted projects – such as a fourth season of Sky/AMC gangster series Gangs of London – to now be taken over by Vice Studios in LA. Vice Studios Group co-president Jamie Hall last week was named the new scripted MD for BBC Studios Productions, with the former Pulse Films chief operating officer and president of scripted TV set to take up his new role in January 2026. Vice Studios is led by former Amazon and Paramount executive Amy Powell, who was named president in May. In August, Vice raised US$75m via a new credit facility led by Western Alliance Bank, with plans to use the funds to support content investment through Vice Studios. The company said the credit facility was part of a larger five-year, US$500m investment in developing and producing scripted and unscripted content for TV, streaming and digital. Pulse was impacted in 2022 by the departures of founders and CEOs Thomas Benski and Marisa Clifford, who stepped down after 16 years at the prodco. Their departure came six years after the pair, who founded Pulse Films in 2005, sold a controlling interest to Vice Media Group. Benski subsequently joined forces with French actor Omar Sy (Lupin) and Hollywood director Louis Leterrier to launch scripted outfit Carrousel Studios in 2024, as well as rolling out talent- and IP-led media group and venture capital firm Lumina late last year. In September, Lumina made a seven-figure investment in creator-first UK management group Arcade, which represents YouTube collective The Sidemen.

Now, he is bringing his management skills to an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up with fewer than 100 employees. Project Prometheus, which Mr Bezos co-founded with scientist Vik Bajaj, will use AI to accelerate engineering and manufacturing in fields like aerospace and cars, The New York Times reported. The start-up has US$6.2 billion (S$8 billion) in funding, sourced in part from Mr Bezos himself, and employees counted in the dozens, some of whom were poached from leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. As co-CEO with Mr Bajaj, Mr Bezos is back in a formal executive post for the first time since stepping down from Amazon in 2021. The billionaire has since devoted time to his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and made headlines for his personal life, including a star-studded wedding in Venice in 2025. Mr Bezos has also more closely aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s administration, attending his inauguration in January and ordering a pro-business revamp of the opinion page at the Washington Post, the news media outlet he owns. Project Prometheus enters a crowded AI market dominated by tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, alongside pioneering firms OpenAI and Anthropic. The venture is part of a broader trend towards applying AI to physical tasks, often using robotics. Unlike the generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, it aims to develop systems that learn from real-world experimentation, rather than just digital text, with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery in physics, chemistry and engineering. Another dramatic shift since Mr Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 is the rise of AI-native start-ups built around ultra-lean teams – a reversal of the old playbook that equated headcount expansion with business growth. When Mr Bezos left the CEO seat at Amazon, he oversaw more than 1.6 million employees. On the company’s most recent earnings call, current CEO Andy Jassy attributed thousands of recent layoffs to ongoing efforts to eliminate layers of bureaucracy after years of over-hiring. Some parts of Mr Bezos’ philosophies may require a reboot for the AI era. His preference for lengthy memos with narratives indicating deep thinking by the author may be outdated now that workers can use generative AI tools to do the writing for them. But his Darwinian approach to work culture jibes with what is expected now at many of the hottest AI start-ups. And some of his management ideals, like keeping teams lean and fast and making them exceptionally talent-dense, will arguably never go out of style. When Mr Bezos stepped down after 27 years of running Amazon, he was widely lauded as one of the best CEOs in tech history. If his new start-up succeeds, it will likely come down in part to how relevant his management philosophy still is – or how much it has evolved.

Title: Dutta Dismantles the Fed's Rate-Hold Case

Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

Title: Major MMO Is Coming To Steam With A $50 Alpha Test, Which Is Actually A Discount

Ashes of Creation could be the next big MMO, if it ever releases in full. By Cameron Koch on November 17, 2025 at 9:32AM PST Indie MMORPG Ashes of Creation, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to Steam. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50. That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation website. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam. Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play. Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ. "Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states. Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from. "Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players." Ashes of Creation ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to pay $500 for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--one set in the Warhammer universe and another called project Ghost led by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street. Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of active development on its MMO New World, which once had more than 900,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO. It was, strangely, not the first time that has happened. A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of cigarettes and other tobacco-related products. This stock offers value investors a compelling entry point, along with a generous dividend yield of 7.09%. Altria manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. The company’s dividend payout is based on free cash flow, ranging from about 64% to 80% per quarter. In recent quarters, free cash flow has exceeded dividend payments, providing a solid buffer. Altria generates strong cash flow from its core tobacco business, which provides a stable base, albeit with regulatory risk, and yields are among the highest in the S&P 500, at least for now. The company primarily sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand, as well as: It sells its tobacco products primarily to wholesalers, including distributors and large retail organizations, such as chain stores. Altria used to own over 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A. (NYSE: BUD), the world’s largest brewer. Last year, the company sold 35 million of its 197 million shares through a global secondary offering. That represents 18% of its holdings but still leaves 8% of the outstanding shares in its back pocket. Altria also announced a $2.4 billion stock repurchase plan partially funded by the sale. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a $72 target price. Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) owns one of the largest portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States. It is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that pays a solid 8.15% monthly dividend and stands out in the market with its unique offering. The company has 224 hotels with more than 30,066 guest rooms across 87 markets in 37 states, plus one property leased to third parties. Its hotel portfolio includes 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels. They are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, including: Apple Hospitality hotels are in various states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, and others. Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating with a target price of $14. This top master limited partnership is one of North America’s largest and most diversified midstream energy companies. Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE: ET) is a safe option for investors seeking energy exposure and income, as the company pays a substantial 7.91% distribution. It owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. It has a strategic footprint in all the major domestic oil and gas production basins. Energy Transfer operates one of the largest integrated midstream systems in the U.S., with nearly 107,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 235 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of storage capacity. Its strong presence in Texas, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides it with access to some of the country’s most affordable natural gas. The company is receiving significant inquiries for pipeline projects to serve power plants (45 plants across 11 states) and data centers (over 40 prospective projects), with potential demand exceeding 5 Bcf/d for power plants and 3 Bcf/d for data centers. The company is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations that include: Following the acquisition of Enable Partners in December 2021, Energy Transfer owns and operates over 114,000 miles of pipelines and related assets in 41 states, spanning all major U.S. producing regions and markets. This further solidifies its leadership position in the midstream sector. Through its ownership of Energy Transfer Operating, formerly known as Energy Transfer Partners, the company also owns Lake Charles LNG Company; the general partner interests, incentive distribution rights, and 28.5 million standard units of Sunoco L.P. (NYSE: SUN); and the public partner interests and 39.7 million standard units of USA Compression Partners L.P. (NYSE: USAC). Barclays has given the stock a Buy rating with a target price of $25. Chevron acquired a 37.5% stake in Hess Midstream L.P. (NYSE: HESM) when it completed the purchase of Hess back in the summer. With a stellar 8.77% dividend on a sprawling midstream asset base, this is an incredible stock to consider now. Hess Midstream owns, operates, develops, and acquires a diverse set of midstream assets to provide services to the company and its third-party customers. The company owns oil, gas, and water handling assets located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin area in North Dakota.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.

Title: Amazon’s LORD OF THE RING MMORPG Reportedly Cancelled After Massive Layoffs

Time Published: 2025-11-16T16:37:00Z

For fans dreaming of returning to Middle-earth in a new, next-gen adventure, the news isn’t good. Amazon’s ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which had been in development since early 2023, has reportedly been cancelled. The project was meant to bring players back into Tolkien’s world with a fresh, modern spin, but development apparently stopped in October 2025. The report comes from Bloomberg, which revealed that Amazon began cutting roughly 14,000 jobs across the company in late October. Among those affected were many employees from Amazon Games, the publisher behind the long-awaited Lord of the Rings MMO. The cuts hit multiple divisions, but one key detail came from Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer, who confirmed on LinkedIn that she was among those laid off—and that the Middle-earth project was shelved. Amrine shared a bittersweet note: “Y’all would have loved it.” Amazon Games has been around since 2012, focusing primarily on publishing original titles. That focus seems to be shifting. In a memo released on October 28, 2025, the company cited “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games and outlined plans to concentrate more on its cloud gaming platform, Luna. The service primarily hosts existing titles, meaning fewer in-house game developments like the cancelled Lord of the Rings MMORPG. Despite the major shakeup, Amazon Games will continue work on March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider title, and other “casual and AI-focused games.” Still, losing such a massive and promising project sucks, not just for Amazon’s team, but for fans of Tolkien’s world who’ve been waiting for a new multiplayer experience since The Lord of the Rings Online launched back in 2007. That game, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, remains beloved but very dated by today’s standards. The cancelled MMO could have been the perfect way to bring players back to a living, breathing Middle-earth with updated visuals, gameplay, and storytelling inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings novels. The cancellation is a lost opportunity for synergy. With Amazon already heavily invested in Tolkien’s universe through The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the MMORPG could have expanded on that world, offering fans a chance to explore events from before the Third Age—when Sauron’s power still loomed large and the One Ring had yet to be destroyed in Mount Doom. Unfortunately, that vision won’t be realized anytime soon. While there are still plenty of older Lord of the Rings games to revisit, it may be a long wait before another studio takes up the challenge of creating a new MMORPG set in Middle-earth. For now, it’s a somber end to what could have been a truly epic return to one of fantasy’s most iconic worlds.

Title: AI Companies Are Treating Their Workers Like Human Garbage, Which May Be a Sign of Things to Come for the Rest of Us

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 16, 2025 9:00 AM EST In today’s economy, tech companies are red hot. In fact, the companies burning cash on AI seem to be some of the only ones having a truly great time, as the corporate rate of profit plummets throughout the US and recession fears loom. Though one economist estimates tech companies accounted for 92 percent of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025, you wouldn’t know it by looking at their staff rosters — which seem to be plummeting at an alarming rate. Amazon, for example, recently laid off 14,000 corporate employees, despite posting billions in profits across numerous lines of business. Across the month of October, tech workers made up the highest number of layoffs in any industry, leading the charge in one of the worst single months for furloughs since 2003. That’s bad news, of course, but it also directly contradicts the AI industry’s promises of — in the words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — ushering in “a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet.” Sadly, as Business Insider reports, the bloodbath is far from over. On Tuesday, the AI grading company Mercor — which has massive contracts with corporations like OpenAI and Anthropic — suddenly announced it was shuttering a huge project with Meta, leaving workers scrambling. The Meta Project, called Musen, employed some 5,000 data labelers at its peak, and was previously expected to last until at least 2026, according to BI. “They kept stressing how happy the client was and how it got extended until the end of the year,” one contractor told the publication. “So to then do this major switch up before the holidays took everyone by surprise.” Luckily for those workers, Mercor is offering to hire them back — just not for Musen. Instead, they’ll have the opportunity work on an extremely similar project named “Nova.” The main difference, it seems, is the wage offered: while Musen’s base contract was $21 an hour, Nova’s opens at $16. Two tech workers offered a Nova contract said the offer email explained the difference in pay is due to “steadier task volumes across multimedia content” and “higher hour caps, enabling greater weekly engagement.” In other words, data labelers — who already had a bum deal as stable jobs become temporary contract work — get to work more for less pay. One employee who accepted a contract to work on Nova told BI the work is functionally the same, “but for $5 less an hour.” “It sounds like most of us are in the same boat,” the worker added. “We wanted to boycott this but are not in a financial place to do so. We needed to have the guaranteed income, even if it’s demoralizing.” The whole episode underscores the false promises beneath the AI boom: jobs are being degraded, the number of “freelance workers” is soaring, AI-generated profit is almost nonexistent, and rising tides on Wall Street certainly aren’t raising all boats. If this is how the most powerful companies in the world are treating workers now, why would the AI “utopia,” as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it, be any different? What’s more, if the companies on the cutting edge of a supposed “technological revolution” can’t be expected to take care of their employees, what hope do the rest of us have?

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, "It's about culture." Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate — only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs — and the tough job market — are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well — I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised — but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off.

Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses — mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my résumé. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though — I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, "Why me?" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to

Title: Former ‘Good Morning America’ Host Joan Lunden on Distrust of the Media and AI Deepfakes: ‘A Really Sad State of Affairs’

By Antonio Ferme Joan Lunden, the veteran journalist who co-anchored “Good Morning America” from 1980 to 1997, doesn’t mince her concerns about the current media landscape. “I think it’s a really sad state of affairs that a very big segment of the American population doesn’t know what to believe anymore,” Lunden told Variety earlier this month at 50th anniversary celebration of “GMA.’ “There’s so much fake news, videos, pictures. They don’t know whether it’s really you. That part of it makes me incredibly sad and upset. I don’t know if we can put the toothpaste back in the tube.” Related Stories Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara Board Cannes-Winning Palestinian Short ‘I’m Glad You’re Dead Now’ as Executive Producers (EXCLUSIVE) While “GMA” remains a reliable ratings performer for ABC, more Americans are now getting their news from social media platforms. About half of Americans say they struggle to tell what’s true or not when they get news, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. That confusion mirrors a broader collapse in trust in both news organizations and social platforms — a decline seen across political parties and age groups. Popular on Variety “I wish somehow we could right that ship,” Lunden said. “But with AI, I think we’re going to see losses of jobs in media, just like we’re seeing them in Amazon and everywhere else.” [Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed this year’s extensive layoffs to the company’s increased rollout of ‘generative AI and agents.’] After pausing for a moment, Lunden added, “But you know what? They can’t replace a host sitting there in that chair, saying good morning to you in the morning. There’s nothing that can be said for the chemistry of two people on the air.”Outside of AI-generated deepfakes, Lunden was also quick to acknowledge how she’s benefited from the new technologies ushered in since leaving “GMA” in 1997. She recalls feeling siloed from the audience she once greeted at every sunrise.“The hardest part of leaving was disconnecting from the American audience,” she said. “Because there was no social media, it was truly a disconnect. It kind of freaked me out.” That void was eventually filled when she first logged onto social media and reconnected with her old fans. When Lunden was on air, she had “reams of people [on staff] that did nothing but answer letters,” but the direct connection on social media was on a different level. “Pretty soon I had fifty thousand, sixty thousand followers, and my husband said, ‘You cannot be talking to all those people every day.’” She chuckled, “But boy, I give it a try.” The lively “GMA” celebration at Disney’s New York headquarters united Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan with Joan Lunden and fellow veterans Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. The event followed the previous night’s airing of President Trump’s confrontational “60 Minutes” interview, his first since suing CBS over what he described as an altered version of Kamala Harris’ election-season appearance. The timing underscored the increasingly fraught relationship between politics, the press and the billionaire owners now shaping major media companies. “We obviously know that the major networks are little by little all becoming owned by the richest people in the world,” Lunden said. “We don’t want their opinions and their political viewpoints to seep into our business. But I’m a glass half full kind of girl. I really think that the journalism, as an industry, will be able to stand strong. We’ll still be here ten years from now celebrating the 60th anniversary, and you’ll still be able to ask me any question you want.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Job Prospects for 2026 College Grads to Hit 5-Year Low While Employers Eye AI, Foreign Labor
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/11/14/job-prospects-2026-college-grads-hit-five-year-low-employers-eye-ai-foreign-labor/

The outlook for the college graduating class of 2026 has dimmed sharply as data shows employer hiring plans have stalled, job market ratings have slipped, and workforce competition has intensified due to automation and visa-based labor programs. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, based on data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), employers project the job market for 2026 graduates will be the weakest in half a decade. A survey conducted among 183 companies between August 7 and September 22 found that 51 percent of respondents rated the job market for new graduates as “poor” or “fair,” a sentiment not seen at this level since the COVID-19-era downturn in 2020-21. Only two percent of employers rated the market as “excellent.” The hiring slowdown follows a wave of large-scale layoffs from major employers, including Amazon, UPS, and Verizon — the latter reportedly preparing to cut 15,000 jobs, its largest workforce reduction ever. While overall hiring for 2026 graduates is technically expected to increase by 1.6 percent, that marks a steep drop from earlier projections for the Class of 2025. Historical trends show that spring hiring often falls short of earlier fall estimates. The divergence is reflected in NACE’s year-over-year hiring projections: from a near 30 percent jump in 2022 spring plans compared to 2021, projections have since plummeted, including a contraction for the Class of 2024. According to data from job platform Handshake, full-time job postings in August dropped over 16 percent year-over-year, while applications per job rose 26 percent. Over 60 percent of 2026 graduates surveyed reported pessimism about their career outlooks. Former recruiter Giavanna Vega, who was laid off from Automation Anywhere in 2023, said companies “don’t know where to invest” amid AI uncertainty and tariffs. “They don’t have the training,” she remarked about recent graduates, many of whom are being passed over for roles that are increasingly filled by laid-off mid-career professionals. The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit 4.8 percent in June, the highest in four years and above the national average. New college graduates are now not only competing with each other, but also with recently laid-off workers and foreign graduates entering the U.S. workforce through visa programs. Rising scrutiny of visa programs such as H-1B and OPT (Optional Practical Training) has enabled hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates to work in U.S. jobs originally intended for American college students. The Department of Justice (DOJ) under Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon has pledged increased enforcement of longstanding visa-related laws to curb what officials describe as the systemic replacement of domestic talent. Eric Sell, a senior lawyer at the DOJ Civil Rights Division, emphasized that the administration is determined to hold companies accountable for how they treat American workers, especially during periods of economic upheaval and rapid technological change. He stressed that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, technological advancement would “never be used as an excuse to forget the workers that built this country,” and he warned that those attempting to exploit chaotic growth for corporate gain “will be held accountable.” Public frustration has been intensifying. A new Cygnal poll finds that 44 percent of likely voters say companies exploit the H-1B system. Among swing voters, 43 percent agree with that assessment. Notably, the backlash against these visa programs is strongest among working-class Americans and voters without a college degree, key electoral constituencies ahead of the 2026 midterms. In 2024 alone, the Biden administration approved work permits for approximately 400,000 foreign college graduates through the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program — a 45 percent increase from 2020 levels under President Trump. Former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and other Trump administration officials have warned that programs like OPT are depressing wages and displacing American graduates, particularly in high-demand STEM and business fields. The pipeline from foreign student to U.S. worker also begins at the admissions level. Breitbart News opinion contributor Rich Kaye questioned why taxpayer-funded public universities are increasingly filling seats with international students who later convert F-1 student visas into work permits. “When a public university replaces a Georgia student with an F‑1 student in a high‑demand field,” Kaye wrote, “it increases the pipeline pressure tomorrow for H‑1B allocations in exactly the sectors where Americans could be trained to fill roles.” That pressure is already being felt by recent graduates like Nalin Haley, who told UnHerd that many in his peer group are struggling just to get started. “It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one,” he stated. “I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.
