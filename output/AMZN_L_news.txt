A total of 358,737 applications were received this year—down from over 480,000 last year—making it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration’s “America First” and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump’s previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. “As companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,” said Sharma. “Employers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.” Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. “The L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,” she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. “If the economic climate improves and there’s a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,” she said.

Title: Blog: Whatever Happened To 'Working From Home'? Why Your Boss Wants You Back In Office
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/blog/whatever-happened-to-working-from-home-8463061
Time Published: 2025-05-20T13:30:18Z

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about “fauxductivity” - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of £7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers. (Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media) Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves. A Qatari official told CNN the plane would be a 'gift to the Pentagon', a 'government-to-government transaction' that will then be 'donated' to Trump's presidential library. On February 20, 2025, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed to be a KGB officer, made the most fantastic of Facebook posts - that in 1987 Russia recruited a then 40-year-old Donald Trump as an 'intelligence asset'. On board the rocket was EOS-9, designed to provide continuous and reliable remote sensing data for operational applications across various sectors. For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals. Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza has entered its most intense phase yet with the expansion of Operation Gideon's Chariot. If Tim Cook complies with Trump's plan, the US President's "little problem" might translate into a big problem The man was walking away from me, about 100-150 metres away. I shouted out his name. He stopped, but didn't turn. The muzzles of at least half a dozen AK-47s were pointed at me. Virat Kohli was forged by his flaws, which continues as he calls it quits in Test cricket When we forget about the wounds of war, we don't think twice before waging one. The poems of Kishwar Naheed, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, and many more offer a jolt to such public amnesia.

Microsoft has laid off around 6,000 employees, or nearly 3% of its global workforce, marking its largest round of job cuts in over two years. The layoffs come as the company continues to invest heavily—$80 billion this fiscal year—in AI infrastructure and data centers. Despite strong quarterly earnings, the cuts signal a shift in strategic focus.

Title: The Business Roundtable is MIA Against Trump’s Attacks
URL: https://time.com/7286691/business-roundtable-mia-trumps-attacks/
Time Published: 2025-05-19T19:42:20Z
Full Content:
U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

ByExpert Panel® ByExpert Panel®, Forbes Councils Member. To a layperson, technology and biological life may seem like opposite poles. However, the tech industry regularly draws lessons from living organisms, striving to build tools and systems that not only learn, adapt and evolve—like artificial intelligence—but can also make decisions and take action in real time, as humans do. From neural networks to swarm robotics, many of today’s most sophisticated technologies are inspired by the natural functions and collective behavior of living organisms. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council share compelling real-world examples of “living intelligence” technologies, as well as natural creatures and phenomena that are inspiring adaptive tech systems and tools. Read on to learn what the convergence of nature and technology signals for the future of humanity. As a cancer scientist, I use digital AI technology to analyze cancer tissue slides. I am impressed that this innovative technology can predict immune cell types with spatial context. It can derive thousands of features that human eyes can’t see. I can see a gold mine in front of us—some of these features can be groundbreaking in detecting cancer and predicting the outcomes of therapies. - Rachel Tam, Bristol Myers Squibb Starlings exemplify one of nature’s most mesmerizing displays of swarm intelligence in action. Their behavior demonstrates how simple sets of localized rules can give rise to complex collective phenomena.

Additionally, it responds instantly to any accident or special incident. - David Barberá Costarrosa, Beeping Fulfilment The distributed decision-making of honeybees is a strong example of biological intelligence. Through decentralized communication, bees make complex collective decisions, such as choosing their new hive. AI and robotics algorithms draw inspiration from nature’s teamwork, demonstrated by swarm intelligence, which provides efficient solutions to real-world problems. - Roshan Mahant, LaunchIT Corp. Ants build cities, farm aphids and coordinate like tiny logistics pros—all without a boss. That decentralized brilliance inspired algorithms behind things like traffic flow and delivery routing. Turns out, a little chaos with clear rules scales beautifully. Nature’s “dumb” systems often outsmart centralized control—sometimes the smartest move is letting go (strategically). - Joel Frenette, TravelFun.Biz Mycorrhizal networks—the “wood-wide web”—fascinate me. Through fungal connections, trees share resources and warnings, showing a form of collective intelligence. This challenges brain-centered definitions of intelligence and reveals the deep interdependence in ecosystems—an insight vital for sustainability. - Mohit Menghnani, Twilio Tesla’s self-driving cars are a powerful example of living intelligence, learning and evolving with real-time data.

Title: AvalonBay braces for signs of trouble in DC rental market

Let Multifamily Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. CEO Ben Schall also said the softness in the REIT’s expansion markets could provide opportunities to add assets. On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. “Recognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,” Schall said on the REIT’s earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird’s-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. “Over the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,” Breslin said. “About 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.” AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here’s more on what’s happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn’t been seen in 20 years. “Our established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,” Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT’s properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. “Northern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,” Breslin said. “Performance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.” As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro’s availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB’s year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. “We'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,” Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB’s coastal markets. “While we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,” Schall said. “On the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.” In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. “These are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,” Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay’s chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. “And that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.” Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay “You think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,” Breslin said. “You look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.” AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. “As these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,” Schall said.

Title: Silicon Valley's era of open debate fades as companies clamp down on employee dissent

Through the looking glass: As the tech industry continues to tighten control over employee speech and activism, a culture once defined by open dialogue and political engagement gives way to one marked by silence and fear of reprisal. "It's different now; employers feel they can get away with stuff," said a former Google employee. In recent years, Silicon Valley has witnessed a sharp shift in how major technology companies respond to employee activism and internal dissent. Once known for a culture encouraging open debate and political engagement, the tech industry is now cracking down on workers who challenge company policies or voice concerns about controversial business practices. Last month, two employees who interrupted an event with founder Bill Gates and CEO Satya Nadella to protest Microsoft's involvement in the Israel-Gaza war were quickly fired. Five years ago, by contrast, Microsoft divested from an Israeli facial recognition startup suspected of surveilling Palestinian citizens, partly in response to internal pressure. Also read: Microsoft fires engineers over AI protest at 50th-anniversary event This incident is part of a larger trend in the industry. Across the tech sector, companies are increasingly rejecting worker petitions, terminating employees who organize protests, and deleting critical posts from internal forums. Internet platforms have also warned against leaking information to the media, and some workers have lost their jobs as a result. Other policies have been implemented to prevent employees from contacting regulators. Last year, some OpenAI employees filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that the company's restrictive agreements prevented staff from warning regulators about AI safety risks. At the same time, the tech labor market has undergone dramatic changes, as mass layoffs, once rare among tech giants, have become increasingly routine. Since 2023, more than half a million tech jobs have been cut, according to Layoffs.fyi. This month, Microsoft announced a 3 percent reduction in its global workforce, following similar moves by Meta and Intel. The crackdown on dissent has intensified during the presidency of Donald Trump. Executives at Google, Meta, and Amazon contributed millions to Trump's inauguration committee and have engaged with the White House in private meetings. Many companies have also introduced policies that align with the administration's agenda, such as eliminating diversity initiatives and reversing longstanding content moderation practices. These changes might once have sparked significant activism among Silicon Valley's traditionally liberal workforce. However, aggressive management tactics and a weak job market have dampened employees' willingness to speak out. "A decade ago, employees would discuss controversial political issues out in the open and on employee message boards and at all-hands meetings," said Nu Wexler, a communications consultant with experience at Google, Twitter, and Meta. Now, "the companies have either strongly discouraged that or banned it." These tactics are having their intended effect. After Google announced in February that it would no longer avoid using AI for weapons or surveillance, internal message boards remained largely silent, a stark contrast to seven years ago when thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to cancel a Pentagon contract for AI-powered drone analysis. Employees, though, have not gone completely silent. A group called No Azure for Apartheid was launched and is led by current and former Microsoft employees who are protesting the company's business dealings with the Israeli military and government. It is holding a protest this weekend. However, Microsoft has come down hard on employees participating in such protests during company time. Microsoft fired at least five employees who protested during a town hall with CEO Satya Nadella. The workers, wearing T-shirts that read "Does Our Code Kill Kids, Satya?" were part of No Azure for Apartheid. Google, too, fired more than 50 employees last year after protests against its cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government. CEO Sundar Pichai had previously warned employees not to use the company as a "personal platform" or to "fight over disruptive issues or debate politics."

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Raise The Price Of Everything
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2025/05/16/what-to-buy-before-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-05-16T18:32:18Z

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, we have seen prices rise and the stock market fall. Then we saw tariff delays leading to stock market surges, even as a massive tariff was placed on Chinese imports. This was followed by framework trade deal agreements with assorted nations, dramatically lowered tariffs on China due to the beginning of bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and China, and a shipping container’s worth of general uncertainty and unease. Despite this, what is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise if they have not already, even if not so much as initially feared. That’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance experts to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Tariffs generally fall into two categories: Baseline and reciprocal. Each has a different strategic purpose for the levier, and impact on those levied. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government, though tentative deals with select nations (such as the United Kingdom) may soon bring those down for some global partners. Few elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. As for what goods are affected, Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business, says: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Shortly after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” To understand the impact of tariffs on consumer goods, it’s important to first define the broader context of trade in the United States. “The U.S. trades a lot and imports a lot,” says Sarada, Ph.D. and adjunct assistant professor of strategy at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. "Imports include raw building materials, electronics such as computers and phones, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, machinery and equipment, cars and car parts, clothing, footwear, fruit, tree nuts, coffee and so much more." Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, adds that because of this reliance on imports, plus the ways the tariffs have been imposed, he expects that "nearly everything will increase in price.” He goes on: “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. As the tariff landscape continues to fluctuate, so too will the retailers affected by this change, as will the timing of the impact on the larger consumer marketplace. For example, China was briefly levied with a formidable 145% tariff rate, which saw countless shipping containers full of thousands of dollars worth of goods simply stop their forward progress toward the American consumer. Lower-value shipments, such as those from Shein and Temu, also seemed poised to slow dramatically. That’s because the large volume of direct-to-consumer shipments from companies like these, worth less than $800, have, until now, been exempt from tariff fees. This was because of a rule known as the “de minimis exemption.” According to an official White House press release: “On average, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.” As of May 2, 2025, that exemption is no more, and even these smaller shipments were expected to be assessed with import fees. Along with that initial 145% tariff, it looked like shipments could cost the consumer more than double the expense expected at the time of the order. Now, with American tariffs on Chinese imports lowered to 30% for at least most of the summer, prices may stay more manageable than expected, these low-cost retailers are likely to retain a decent share of the American market. All that said, reduced tariffs on China and framework trade deals with trading partners around the globe are likely not enough to head off price increases in the short term and the lingering chance of recession. As an example, Walmart, still the world’s largest retailer, is planning to raise prices soon. While many products Walmart sells are produced domestically in the United States—including much of the food and grocery items the retail giant offers—its assortment of toys, electronics and other major sellers for the company are overwhelmingly made in China. Even the temporary 30% increase on tariffs will impact the prices Americans pay. While we saw some price increases in anticipation of the tariffs and some shortly after they hit, the majority of the price jumps will take place months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the early summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. Given how interconnected the American economy is to the global world beyond, the impact of tariffs will undoubtedly be felt across industries and continents, from financial markets to factories and beyond. From a purely domestic perspective, Sarada explains it like this: “Tariffs, the production of goods and services, prices, portfolio values, employment and salaries are all intertwined. Once there is volatility or uncertainty [due to] tariffs, then we can expect uncertainties across these different aspects of the economy. When there is uncertainty, a small fraction of economic agents, like some types of traders and fund managers, wealthy individuals and some entrepreneurs can seize the opportunity to shift resources quickly into markets that are dropping and then cash out when they rise.” Further, some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Sarada adds: “Most people respond to uncertainty in the economy by pulling back." And as for how soon this might occur, exactly “when people will start pulling back depends on what they experience—whether they start losing jobs, see portfolios fall in value for a sustained period or stop receiving wage increases or bonuses.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.
