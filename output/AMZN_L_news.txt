The once-hypothetical cuts are coming, whether employees are ready or not. On Tuesday, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, confirmed the fears of many workers in the age of artificial intelligence: He said he expects the technology will lead to job cuts at the tech giant. In his memo, which was posted online, Jassy did not announce immediate layoffs. He said that, in the next few years, "efficiency gains" from AI would translate to a smaller corporate workforce. Marlo Lyons, a certified executive coach, told Business Insider that jobs will inevitably change — including outright disappearances. "So is your job at risk? Absolutely. If you don't get on board with AI, yes, absolutely, you're going to lose your job." Amazon is now one of the largest companies to explicitly state that AI will impact its employees' jobs. BI previously reported that roles that include tasks that AI can perform are disappearing from job boards faster than positions that have fewer tasks that AI can accomplish. Shopify's CEO said in April that, before hiring anyone new, employees must prove AI can't do the job better. Duolingo plans to phase out contractors and replace them with AI. And Salesforce's CEO, Marc Benioff, has said that the company might not hire engineers in 2025 because those already on the payroll are getting so much more done thanks to AI tools. The industry you're in matters. Office workers appear to be particularly at risk. In late May, Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, suggested AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said earlier this month that he expects the impact of AI on white-collar jobs to be so significant that it will lead to a recession. Christian Schneider, the CEO of New York-based startup fileAI, told BI that he's already seeing job losses in corners of the tech industry, and he expects AI to exacerbate the trend. "I'm totally expecting a tightening," he said. "I think when we look into tech layoffs, it's so apparent that something is changing." Melissa Swift, the founder and CEO of work consultancy Anthrome Insight, told BI that productivity hasn't always increased to the same degree as tech advances. It often "ticks up slowly, like a kiddie roller coaster going up the first big hill." Those who aren't keeping up risk being left behind. And refusing to acknowledge the risk doesn't make it go away, Lyons said. "So if you're redesigning the workplace, and how things are getting done — whether it's a workflow or structures of teams, or the same thing with AI — you can hold on with white knuckles, but it's still going to happen around you," Lyons said. Of course, not all the jobs affected by advancements in AI will mean the workers filling them will be laid off. Jassy acknowledged in his statement that Amazon will "need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs." Schneider said some jobs will change so that typical back-office, rote tasks will fall to AI and allow more workers to take on people-facing roles. Or, officegoers once responsible for pulling and preparing data might now move to the end of the process to, for example, check the quality of the results AI produces. While some jobs will disappear and others will evolve, Schneider said, workers are often good at adapting. "Honestly, I wouldn't want to underestimate people's drive," he said. Jump to

Title: Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy's memo about AI killing corporate jobs

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees on Tuesday that AI would shrink the company's corporate white-collar workforce over the next few years, citing "efficiency gains" as the driving force. Amazon employees weren't having it. Across internal Slack channels, Amazon's white-collar workers tore into Jassy's message, taking aim at his leadership and unapologetic push for AI, according to messages seen by Business Insider. BI viewed dozens of messages found across three different internal channels, which include thousands of employees in total. The criticism was widespread across the channels. Some called for a shift in the company's mindset and warned of the risks of relying too much on AI. Others voiced blunt concerns about looming layoffs, while a few demanded that leadership share in the fallout. "There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years," one person wrote in Slack. Some Amazon employees seemed to agree with Jassy's move. One person wrote that middle management in general could be replaced by Amazon's AI app and "no one would notice," alluding to the company's decision to reduce management layers this year. "At least he said the quiet part out loud," another employee wrote. "We all knew it but now it's clearly part of the plan." An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. One key debate centered on how AI should be positioned within a corporate environment. Many of the internal Slack messages noted that a 50% productivity boost from AI gives companies two options: Reduce the workforce and maintain current output, or keep the team intact and grow the business. Amazon, in this case, is choosing to do the same with less, they argued. "We need to lead the change in reframing AI as partners (even teammates or colleagues) rather than AI as replacements or tools," one person wrote. "It's a slightly different vision than the one Andy alludes to." Another person wrote that Jassy was defining success as "a smaller corporate workforce," not in terms of customer satisfaction. BI previously reported that Amazon was freezing its hiring budget for its retail business this year. "He, as the CEO, has shown he can deliver on one of those things and not the other," this person wrote. Others voiced concerns about leaning too heavily on AI without proper safeguards. While some found summary tools useful, employees warned that AI isn't always a reliable source of truth. It can lead to poor decisions and a future in which people turn to AI to solve problems it caused in the first place, they said. "It's dangerous, and it will have real consequences," one of the employees wrote. Some employees questioned whether Tuesday's memo signaled more layoffs ahead. One said any message from Jassy filled them with instant "deep dread," while another said they saw it as yet another example of his relentless focus on cost cutting over the years. "This seems to be the [antithesis] of Think Big, and is part of a continual trend that our CEO doesn't seem to have a vision for the company other than 'do what we do today cheaper, and also AI will happen,'" one of the people wrote. Some employees took a cynical view of the role of senior executives, questioning why AI-driven cuts seem to target rank-and-file workers while top leadership remains untouched. Amazon's senior S-team, for example, has only expanded under Jassy's watch. "Will it result in less SVPs?" one of the people wrote. Have a tip?

Title: Andy Jassy is the perfect Amazon CEO for the looming Gen AI (cost-cutting) era
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/06/17/andy-jassy-perfect-amazon-ceo-generative-ai-cost-cutting-memo/

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told hundreds of thousands of his employees on Tuesday that generative AI is coming for their jobs and that their best bet is to embrace the technology. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. But no matter how geeked Amazon employees get over new AI tools, Jassy also made a point to note that there’s not room on the bus for everybody: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” As I read this note—and I recommend reading the whole thing—some questions quickly came to mind. Are some parts of Amazon’s vast organization highly resistant to the new technology and perhaps in need of a public nudge (or kick in the butt), in Jassy’s view? Seems likely. Is the public memo a wink-wink to Wall Street that the company’s heavy AI investments will eventually pay off by delivering significant cost reductions? I suppose. Is the note meant to provide some glossy AI cover for imminent or future mass layoffs that may have nothing, or just something, to do with AI actually eating some corporate tasks? I guess that’s possible too, though I find it less likely. And are the parts of the essay where Jassy methodically outlines the various ways Amazon already uses gen AI—a ritutal he has performed publicly on more than one occasion this year—designed to thrust Amazon into AI-dominated news cycles that often feature many other companies not named Amazon? Perhaps. No matter the exact goal or impetus, and Amazon isn’t saying what exactly the impetus for this public memo was, Jassy seems like the right leader for the current job—especially on the cost-cutting, or, as he referred to it in his annual shareholder letter in April, the “cost avoidance and productivity” bucket of gen-AI impact. I don’t mean to discount Jassy’s ability to lead on the innovation front. He transformed and led Amazon Web Services, after all, from its infancy into the behemoth cloud provider it is today. But ever since taking over as CEO from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy has also become the company’s chief cost-cutter and has appeared comfortable in the role. He has overseen the largest corporate layoffs in company history in recent years, joining other Big Tech companies like Meta, Alphabet, and Salesforce, which all slashed headcounts after overhiring in the pandemic. His logistic teams have rejiggered the U.S. warehouse network and inventory systems to reduce the cost of getting each product to a customer. And he’s also pushed teams to accelerate the automation of some warehouse tasks, which over time could allow the company to do more with less—or at least more with the same. Some of these moves were necessitated by Bezos handing over to Jassy a bloated and sometimes wasteful company when the CEO transition happened nearly four years ago. But it also appears to this close observer of the company that Jassy is quite comfortable in the role; though whether he enjoys it or simply accepts it I don’t know. So, whether Amazon’s AI jobs shakeout turns out to be a painful retrenching, a gradual recalibration, or something else entirely, recent history seems to suggest the company, if nothing else, has the right man for the job.

Title: Amazon Preps Employees for Layoffs by Talking Up the Power of AI Agents

Amazon appears to be soft-launching its next round of layoffs. In a message to employees shared Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy talked highly of the company’s embrace of artificial intelligence tools across its company, and said that it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. That is only slightly veiled corporate speak for “get ready to be replaced.” Jassy called generative AI a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that will change the way the company operates, and said Amazon is already using it in “virtually every corner of the company.” According to Jassy, Amazon already has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, and said, “thatâs a small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” So it’s clear the company is all in on AI. Amazon previously said it would commit $100 billion to investing in AI technologies this year. As for humans? Well, it seems Amazon is not so committed to them long-term. Jassy told the company’s 1.5 million employees that generative AI will “change the way our work is done,” and said that the company will ultimately “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” The underlying message: you might soon be out of work. “Itâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy wrote. The CEO did offer his workers, some of whom are likely wondering just how long they’ll be employed, how to potentially survive the next round of layoffs (or, maybe more likely, help train their future replacements). “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your teamâs brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.” Amazon has been in the process of stripping its workforce down to the bones in departments it seems to care less about. The company cut about 100 people from its devices and services team earlier this year, and around the same number from its books department. Per CNBC, it has laid off about 27,000 people since 2022 and has its eyes on further cuts. It’s hard to look at Jassy’s AI-forward message as much else other than an indicator that more layoffs are just around the corner. It’s possible the AI hype is just a cynical attempt to position itself as being an industry leader when the real goal is cutting salaries to boost stock price. It wouldn’t be the first company to try to go all-in on AI at the expense of human labor. Earlier this year, Klarna announced it was bringing back human customer service representatives after trying to leave the task to AI after finding the outcomes aren’t great and people don’t really like dealing with AI agents.

Title: Amazon CEO Says AI Will Lead to Layoffs and ‘Change the Way Our Work Is Done,’ Tells Employees: ‘Be Curious About AI, Educate Yourself’

Andy Jassy tells employees to 'be curious about AI, educate yourself' By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon chief executive officer Andy Jassy outlined a near future where AI will “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” — but at the same time, he said, the technology will cut the overall number of jobs at the ecommerce giant. In a memo Tuesday to Amazon employees, Jassy shared “Some thoughts on Generative AI.” “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Related Stories David Hekili Kenui Bell, 'Lilo & Stitch' Live Action Actor, Dies at 46 According to an Amazon spokesperson, Jassy’s reference to a reduction in workforce does not necessarily mean layoffs; for example, the company could offer voluntary early retirement packages. Popular on Variety As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. Jassy encouraged Amazon employees to “be curious about AI” and “educate yourself.” “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy wrote. Nine months ago, Jassy informed Amazon’s corporate staffers they were expected to report to the office five days per week, so the company will be “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” Today, Amazon is investing “quite expansively” in generative AI, according to Jassy’s June 17 memo. The company has more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built to date, “but at our scale, that’s a small fraction of what we will ultimately build,” the CEO said. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI. I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners, and how we work,” Jassy wrote. Jassy took over the role of Amazon’s CEO in July 2021 from founder Jeff Bezos, who is now executive chairman. After joining the company in 1997, Jassy started the Amazon Web Services group and led it for nearly 20 years. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: The biggest fear was that AI would steal our jobs. In reality, it’s replacing those of people who are learning how to work.

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/17/2025 1:00:18 PM PDT by Cronos As thousands of young graduates prepare to take their first steps on the job market, an unexpected obstacle stands in their way: artificial intelligence. The technological promise that was supposed to relieve us of repetitive tasks seems, paradoxically, to be blocking the access of new generations to the professional world. The broken path to employment Traditionally, young people start their careers with internships, junior positions or simple assignments that allow them to learn and work their way up. But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Here’s a good sentence for every Gen-Z worker (and others) to remember to NOT ask in their work duties and job hunting. “How do I get training from the company” Here is what they need to remember. The resources for training is going for AI Models through Machine Learning & not for training human resources. Human resources get their training through self-service. What they should instead be saying is: “What are the resources and recommendations on what I can do to proactively do continuous learning and self-service for gaining new skills that the company needs?” Anyone not a proactive self-starter on working & learning (and most importantly on getting feedback from their management to ensure they are aligned with the fast changing needs of their business unit) is moving themselves to the front of the line for layoffs or exclusion on getting new jobs. Companies just won’t have much use for humans that act like machines that have to be instructed on everything. 4 posted on 06/17/2025 1:08:30 PM PDT by Degaston [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: algore AI with robotics already flip burgers.

Used to be that kids and teens learned the value of paid work by mowing lawns, delivering newspapers, and working in fast food stores. Now all those jobs are held by adult migrants. Early every morning, I see pickup trucks delivering the Los Angeles Times (often one adult at the wheel, and one in the back tossing the papers). Migrants do landscaping. And adult migrants now make a lifetime "career" by working at a fast food joint. 14 posted on 06/17/2025 1:22:45 PM PDT by Angelino97 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Besides AI, there are many things which will contribute to a financial, as well as intellectual and cultural divide in this country. As a small example - my son just graduated college and started his first job. He faces a wide choice of many different programs offered by the employer - from 401K, IRAs, to 5 levels of Obama health-care, to HSA, to FSA, to disability insurance to extended disability insurance, all of which have differing costs with different levels of risk/reward. Then there is the complexity of the tax code as well, IRAs He can figure it out easily enough himself, and then track, manage, and optimize these programs over the next several decades of his career/life. But what about those 50% of Americans with below 99 IQ? It seems the complexity of life, money, finance, debt and law will almost necessarily lead them to be working drones - or government dependents. 15 posted on 06/17/2025 1:23:44 PM PDT by PGR88 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Cronos Well, if it is taking their jobs now, it will be takin the jobs from those who currently have jobs when they are no longer needed.

But as Aneesh Raman, Head of Business Opportunities at LinkedIn, explains, “the first rung of the career ladder is disappearing”. The reason for this? It is precisely these introductory tasks – administrative, repetitive, often unskilled – that companies are now entrusting to generative AI. Tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are already automating tasks previously carried out by young employees: writing bits of code, data entry, administrative assistance… The result? A drop in “on-the-job” learning opportunities. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate for young graduates in the United States is 5.8%, compared with 6.2% for younger workers. This rise is partly linked to the rapid automation of entry-level tasks. Companies such as Duolingo and Shopify are already actively reducing the recruitment of juniors for these roles, preferring to entrust them to AI systems. A bleak future for young people? Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent.

Chris Hyams, CEO of Indeed, points out that “in around two-thirds of professions, more than half of the skills required can be performed satisfactorily, or even excellently, by current AI”. While AI does not completely replace jobs, it does make many stages of the traditional training pathway obsolete. The paradox is striking: companies are warning of a shortage of skilled labour… but no longer offer the conditions to train this talent. In Europe, this tension is all the more marked because companies are struggling to recruit experienced technical profiles, while young people can no longer access the positions that would allow them to become such. If the trend continues, AI will not eliminate millions of jobs in one fell swoop: it will simply prevent future professionals from emerging. And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

And in the long term, there is a great risk that we will end up with powerful tools, but without enough qualified human resources to supervise and develop them. But for this to be of benefit to everyone, we need to rethink professional integration and guarantee a space for human learning where machines are gaining ground.

Title: Amazon CEO Tells Staffers to Expect AI-Related Layoffs: ‘It Should Change the Way Our Work Is Done’
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/amazon-ceo-warns-staff-ai-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T19:26:53Z

“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Andy Jassy says in a Tuesday memo Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed staffers that they should anticipate potential layoffs across the company as they expedite the implementation of artificial intelligence in an effort to boost and/or improve the customer experience. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in a message to employees on Tuesday. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The potential layoffs could impact many across Amazon’s workforce, which consists of about 1,556,000 full-time and part-time staffers globally. Jassy mentioned that Amazon now has over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress, adding that the amount is just a small fraction of what the company would ideally like to build. While noting that Amazon has already shifted into an AI-leaning model, highlighting its rollout of Alexa+ and the use of its AI shopping assistant, Jassy further encouraged workers to become “curious about AI.” “Educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams,” Jassy, who started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, wrote. For now, he shared that Amazon has only scratched the surface in its heavy pivot to AI-powered tools and resources, but added that he believes the technology will “change how we all work and live.” “Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time,” his message continued. “There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they’re coming, and coming fast.” Lastly, the executive shared that he’s excited about the future of AI at the company and that he hopes his staff will take part in its journey. “There’s so much more to come with Generative AI,” Jassy concluded. “I’m energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what’s possible for our customers, partners and how we work.”

Title: Amazon’s Jassy says AI will reduce company’s corporate ranks

Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy says he expects the company’s workforce to decline in the next few years as the retail and cloud-computing giant uses artificial intelligence to handle more tasks. Generative AI and AI-powered software agents “should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in an email to employees on Tuesday that laid out his thinking about how the emerging technology will transform the workplace. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” From the start of the AI boom, people inside and outside the industry have raised concerns about the potential for artificial intelligence to replace workers. Those concerns have only grown as tech companies introduce more sophisticated AI systems that can write code and field online tasks on a user’s behalf. Shopify Inc. told employees that requests for new headcount will require an explanation as to why AI can’t do the job. Duolingo Inc. said it would “gradually stop” using contractors to do work that artificial intelligence can handle. And Microsoft Corp. recently announced a round of layoffs that hit software developers hardest. Dario Amodei, CEO of OpenAI rival Anthropic, recently warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and cause unemployment to spike to as high as 20% over the next five years. Amazon, which has prioritized automation in logistics and headquarters roles for years, is investing heavily in AI. Jassy, in his letter, rattled off some of those initiatives, including the Alexa+ voice software, a shopping assistant, and tools for developers and businesses sold by the Amazon Web Services cloud unit. Inside the company, Amazon has used AI tools for inventory placement, customer service and product listings. Jassy encouraged employees to “experiment with AI whenever you can.” “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he said. Amazon is the largest private U.S. employer after Walmart Inc., with 1.56 million employees as of the end of March. Most work in warehouses packing and shipping items, but about 350,000 of them have corporate jobs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy admits AI will ‘reduce’ corporate workforce

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy ominously warned Tuesday that he expects the rise of generative artificial intelligence to “reduce” the company’s corporate workforce in the next few years. The Amazon boss, who replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO in 2021, said generative AI is a “once in a lifetime” technology that “should change the way our work is done” as the company integrates it into its business operations. As a result, Amazon will “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in lengthy memo to employees that was also posted on the company’s website. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy added. Amazon had a corporate workforce of approximately 350,000 employees as December. Overall, the company had more than 1.5 million full-time and part-time employees at the end of last year, including at its warehouse and fulfillment centers. Jassy said Amazon already has more than 1,000 generative AI services or applications in the works, which will “small fraction of what we will ultimately build.” Amazon’s inventory management, customer service chatbot and product pages are likely to get an upgrade as a result of AI. Employees should “be curious about AI” and participate in efforts to learn “how to get more done with scrappier teams,” he added. The remarks come as more AI leaders call out the likelihood that advancements in AI will shake up the labor market. Last month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei raised alarms when he warned that executives and politicians should stop “sugar-coating” the mass layoffs that could occur in fields like tech, finance and law and be honest with workers. Amodei said he expects significant job losses in the next one to five years, with US unemployment potentially spiking to 20%, up from its current level of 4.2%. In a dire scenario, AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs, he suggested. Amazon isn’t the only company likely to experience a major workforce shakeup as a result of generative AI. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently said he expects AI to take on a bigger role within Meta’s workforce. “Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” Zuckerberg said during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Elsewhere, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned in April 2023 that he expected “knowledge workers,” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers, to be at risk. Advertisement

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Tired of hiring first-year analysts who already have private-equity job offers, some banks are ... More looking to redefine the traditional recruiting timeline. Young bankers looking to break into private equity could be looking at a new recruiting timeline. In recent years, many of the top firms in the country have recruited aspiring bankers and investment managers for post-grad jobs two years in advance. Fighting for coveted internships, many recruits begin their first full-time job with a signed offer for their second already secured, but with a delayed start date of two years. It’s a typical practice for competitive positions in other industries, too. Law students seeking to work in Big Law, for example, often seek out their second year summer associate job during the spring and summer after their first year, with the hopes of getting an offer for a full-time position at the same firm after. But JPMorgan is over it. The bank told incoming graduates that they would be fired if they accept future job offers at other companies before starting at the bank or within their first 18 months of employment, according to Bloomberg. Private equity firms are already responding. Apollo Global Management told prospective investment banking applicants that it won’t extend offers to the class of 2027 this year. Still, while recruiting potential hires so early might seem counterproductive, it’s what many big banks have resorted to in order to beat out competition for the best talent.

Full return-to-office mandates were all the rage at the start of the year, with firms like Amazon and Dell calling their employees back on-site. Six months after implementation, some workers are filing disability claims and employee morale is falling. It’s been six months since thousands of U.S. workers were brought back into the office full-time, and many returning employees are now unhappy, unmotivated and even complaining about the lack of disability accommodations. Workers across generations are unsatisfied with RTO, according to the Adaption Institute, and more days in the office is not improving burnout or intent-to-quit rates. At JPMorgan, an internal culture study found that fewer employees feel like their health and well-being are a corporate priority, likely triggered by the bank’s strict five-day in-office policy. Then there are those who say that their requests for exemption from RTO mandates due to disabilities are not being heard. Employees at Amazon have filed disability complaints both with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, two federal agencies tasked with regulating working conditions. In one complaint, workers allege the company is deleting posts in internal chat rooms that share dissatisfaction with the RTO process, according to Bloomberg. But not all companies are forcing their employees to come back to the office. Bankers at Citibank, for example, are seeing the opposite response, as the bank’s hybrid employees will be able to work remotely for two weeks of their choice in August, according to its new policy. Working Euro-summer, anyone? News from the world of work. Many companies don’t instinctively know how to hire and support disabled employees. Forbes’ Accessibility 100 ranked the best companies building accessibility tools across teams and industries. From crafting better job descriptions to creating workplaces where different ways of thinking can thrive, these companies are opening doors to jobs that were once inaccessible. President Donald Trump’s new travel ban is already having widespread impacts. For one, foreign doctors slated to start their residencies in July from the 19 countries banned may not be able to enter the U.S. at all, exacerbating the country’s doctor shortage. Despite the persistent calls for increased deportations from the president, the Trump Organization continues to bring in foreign workers to staff its clubs and winery, Forbes’ Zach Everson reports. The company has filed to bring in at least 1,880 seasonal workers since 2008, and this year has posted intentions to hire 31 foreign workers on temporary visas to work for its winery through October. New York state updated its WARN notice requirements—which identify mass layoffs for companies with more than 50 employees—to include robotics or AI-related cuts. It marks the first time employers will have to explicitly disclose if automation is replacing workers, which could lead to more worker protections down the line. The line between showbiz and content creators is blurring.

Adam Stotsky, a longtime NBCUniversal executive, has taken the helm at Vice Media and plans to lead a turnaround focused on the embattled media conglomerate’s studio and advertising divisions, according to a report on Monday. Under his lead, the counterculture media group will focus on its original documentaries, dramas and podcasts – like its popular British crime drama “Gangs of London” or film “Bama Rush” about the sorority recruitment process at the University of Alabama. The focus is on “storytelling that can build a long-term, profitable and sustainable media brand in today’s landscape,” Stotsky told the Wall Street Journal. Bruce Dixon, who served as chief executive at Vice since February 2023, will leave the company. He executed layoffs and focused on cutting costs during his time at Vice, which was acquired by Fortress Investment Group and Soros Fund Management after it filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Dixon last year announced plans to stop publishing content on Vice.com and sell assets like Refinery29, its media site geared toward young women, and British fashion magazine i-D. “A lot of the sort of messy stuff has been cleaned up,” Stotsky told the Journal. Now Vice, which was founded in 1994, is profitable and looking to transform its studio business into a major revenue stream, according to Michael Lang, Vice’s executive chairman and president of Lang Media Group. Stotsky has spent about three decades working in entertainment television, serving as chief marketing officer at NBCUniversal and later as president of Esquire Network and then E! Entertainment. More recently, he led Dick Clark Productions, which is now owned by Penske Media, and helped Religion of Sports, the sports media venture founded by Tom Brady, Michael Strahan and Gotham Chopra, raise $50 million in an equity round. That doesn’t mean Vice expects smooth-sailing from here on out. “It’s going to be really tough for us to compete against Instagram, TikTok and YouTube,” Lang told the Journal. “So we’re going to create great content for digital platforms, but we’re not going to be in the digital platform business itself.” The CEO shake-up follows the hiring of Amy Powell, a former Amazon and Paramount executive, to serve as president of Vice Studios. The company also plans to expand its Virtue ad agency’s presence in Europe and focus on news podcasts, like “Shane Smith Has Questions,” hosted by Vice co-founder Shane Smith. Vice has also pushed several new sports series, like “Calipari: Razor’s Edge,” a partnership with Peyton Manning’s Omaha Productions about basketball coach John Calipari’s first season at the University of Arkansas. It has a new series expected to launch this September called “NFL Playback,” which adds fresh commentary from celebrities and players, like Manning, to classic games. Advertisement

Title: Cannes Lions Gathers Ad Business As WPP Media Report Flags Challenges

ByHoward Homonoff ByHoward Homonoff, Contributor. CANNES, FRANCE - JUNE 20: Actress, award-winning playwright and UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Danai ... More Gurira speaks onstage at Debussy Theatre during the 'Smashing Stereotypes with Danai Gurira' session at Cannes Lions on June 20, 2023 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Richard Bord/Getty Images for Unstereotype Alliance) As the ad industry kicks off the annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, the sunny climate of the Cote d’Azur can’t mask the storm clouds that surround many in the business. WPP Media’s latest report certainly doesn’t provide a completely dour forecast, but it does highlight the gravity of challenges confronting marketers, agencies, publishers and their employees. The WPP Media midyear forecast projects over $1 trillion in total 2025 ad revenue, an increase of 6% from 2024. This isn’t a bad number in the context of our current global political, cultural and environmental upheaval. But it is a drop of 22% from WPP Media’s predicted growth of 7.7% just six months ago, and the report downgrades its growth expectations going forward not only for 2025 but for the next five years as well. The report notes the “increasingly opaque economic environment [in which] many marketers have appeared to take a wait-and-see approach.” That’s hardly a formula for a robust upfront market for U.S. ad sellers. And traditional TV is hardly fertile ground for any rising tide of advertising, as cable TV network revenue fell nearly 7% between 2023 and 2024, undoubtedly one of the factors driving major ad sellers in the traditional TV world to restructure themselves. WPP Media itself has undergone a tumultuous last couple of years – including the recent announcement that Mark Read, CEO of WPP itself, is leaving the company. WPP Media, WPP’s media buying arm, is still the world’s largest media buyer, but it ditched the familiar GroupM brand name and folded leadership of its agencies – Mindshare, Wavemaker and EssenceMediacom – into one central organization. The reorganized company has announced layoffs and recently lost several significant clients to Publicis. Of course, ad industry disruption is hardly limited to WPP Media. No matter the environment, WPP Media’s new forecast provides a number of timely insights around the ad business today and its pathway forward, and I spent some time with its author, Kate Scott-Dawkins, Global President of Business Intelligence for WPP Media. The sweep of the midyear forecast, including its global geography, millions of measurable media data points, and perspectives on the latest developments in AI, provides what WPP Media aims to be “a comprehensive view of advertising [today]…providing a fresh perspective and some impetus for thinking about the future in a different way and and how that applies to [our clients’] business." This makes Scott-Dawkins’ job, as she jokingly noted, “to know everything about everything because everybody advertises.” I don’t have quite the same pressure, so I’ll pick out just a few additional takeaways from the forecast. One aspect of the forecast that has garnered a good deal of attention is the growth in creator-driven ad revenue relative to more traditional media outlets such as TV, audio, and print. Some definitional level-sets might make sense. Of the $1 trillion universe of ad revenue in 2025, WPP Media projects that 58% or $625 billion will go towards “content-driven advertising revenue” (think most everything but search and ecommerce). And inside of that category, WPP Media forecasts that in 2025, for the first time, “creator-driven” ad revenue (on or from user-generated content platforms, companies and creators) will surpass that of traditional professionally-produced content platforms. As the report acknowledges, these categories are getting harder and harder to separate effectively. By 2030, WPP Media projects that this creator-driven ad revenue will top $376 billion globally. Did traditional media need yet another challenging data point? The influencer/creator economy is hardly new, but its accelerating scale demonstrates its inextricable integration into the broad ad marketplace. The WPP Media report doesn’t provide much light at the end of the tunnel of Big Tech’s ad revenue dominance. According to the report, the top 25 global media owners, running from Google through U.S. media companies through China’s Xiaomi Global, accounted for 70% of all ad revenues in 2024. And just five companies - Google, Meta (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp), ByteDance (TikTok’s owner), Amazon and Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba - accounted for 54% of all ad revenues by themselves. Amazon alone ($55.9 billion) took in more in ad revenue than the combination of all five of the major U.S. media companies (Comcast, Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox). And looking forward, it’s not going to get easier as WPP Media projects that the digital advertising share of ad revenues (think anything but traditional video and audio) will rise from 73% in 2025 to over 87% in 2030. There are no conversations about media, advertising or most anything else these days that don’t touch on AI, so of course, This Year Next Year had to provide insights on developments in that area as well. The challenge, as Scott-Dawkins noted, is “how are you going to cover this momentous revolution in a way that feels comprehensive and not obsolete as soon as we published?” In search ad revenue, or what WPP Media here calls “Intelligence Advertising,” the report sees 7.4% growth in 2025. But as the forecast notes this includes not just traditional Google-dominated search but “answer engines” such as OpenAI, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Grok and Anthropic. The hope that ChatGPT and AI-driven platforms might weaken the Big Tech ad revenue stranglehold may be proving illusory. For better or worse, publishers have long been desperately dependent on traditional Google searches to drive clicks and traffic to their sites. Google’s introduction of AI tools such as AI Overviews, obviating the need for consumers to click on Google’s blue web links, has combined with increased AI-based searches to bring about declines in publisher site traffic over the last several years as much as 50% or higher. To paraphrase what Sally once told Harry: “You can’t take it back. It’s already out there.” At least the Rosé will be plentiful at Cannes Lions.

yj - stock.adobe.com In its latest effort to solidify its healthcare ambitions, Amazon is restructuring its healthcare business into six new units, the tech giant confirmed in an email to Virtual Healthcare. The new Amazon Health Services (AHS) units are: "We have made recent changes to simplify our structure, reduce layers, and elevate tenured leaders across six teams," said Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, in the email. "These updates reflect a broader strategy to better deliver for patients and accelerate innovation across the business. We're excited about the continued momentum across Amazon Health Services, and remain deeply committed to our mission of making healthcare easier." Additionally, Amazon announced that One Medical COO Ann Allen will move into a new role managing existing health system partner relationships and strategic alignment. The COO position will be backfilled. This move comes a few months after Amazon One Medical CEO Trent Green departed two years into his tenure as head of the primary care organization. CNBC reported several other Amazon leadership exits in recent months, including Vin Gupta, MD, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, who left in February, Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, who departed in May and Sunita Mishra, MD, Amazon's chief medical officer, who also left in May. The restructuring also follows a round of layoffs across One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy last year, several changes to Amazon's virtual care service and the shuttering of the Amazon-J.P. Morgan-Berkshire Hathaway joint venture. Anuja Vaidya has covered the healthcare industry since 2012. She currently covers the virtual healthcare landscape, including telehealth, remote patient monitoring and digital therapeutics.

Get the checklist now and start reclaiming your space on the SERP, one AI-first keyword at a time. This template is your no-nonsense roadmap to a flexible, agile social media strategy. Discover the exact strategies top brands use to boost revenue, without the guesswork. CMOs must address 10 pressing issues, including AI integration, Google’s evolving SERPs, data privacy, and content differentiation Right now, CMOs are navigating a fast-moving environment, marked by economic pressures, new technologies, and shifting consumer expectations. The pressure to demonstrate impact while adapting to new platforms, regulations, and expectations has never been greater. For marketing leaders, this means constantly adjusting strategies to stay competitive and relevant. To prepare for the marketing equivalent of the Olympic high hurdles, the article below outlines the 10 key hurdles that CMOs must overcome in 2025 and beyond. Economic volatility and tighter marketing budgets are forcing CMOs to do more with less. Although most are asked to show the return on investment of marketing expenditures, the right metric to use is return on marketing investment (ROMI). While both are measures of profitability, ROI measures money that is “tied up” in plants and inventories (which are capital expenditures or CAPEX), while ROMI measures money spent on marketing in the current quarter (which are operational expenditures or OPEX). The formula for calculating ROMI is: (Incremental Revenue from Marketing × Contribution Margin – Marketing Spend) / Marketing Spend = ROMI For example, Amazon reportedly paid MrBeast $100 million to produce the first season of his reality show “Beast Games.” MrBeast says he’s lost “tens of millions” producing the show. But how does Amazon’s CMO, Julia White, calculate the ROMI for “Beast Games,” which launched in November 2024? Let’s say the estimated lifetime value of an Amazon Prime member is around $2,000, and a scientific wild-ass guess (SWAG) for the paid membership program’s contribution margin is about 12.5%. So, “Beast Games” needs to generate roughly $2 billion in incremental revenue for Amazon Prime to get a ROMI of 1.5. Here’s how to calculate that: [$2 billion × 12.5% – $100 million] / $100 million = 1.5 That means “Beast Games” needs to generate a million new Amazon Prime members for the paid membership program to get $1.50 in profit for every $1.00 it spends on MrBeast. CMOs should read Kevin Indig’s article, “The First-Ever UX Study Of Google’s AI Overviews: The Data We’ve All Been Waiting For,” which paints the most significant new picture of how people use Google that I’ve seen since Gord Hotchkiss, the former CEO of Enquiro, produced his first search engine user eye tracking study back in 2007. Indig’s groundbreaking usability study, which was conducted with Eric van Buskirk and his team, analyzed how 70 users interact with Google’s AI Overviews (AIOs), involving nearly 400 AIO encounters. The findings reveal that AIOs significantly reduce outbound clicks: desktop click-through rates (CTR) can fall by two-thirds, and mobile CTR by almost half. Most users (70%) only read the top third of an AIO, with a median scroll depth of 30%. Trust in AIOs correlates with scroll depth. Younger mobile users (25-34) are more likely to accept AIOs as final answers (50% of queries). Brand authority is now the primary decision filter, followed by relevance. When users do click out after viewing an AIO, about a third of that traffic goes to community forums like Reddit and videos on YouTube. The study concludes that search is shifting from a “click economy” to a “visibility economy,” where being cited high in an AIO is crucial, as users treat AIOs like quickly scanned fact sheets. CMOs should also watch the IMHO interview with Indig that Search Engine Journal’s Shelley Walsh recorded about his research. CMOs also face the challenge of addressing changing customer interests throughout their multichannel journeys. To overcome this high hurdle, a recent SparkToro article said that true audience research needs to go beyond basic demographics or keywords. This requires delving into what genuinely interests consumers, the specific language they use, their motivations, and potential barriers to action. Understanding where they spend their time online and which information sources they trust is also crucial. For example, Jeff Baker and his partners created Beach Commute, a startup aimed at the “location-independent” community. Their primary challenge was identifying the correct terminology and phrases used by professionals seeking a location-independent lifestyle, since their target audience is still developing and lacks standardized language. This made it difficult to connect with potential users through traditional keyword research, since search terms were varied and intent was often unclear. For example, “work and travel” often led to individuals seeking work-exchange programs rather than career-focused remote work. Beach Commute used SparkToro to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior and search intent. By comparing potential homepage keyword targets like “become a digital nomad” and “make money while traveling,” SparkToro revealed distinct audience motivations. The “digital nomad” audience was more interested in aspirational travel and advice, aligning better with Beach Commute’s offerings. In contrast, the “money and travel” group focused on entrepreneurial “hacks.” This data allowed Beach Commute to refine its keyword strategy and effectively target the right audience. CMOs are also tasked with strategically integrating AI to enhance marketing effectiveness, drive efficiency, and enable hyper-personalization. But how do their teams balance AI capabilities with human creativity? For over a quarter-century, the PODS container has served as a mobile advertisement across American streets, acting as a constant reminder of the brand. In a recent initiative, Tombras, the creative agency for PODS, collaborated with Google Gemini to transform one of its containers into the “World’s Smartest Billboard.” This innovative billboard was designed to be aware of its surroundings, capable of identifying its precise location, the current time, prevailing traffic conditions, weather patterns, and even subway delays. Leveraging this data, the smart billboard could generate and display highly specific and relevant messages for each neighborhood it was in, all in real-time. As part of an ambitious demonstration, the team undertook the challenge of taking this intelligent billboard to every single neighborhood in New York City within a tight 29-hour timeframe. This feat, considered humanly impossible, was achieved through the combined efforts of human creativity and AI. The creative team worked closely with Google Gemini to ensure the AI could replicate the company’s distinct tone and content style on a massive scale. This collaboration resulted in the creation and instant display of over 6,000 hyper-local, real-time ads on the PODS container. The project highlights the remarkable outcomes that can be achieved when creative professionals, advanced multimodal AI, and a moving company join forces. CMOs are increasingly expected to drive business growth, necessitating a close alignment of marketing strategies with overall company goals like revenue generation and market expansion. It requires CMOs to demonstrate marketing’s financial contribution and, as Avinash Kaushik advises, refine their use of dashboards and scorecards. In an Occam’s Razor article, Kaushik highlights that CMOs often track non-essential metrics, leading to data overload. To counter this, he proposes categorizing data into key performance indicators (KPIs), diagnostic metrics, and influencing variables. This framework helps focus senior leadership on critical business impacts, particularly profits, while allowing teams to manage tactical optimizations separately. This strategic approach to data aims to clarify what truly matters for achieving business objectives, distinguishing between strategic measures and in-flight tactical adjustments. Despite its apparent simplicity, Kaushik notes that many marketing teams struggle with this differentiation, prompting him to outline distinct characteristics for each category across eleven factors. For example, Hilton and Dentsu Americas collaborated on the “For The Stay” campaign, using video as a central element of their marketing efforts. A key question they sought to answer, according to Hilton’s Rebecca Panico, was how to effectively tailor creative content to specific audiences. By doing so, they achieved substantial growth in brand awareness, customer consideration, purchase intent, and booking conversions, demonstrating the effectiveness of their strategy in a changing travel market. In an increasingly crowded digital space, producing high-quality, engaging, and differentiated content consistently is a major hurdle, especially with limited resources. With the rise of AI-generated content, the emphasis on authentic, human-crafted storytelling and unique brand messaging becomes even more critical to stand out. To surmount this hurdle, CMOs should start by reading AI & Creators: The future of Tech and Creativity, which provides an in-depth exploration of the current and future effects of generative AI on creator businesses. To support this, YouTube conducted its largest global survey to date, examining how creators around the world are integrating Gen AI into their work. Then, CMOs should read Your Brandcast 2025 recap: Culture, creators, and commerce. At the event, YouTube celebrated its 20th anniversary, highlighting its evolution as a dominant media platform and “the new TV.” Brandcast 2025 also emphasized the growing impact of creators on culture and commerce, noting that 81% of U.S. viewers use creator content for product discovery, and YouTube ads deliver a 4.5X higher return on ad spend than other streaming TV. YouTube also unveiled new advertising innovations for Connected TV (CTV). These include Cultural Moments Sponsorships for major events, and “Peak Points” powered by Google AI to place ads during peak audience engagement. Additionally, new immersive Masthead ads and Shoppable CTV features aim to drive awareness and action directly from the living room, connecting creators, fans, and brands across all viewing experiences. In today’s climate of consumer skepticism and the prevalence of cancel culture, maintaining brand trust and authenticity has become increasingly difficult. CMOs must ensure that brand messaging remains consistent, transparent, and aligned with a company’s core values and behaviors. For example, Kantar’s May 2025 Monthly Trends Report says transparency, particularly around data usage, can offer a competitive edge in a world marked by extreme disruption and uncertainty. This volatile environment is not entirely new. For years, critiques of globalized commerce and culture have been gaining momentum from both ends of the political spectrum: the left condemns cultural imperialism, while right-wing populism has grown since the Great Recession. These long-standing tensions have intensified recently, with inflation, COVID-19, climate change, and war disrupting the marketplace. Tariff threats have added further strain, placing American brands under heightened scrutiny. Historically, brands functioned within a relatively stable ecosystem of supply chains, digital media, and retail consolidation, largely removed from political turmoil. Today, however, they find themselves entangled in it, struggling to preserve brand equity and market share. Kantar research highlights a rise in anti-American sentiment due to tariffs, yet paradoxically shows American brands are stronger and more valuable than ever. Despite this resilience, future stability is uncertain. The challenge for brands is not merely survival but sustained growth, which is becoming increasingly rare. To thrive, CMOs must resist the temptation to retreat under pressure and instead focus on consistently adding consumer value – offering more reasons to engage, not fewer. With the decline of third-party cookies and the strengthening of data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, CMOs face the critical challenge of ethically managing customer data. This involves prioritizing the collection of first-party and zero-party data, ensuring transparency in data usage, and investing in secure platforms to build and maintain customer trust. How do CMOs overcome this high hurdle while outrunning their competitors? They should start by reading Google Analytics Adds New Features For Privacy-Era Tracking. Google has updated Google Analytics to improve data accuracy and help marketers identify issues faster, adapting to evolving privacy rules. Key enhancements include “Aggregate Identifiers” to prevent misattribution of paid traffic when Google Click Identifiers (GCLID) are unavailable, and “Smart Fallback Methods” using UTM tags as a backup. CMOs should then read, “Where Are The Missing Data Holes In GA4 That Brands Need?” This article highlights that Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data, while useful, often misses crucial information about initial user acquisition, like how users first discover a brand. SEO professionals should use audience research and surveys to understand these “missing bullet holes” and verify their GA4 interpretations. The shift to hybrid work environments and the rapid evolution of marketing technologies necessitate innovative approaches to talent management. CMOs face the challenge of attracting, retaining, and developing top marketing talent with the right skills, particularly in areas like AI, data analytics, and digital transformation. Fostering a formidable team culture and providing continuous learning opportunities are the keys to avoiding tripping over this hurdle. But CMOs should also read “I’m a LinkedIn Executive. I See the Bottom Rung of the Career Ladder Breaking.” According to Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, AI increasingly threatens entry-level jobs, traditionally crucial for young workers to gain experience. This mirrors past manufacturing declines, now impacting office roles in tech, law, and customer service, where AI automates basic tasks. Data shows rising unemployment for recent graduates, with Gen Z being particularly pessimistic about their futures. While AI will also create new jobs, and executives still value fresh perspectives, the loss of entry-level positions can significantly hinder early career development and exacerbate inequality. To address this, the essay proposes reimagining entry-level work. This includes training workers in AI-relevant skills and redesigning jobs to offer higher-level tasks, leveraging AI as a tool for growth and adaptability rather than mere automation. Finally, marketing can no longer operate in a silo. Effective CMOs must champion cross-functional collaboration to ensure cohesive strategies and a unified customer experience. This may be the hardest obstacle to overcome because it requires CMOs to unlearn what they have learned about the marketing department organization. The most common organizational structure for marketing departments is called “functional” – because it puts distinct functions into different departments. But this creates dysfunctional silos with limited flexibility to adapt quickly or effectively to changes in market demand. What’s the alternative? CMOs can organize their marketing teams by market segments, target audiences, or groups of people with specific interests, intents, and demographics. This customer-centric organizational structure ensures that all their marketing teams are focused on putting customer needs and interests first in every interaction with the brand. It also improves the likelihood that each team will understand their customers’ needs, concerns, and desires, and tailor marketing efforts to deliver value and exceptional experiences. Now, I realize that most marketers mistakenly believe “reorgs” are bad, but reorganizations are infinitely less terrible than “layoffs.” I also realize that most agencies dread “reorgs” because these often trigger “agency reviews.” But agencies should focus on delivering value, rather than simply providing services, to stand out and achieve long-term success. This means moving beyond traditional service models and offering solutions that directly address client business needs and lead to measurable results. To successfully navigate these 10 key hurdles, CMOs must become master jugglers, balancing technology with creativity, short-term performance with long-term brand building, and data-driven insights with authentic customer connections. By addressing these critical hurdles, from adapting to AI-powered search to building consumer trust in a privacy-first world, marketing leaders can future-proof their organizations and drive meaningful growth. Marketing is more complex than ever, but there is plenty of opportunity if you can move quickly, think strategically, and lead cross-functional teams with clarity and purpose.

He claims to have been working with Palm closely for a year, yet he somehow must have missed how bad things were. The product was a week or two away from launch when he had to step away. To me it sounds like the bad decisions had already been made. reply They didn't have the app ecosystem - no surprise. However the only way to get that ecosystem is years of investment. The Windows phone failed a couple years latter for similar reasons - nice device (or so I'm told), but it wasn't out long enough to get a lot of apps before Microsoft gave up on it. reply Shout out to the Itanium sales forecast: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Itanium_... reply (This version of the graph is pretty old, but it's enough to get the flavor. The rate of new installations is still increasing exponentially, and the IEA continues to predict that it'll level off any day now...) reply (It’s hard to harvest more power from a star than a Dyson sphere is capable of) reply reply So, yeah, in a few years they'll be right. Even if for just a short time while the rest of the economy grows to keep up with the change. reply reply reply an AMD alternative wasn't even a blip on the radar Aside from it not being 64bit initially uh.. did we live through the same time period? The Athlons completely blew the Intel competition out of the water. If Intel hadn't heavily engaged in market manipulation, AMD would have taken a huge bite out of their marketshare. reply reply reply I'm well aware of Opteron's impact. In fact, the event when that info was related to me, was partly held for me to scare the hell out of Intel sales folks. But 64-bit wasn't really part of the equation. Long time ago and not really disposed to dig into timelines. But multi-core was an issue for Intel before they were forced to respond with Yamhill to AMD's 64-bit extensions to x86. reply That's one way to explain it. Alternatively, one might say that FSB-based Netburst servers would not benefit much from multi-core because the architecture (and especially FSB) has hit its limitation. Arguably, Intel had no competitive product on the mass server market until 2006 and Core-based Xeon 5100 introduction. Only enormous market inertia has kept them afloat.> In the 64-bit server space, which is really what's relevant to this discussion, AMD was pretty much not part of the discussion until Dell (might have been Compaq at the time) and Sun picked them up as a supplier in the fairly late 2000s.That was one relatively small (servers number-wise) segment of the market. Introduction of Opteron servers and Windows Server 2003 64-bit has created a new segment of mass 64-bit servers which have very quickly taken over entire 32-bit (at that time) mass server market. That was the real market that Intel wanted for themselves with introduction of proprietary Itanium but failed to acquire it because of the compatibility issue. High-end mainframe-adjacent market segment indeed belonged to Itanium for many years after, but that wasn't the goal of Itanium. Intel wanted to be a monopoly on the entire PC&server market with no cross-licensing agreements but failed and had to cross-license AMD64 instead. > In the 64-bit server space, which is really what's relevant to this discussion, AMD was pretty much not part of the discussion until Dell (might have been Compaq at the time) and Sun picked them up as a supplier in the fairly late 2000s.That was one relatively small (servers number-wise) segment of the market.

I literally laughed out loud. At that price, gasoline would be about $18/gal and no one could afford to move anything except by ox cart. reply Just for some rough math here - I’m currently paying around $1.20/L for gas, and crude oil cost is roughly half of that, so if crude went up by 6x, I’d be looking at $5/L for gas. Gas is currently about 20% of my per-km cost of driving, so that price increase at the pump would increase my per-km cost by about 60%.FWIW that’s roughly the same per-km cost increase that people have voluntarily taken on over the past decade in North America by buying more expensive cars.(Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) FWIW that’s roughly the same per-km cost increase that people have voluntarily taken on over the past decade in North America by buying more expensive cars.(Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) (Though this does apply to personal transportation only, the math on e.g. transport trucks is different) reply I drive electric so like to imagine myself sheltered from gas price increases but I know grocery costs would explode reply reply reply Not to mention less efficient cars. reply reply reply reply I googled for a couple sources on the breakdown of the price of gasoline, and they seemed to be in agreement that the raw cost of crude is somewhere around half.

X86 compatibility mattered so much back then because people had tons of code they couldn’t easily modify whereas later switches like Apple’s PPC-x86 or x86-ARM and Microsoft’s recent ARM attempts seem to be a lot smoother because almost everyone is relying on many of the same open source libraries and compilers.

I thought the author was actually overly generous to Apotheker - the Autonomy acquisition was a total failure of leadership and due diligence, and if Apotheker was the "software guy" he was supposed to be then the Autonomy failure makes him look even worse. reply The board then hired Apotheker whose grand strategy was to sell everything including the printer business and buy Autonomy a hot British company. The board signed off on this. It is the equivalent of selling your farm and tractor for some magical beans. reply reply While Henning may not have been particularly business-savvy, Leo demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of SAP’s value network and how software should be build.

The HP board hired a CEO whose largest organizational experience was running a company smaller than HP's smallest division. Based purely on revenue management experience, Apotheker wouldn't have qualified to be a Executive Vice President at HP, yet the board put him in charge of a $125 billion technology company.> This wasn't just a cultural mismatch—it was a fundamental scale and complexity mismatch that should have been immediately obvious to any functioning board. But nobody asked the right questions about whether Leo's enterprise software background prepared him to evaluate consumer platform technologies such as WebOS, and I wasn't there to provide what my colleagues called "adult supervision."Yup, sounds about right.At some point "management" and "executive management" started (falsely) being viewed as their own dedicated skillset that is independent and unrelated to the business itself, when in reality they still require specific understanding of the skills and processes over which they preside.

The web tech basically worked fine. However the bugginess and challenging user interface (which is actually standard today) was a huge issue. The leadership decision that was needed wasn’t to kill the touchpad 49 days after launch, it was to kill it before launch.Palm was a raccoon backed into a corner and it was using all its cleverness to get out. But it was willing to ship stuff that wasn’t ready and couldn’t be ready with the resources we had. HP had the resources. They could have taken a good start and given it the space to become great. Maybe. Palm was a raccoon backed into a corner and it was using all its cleverness to get out. But it was willing to ship stuff that wasn’t ready and couldn’t be ready with the resources we had.

The ex-Palm folks lead or are technical leaders at many mainstream unix-ish OSes today, plus Fuschia (Android, Apple, Chrome, Fuschia)- Boot times weren't the highest priority (though we did spend time on it since they were _so bad_). Battery life was. We didn't even do that well by launch date, but if Android hadn't mainlined their power-management framework before the Pre launched it would have been a joke. It was all hands on deck to get that stuff integrated in time for launch.- The webOS platform was actually a thin UI layer on top of an Android-like Java-based platform that never launched. The Java-based OS wasn't derivative of Android (it predated Android), but it had no differentiating features with Android already live. Booting the Java runtime _and_ the JS engine and webkit was a lot.- We knew we couldn't have Java running on this phone long-term, so tons of effort was going into nascent node services instead of Java ones. So all those were launching too.- Your memory is incorrect on the JS jit, or mine is. My memory is that we were adopting the latest v8 engines as fast as they would come out (although not as fast as chrome) because they were the only ones that could keep the thing performant.- Webkit was a mess, I'll give you that, but I'm surprised you noticed. Were you at palm too? Did you build apps? We generally provided UI components that were the way to build apps that, hopefully, allowed you to ignore the intricacies of exactly which webkit version you were on (at least to build an app). - Boot times weren't the highest priority (though we did spend time on it since they were _so bad_).

I used to run mine at 1.7-2GHz without any trouble (aside from battery life).Maybe I'm wrong about the JIT, but as I recall, the JS benchmarks under webOS were significantly worse than Android (preware ultimately wasn't enough to keep up with things and LuneOS wasn't really viable without a lot of effort, so dual-booting to Android extended the life of the tablet for quite a while).I wasn't at Palm, but it was noticeable during browsing (especially vs Android) and was extremely noticeable when it came to missing features.

If WebOS sucks I believe it's more because it simply doesn't get enough development attention.Fundamentally Android also sucks but they've managed to hammer it into the platform that it is today. The same could be said for Windows. Look at Linux, fundamentally a sound platform, but nobody is there hammer the rough edges to success.

Many people do anyway, just directly in the browser and with electron. Easier on a PC, but completely possible on TVs and phones. If webOS is slow now on your TV that's because of LG's development capabilities, not because of the technology.I had both a Touchpad and a HP Veer. The performance was completely fine, especially after the mod scene provided kernel updates with overclocks, plus tunings for the UI. Especially compared to common devices of the time. Those were very good signs for the cut next hardware iteration.The great thing about webOS was the usability, just how the interface worked was awesome. It's no accident that Android copied the card interface a few years later, with Android 5 I think, and the gestures again a few years later, with Android 10 or 11. Probably coming from Palm were also some nice ideas about how to integrate apps and core functionality. I had both a Touchpad and a HP Veer.

Sideloading IPK's is limited. I would love to neuter all the ads and auto-updates, that's my main gripe. The TV is a lot more locked down and filled with ads, but still snappy.

But, fast access to settings and inputs is sorta nice too. reply It's about the least snappy thing I've ever used, apart from cheap Android tablets (we made the mistake of buying an Amazon Fire Kids tablet which is the only device I've ever used that was literally unusably slow).I even bought the higher spec version of the TV because apparently the cheaper version is even slower.

(Reviews were mostly promising, and positive leaning -- check out something like Anandtech's review). The problem was trying to compete with Apple on both product and price -- which no one could do back at that time.An HP TouchPad that had launched with no immediate margin, would have been able to get a foothold and slowly secure Palm a 2nd place position. (TouchPad's launched with a slightly-rushed slightly-buggy WebOS, but it wasn't unusable -- they worked pretty well, and they flew off the shelves the second they reduced the price)A HP TouchPad that had to match an iPad for features, polish, and still command an iPad's premium pricing -- simply couldn't. But that's a really high bar no one could regularly do -- even today, you don't see strong/popular alternatives to the iPad, unless you move upmarket enough to get into the laptop market (like say, a Surface Pro).The problem wasn't "the product shipped and wasn't perfect". The problem was, "we're trying to gain a foothold in this market, and we need more dedication and patience to nail it" -- and being in the market for less than two months wasn't ever going to be enough to do that.Leadership needs to buy in on strategy, if you want it to execute well.

He sort of implies his work was great and it was marketing/other departments who messed up. reply I wouldn't even call this rushed to market, though expectations were likely too high for reality. Still it takes years of investment to build a platform like this. reply I remember Phil and rather liked him. Everything he states in the article is correct as far as I remember it. Yes we were being slammed by the iPad, but we were far and away the #2 tablet that summer. Android tablets really sucked then, and despite Google's push there were more tablet native apps in the TouchPad app store than Android's. In hindsight it should have been cheaper and faster. And it would have been by Christmas (the TouchPad mini was just weeks away from shipping). Given more time and funding it would have been a contender (maybe not "winning" but still having a good run).I suspect Palm was doomed the moment Apotheker took over. He wanted to turn HP into IBM.

The damage 1 person can do in less than a year is astonishing. He even proposed selling off the PC division. WebOS was a fairly new acquisition and very well could have been the future, but he couldn't see any vision outside of software with his background. HP was built on hardware, they did't need to pivot that hard. It seems the stockholders agreed. reply reply I kind of wonder if Apple could pull off something like an iphone or an ipad or even an ipod these days, without Steve Jobs around. reply reply reply reply reply reply reply And I think that there's an unstated major premise behind, "what purpose did you acquire the company for?" It assumes the existing product portfolio is already in great shape and running well. Except, it's probably better to assume the opposite. Companies that are ticking along smoothly like that don't tend to be the ones that are up for sale. So usually the acquiring company's thesis needs to be something like, "we think the technology is sound but it's having problems with product/market fit that we are uniquely positioned to solve for them." And that's a thesis that directly implies changes to the existing product portfolio. reply While it's less clear cut now, back when HP acquired WebOS, they would've had to put in a lot of work to make WebOS competitive, and enable WebOS apps to work as well as iOS or Android apps. HP had the resources.We don't have a third or fourth mobile platform mainly because of tragically poor leadership at HP and Nokia.

The UI as shipped was already ahead of its time and if you look around for the cancelled Mocha UI, I think it would look pretty modern even today.The big issue is that they were a web-first platform, but their version of Webkit and JS JIT were years out of date which meant they were behind on web standards and WAY behind on JS performance at a time when JITs were still getting faster at a very rapid pace. The CPU was fast compared to everyone else, but it was still slow and they needed to focus on performance a bit more.

To be successful you have to leapfrog the competition. You need to offer something so compelling that consumers are willing to put up with the inconvenience of the lack of ecosystem. This is why WebOS and BlackBerry 10 failed. They were as good as iOS and Android but not good enough to overcome that massive downside.This is also why Apple managed to get a foothold even though established players like Nokia and RIM had the market cornered. Instead of catching up to the competition they leapfrogged them. This is also why Apple managed to get a foothold even though established players like Nokia and RIM had the market cornered.

Even before Apotheker, HP was rushing to follow IBM's business model and leave consumers behind.Also, don't forget Blackberry hadn't even yet peaked as a "business" phone - HP was clearly chasing this market instead of the adoring consumer market that Palm had collected.

I think it's at least plausible that Apple and HP's legal departments had some discussions about the TouchPad which remain under NDA to this day.WebOS was so far ahead of it's time in terms of usability and features in the default applications that it's hard to imagine someone dense enough to opt out of owning the mobile platform over the next several decades voluntarily.But I can imagine an emergency operation to avoid all out legal warfare with Cupertino.

When Touchpad launched 3-4 months later, it was twice as thick with worse battery life and a lot fewer apps were available while it had more bugs.I think this was the real reason.HP could have overcome all of these issues if they'd just given the hardware/software teams more time to finish the software and make thinner hardware.The could have been a big player in the phone, tablet, TV, and even laptop market if they'd stuck with it.

Tapping into Apple's ecosystem in such a way is exactly the sort of action Apple dislikes, for obvious reasons. reply In my opinion, Touchpad's different edges, corners, and radically different software meant HP wasn't likely to get sued. reply It's well documented that mobile is a minefield of lawsuits seemingly aimed not so much at winning as at establishing cross-licensing agreements to mitigate the massive patent warchests of established players. A practice Apple has proven to be adept at. Just entering the mobile space carries a near 100% chance of getting sued by everyone else already occupying it.You can be of the opinion that something isn't worthy of a lawsuit.

The hardware didn't feel as nice as the iPad 2, but it was serviceable. The software was neat and the card metaphor arguably is still more sensible than iOS/iPadOS of today. I can't see any way that HP could've been more than a distant 3rd place behind iOS/Android, but it would've been fun to see them try. reply Ironically this showed that there was demand for webOS. It was just priced wrongly from the outset reply I think the frenzy at the discounted price showed there was demand for a 10" tablet for $99 rather than interest in WebOS. Besides the $499 iPad I don't think there were any other 10" tablets around.People like watching TV and movies on tablets. Not everyone has space or wants a bedroom TV. Not everyone wants to watch whatever their partner or roommates are watching on a living room TV.A 4:3 ratio screen is also much nicer than a 16:9 ratio screen for reading books and PDFs.

Albeit that I was emphasising that people are also happy with something that wasn’t iOS / Android if the price was right. reply reply Their “$500 tablet” could be easily dropped to $100 because it wasn’t a particularly high end device to begin with. I mean, it did have some niceties. But there was also a hell of a lot of corners cut too.Ironically, this was the same problem Palm faced with its WebOS phones before they sold to HP. Their phones were nice but they felt far too sluggish and basic considering their price point. I actually wanted a WebOS phone but ended up with Android (likely HTC) because you got so much more for your money.Given HP (and Palm) has experience building portable devices like PDAs, there really isn’t any excuse for their failing in price and hardware for the WebOS tablets and phones. They already had experience in this market so should have really known better. Ironically, this was the same problem Palm faced with its WebOS phones before they sold to HP.

I assume that when webOS changed hands repeatedly, tons of institutional knowledge about how to actually use it got lost along the way (particularly in the security department).

Perhaps the tablet was launched prematurely; and instead the launch should have focused on app developers? reply Ipad's first release was 4/2010 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation), we're talking a year later to enter the tablet market. Would folks agree that's still a pretty fresh market to enter into? What exactly differentiated PDAs from tablets? reply Apps were built sort of like PhoneGap, but intentional and supported rather than a middleware work-around. webOS introduced the card concept that we all use now, along with a very coherent design language, and the devices were cool (to me, albeit a bit flimsy) with full keyboards (I was super sold on that but have long-since changed my mind after switching to iOS).I came from a long line of "alt" devices though, Sidekick 1, 2, 3, Helio Ocean, etc, so you can see where my sensibilities lie HAHAHAI would also get freakin' roasted by literally everybody I knew every time they saw it for being a hold-out and not getting an iPhone, but iOS just wasn't there yet as far as I was concerned. Apple/Android hadn't cornered the market yet and it was just a time with a lot of options (Blackberry, Windows Phone, etc).Anyways, when I heard HP was buying Palm (and AT&T did a deal for Pre 3 exclusivity, I think), I assumed it would be a great thing for the mass adoption of what seemed like a really exciting future for mobile. Then HP poured gasoline on it and killed it with fire.RIP late-oughts Palm, we barely knew ye!

That merger didn’t work out very well. Later, HP acquired Ross Perot’s EDS, attempting to enter the services business. The integration was, at best, chaotic and took several years.It was a time of turmoil—every other morning you’d receive an email from Mark Hurd announcing layoffs affecting a percentage of employees.Hurd’s focus was on increasing the company’s share value. He aggressively cut staff and reduced R&D investment (one of HP’s strongest traditions), essentially putting HP on life support. For example, HP-UX, which was relevant in the server market at the time, was completely abandoned.When Mark Hurd was fired—accused of using company funds to give gifts to occasional partners (you know what I mean)—he immediately joined Oracle as an advisor, one of HP’s strongest competitors in the enterprise market at the time. Employees saw him as a traitor to the HP brand. Internally, many people hoped things would finally change.What came next was completely unexpected. Leo Apotheker, from SAP, took over. He had this idea of transforming HP into a software and services company, essentially abandoning decades of tradition and letting one of the strongest brands in the industry fade away. He lasted only a few months—it clearly wasn’t working.Then Meg Whitman came in. There was some initial hype around a hardware project called “The Machine,” which was supposed to revolutionize the data center by relying on memory instead of CPU power. That was never released. AWS had already emerged, and HP had no way to compete.Whitman decided to split the company in two: HP (consumer hardware) and HP Enterprise Services (enterprise hardware and services). HP-ES eventually migrated most of its operations to India. Around that time, I accepted a WFR (Workforce Reduction) plan—since it was clear I’d be laid off sooner or later. Later, HP-ES was split again and became DXC Technology for services.It’s incredible how a company that was once one of the strongest brands in the world—a tech giant and market leader for decades—went to hell in just three or four years.

When you switched to another app, the previous app suspended execution entirely. The OS would keep the memory footprint of the app warm in RAM if possible, but back then RAM was in short enough supply that more often than not the memory state of the process was dumped to disk instead.There were lots of clever UX hacks to make this feel seamless - when an app was suspended it was also screenshotted, and the screenshot would be displayed to the user upon switching back, until the actual app could be restored and resume running.But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 There were lots of clever UX hacks to make this feel seamless - when an app was suspended it was also screenshotted, and the screenshot would be displayed to the user upon switching back, until the actual app could be restored and resume running.But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 But the app executable was totally suspended during this time.Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 Whereas on WebOS the UX was oriented around showing multiple "Cards"[1] at the same time, but each one represented a live running process that was able to interact to the user and render new UI.This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 This was a pretty big deal at the time.Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 Since then both iOS and Android gained a lot more capability and nuance around multitasking.[1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 [1] https://www.anandtech.com/show/4508/hp-touchpad-review/2 reply reply That's why those OS were mostly used by geeks and power users, and "regular" users were using feature phones that "just work".One of the strength of iOS and Android were to create a completely different userspace that what we had in desktop OS, more adapted to mobile.

The performance sucked and you killed your battery super quickly.The innovation was in multitasking that didn't result in a terrible user experience, and it took a lot to get there! And the answer wasn't "welp what if we just treated this thing like a desktop".And it's still not a fully solved problem - there continues to be a lot of movement around how apps are defined so that they can be efficiently concurrent!

Basically all the apps were custom, and I vaguely recall there being something close to the home / back on screen button android used in the early days. Heck, it's still a pita to switch apps on my Pixel: swipe up, but not too fast, or it'll bring up the full app list instead of the switcher.But sure, there's plenty to dislike about the n900: it had a resistive touch screen and a stylus. Turn by turn navigation sucked for most of its life. The app store launch was so botched that it was basically dead on arrival. The microusb port sucks.

The phone-UI combination was a masterpiece. But it was still Linux, with all power-user features under the hood. reply reply reply I love this, such a classic hack reply And if you'll excuse more nerding out - a lot of work is being done still to make this even more seamless. For example, iOS now heavily encourages the use of SwiftUI to define UIs, because rendering such UIs can be done by the OS outside of the app process.This means you can have an actual live UI while the actual app process is suspended. They literally don't have to wake the process until you tap on a button.It used to be that your app either got a full-time 60-120Hz runloop, or you got suspended completely. Now the OS can define a much more coarse-grained idea of "alive" without losing interactivity. It's super cool stuff.

One, it would allow large chunks of functionality to be implemented very quickly because the underlying standards were simple, straightforward, and widely understood. Two, Duarte was intrigued by the notion that his designers would be able to apply their handicraft to apps, screens, and UI elements without extensive assistance from engineers, all of whom had other things to worry about.

Title: Farewell to the 'Mad Men' era: Advertising's biggest bash of the year will showcase the industry's seismic changes
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/cannes-lions-2025-what-to-expect-amid-agency-upheaval-ai-2025-6

Advertising executives descending on the French Riviera this week for the annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity will raise their glasses of rosé to toast the twilight of Madison Avenue's glory days. Tom Denford, CEO of the agency search consultancy ID Comms, told me this year's Cannes Lions would be "like a requiem" for the traditional agency business. But that doesn't mean there won't be action. What began as an awards event in the 1950s to celebrate the best ads of the year — affectionately known as "The Work" — has morphed into a sprawling showcase of tech, entertainment, influencers, and every intermediary you can imagine. In recent years, Cannes has featured huge beach takeovers and custom-made event structures from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Meta. The agencies and marketers in attendance are grappling with multiple tectonic shifts all happening at once — from the rise of artificial intelligence to the decline of linear TV, and seemingly never-ending economic uncertainty that makes marketers nervous about long-term budget planning. WPP Media recently cut its 2025 global ad spending growth forecast to 6% from 7.7%, citing "disruptions to global trade and continued deglobalization." While Agencyland's creative class may be nostalgic for the era of showstopping Don Draper-esque pitches, and when cinematic ads won the biggest awards, the industry has shifted its offerings to service clients' changing needs. Retail media isn't the sexy pursuit many executive creative directors dreamed about breaking into the industry for, but it's having a moment. According to the World Advertising Research Center, spending on commerce websites, apps, and in-store displays is projected to overtake linear TV ad spending by 2026. Cannes Lions has introduced a dedicated subcategory for retail media in both its Media and Creative Commerce Lions awards this year. Albertsons is among the companies appearing at the festival this week. The supermarket chain is bringing a grocery store activation to the beach and a team of seven people from its Albertsons Media Collective retail media division. Jen Saenz, Albertsons' EVP and chief commercial officer, said the aim is to showcase what's unique about the grocer's offering for advertisers: "Not just transactions, but brand stories." There have been multiple changes of the guard at the largest ad agency holding companies. Omnicom and IPG are awaiting the closing of their gigantic merger that would create the world's largest advertising agency company by revenue, usurping Publicis, which had only recently toppled WPP's crown. Two of the industry's most high-profile execs — Mark Read, CEO of WPP, and famed ad man David Droga, from Accenture Song — have announced their coming departures. Layoffs have been a sad constant for the rank and file as agencies consolidate. When I asked one ad agency veteran how they envisaged the scene at Cannes this year, they responded: "Type into ChatGPT: Agency exec sitting on corner of the Croisette with cardboard sign around neck saying: Will do creative or plan media for food.'" New independent agencies and big consulting firms are gaining on the traditional holding companies. Industry analyst Brian Wieser recently estimated that the "big six" agency holding companies now have a 30% share of the total US ad agency industry, down from a peak of around 40% in 2015. It's a trend that will be on full display at Cannes Lions next week. Stagwell, the agency group led by former Microsoft strategist and advisor to the Clintons, Mark Penn, is back again with its huge "Sports Beach" activation. It will feature sessions from famed athletes like former world tennis No. 1 Billie Jean King and former NBA legend Carmelo Anthony, as well as activities like a swim club and pickleball tournaments. Accenture Song has a catamaran docked in the harbor to host meetings and has execs speaking onstage at the Palais, where the main conference takes place. Brian Morrissey, the former editor in chief of marketing and media trade publication Digiday, who now writes the media newsletter The Rebooting, has invented a new parlor game for Cannes. He's going to ask everyone he meets to name their favorite ad campaign of the past 12 months. His guess is that most attendees will struggle to instantly conjure one up, despite the fact that advertising is their profession. Morrissey said it's a reflection of the fading relevance in culture of mass media and the 30-second ad spot, as consumer media habits evolve and marketing budgets shift to precision-targeting and performance-marketing. "All the action has moved to the data side of advertising," Morrissey said. (Disclosure: I previously worked for Morrissey at Digiday.) Cannes will remain a decadent affair in 2025, much to the chagrin of the many colleagues back at home who didn't get a golden ticket. (The most expensive pass stretches to more than $12,000 this year — and that's before factoring in travel and accommodation.) Set on the iconic Croisette promenade with its opulent hotels and stunning sea views, some lucky VIPs will be treated to yacht excursions and performances from musical acts including Cardi B, Ludacris, Lola Young, and Diplo. The real A-Listers at Cannes Lions, though, are the chief marketing officers with budgets to spend. Cannes Lions CEO Simon Cook said that more than 350 brands attended last year, and that's expected to rise this year. David Jones, CEO of the Brandtech Group, has some handy advice for marketers who will undoubtedly receive numerous AI sales pitches this coming week. "When someone shows you something great, ask for a login; ask if you can make content and produce it and publish it now to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube," Jones said. "If you can, they have a platform, and if you can't, they have a demo." Jump to

Title: AI Book Club recording and notes for The Singularity is Nearer, by Ray Kurzweil

by Tom Johnson on Jun 15, 2025 categories: ai • ai-book-club • podcasts Here’s a recording of the AI Book Club: A Human in the Loop meeting, held June 15, 2025: If you just want the audio, here it is: Listen here: Here are some of the high-level topics we discussed during the book club. (These are pulled and summarized from the transcript using AI.) Here are some discussion questions I prepared for the book club. We didn’t discuss many of these, but they nonetheless reflect some of the themes and issues that stood out to me. AGI by 2029? Do you really think that by 2029 we’ll reach AGI? That’s really close – just 4 years away. If it happens, how will that change our profession? Accelerating returns cycle? How do some of the information assets we produce create accelerating returns? AI leads to producing more content with greater depth and accuracy. This information then leads to more abundant and rapid use of the technology, as it helps AI tools more quickly implement APIs and other tools/assets, which in turn leads to the development of more technologies. Is this a virtuous cycle of technological advancement? Discuss unprovable futurism? Is there merit in getting so invested or antagonistic in a futurist position that seems so far-fetched as to be unprovable? For example, nanobots rearranging our molecular DNA to create immune responses from virus-type nanobots, or grey-goo scenarios. If something isn’t provable, is it worth truly discussing? Or, due to the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), will these scenarios become near-immediate realities much faster than we realize, catching us unprepared? LOAR and AI? I’m most persuaded by the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR). I think there’s merit to this idea. I had a discussion this morning about how AI is similar to the dot-com boom/hype of the early 2000s. The dot-com boom did lead to a crash, but the internet eventually turned out to be deeply transformative. AI isn’t just potentially similar; it can build on the existing innovation of the web to accelerate even faster, as the web enables better information sharing and distribution. Additionally, the web itself (all the content) provided much of the data needed to train and power LLMs. So I can see a case where these technologies build on each other and, in so doing, accelerate faster and faster. Do you agree with this assessment? Radical life extension? Are we on the verge of radical life extension? If we can just hold out another 10-15 years, will we hit a point of “longevity escape velocity” with our health? What would that mean? Could a technical writer be 250 years old? Singularity, new identity? If we hit a point of the singularity, we will no longer be “tech writers” because we’ll have so much knowledge at our disposal that we could be engineers, doctors, or rocket scientists, etc? The infusion of this knowledge will allow us to transcend this role and move into any other. Do we need to start thinking beyond our current identity to be more ambitious in what we want to undertake? Your singularity age? How old will you be when the singularity (predicted in 2045) takes place? What will society be like when this happens? What if it only partially happens? Acceleration already here? In what sense are we already seeing this rate of acceleration taking place? I feel like every day someone is sharing some new AI-related tool, link, or news with me. It’s certainly coming at an accelerated pace. Will this pace keep up? Workplace acceleration impact? What happens when acceleration starts to become more apparent in the workplace? Technical writers (TWs) will be bombarded with documentation requests, potentially just requests to review documents engineers have already written, etc. TWs will either use AI to keep up or start outsourcing the documentation work to those using AI to build. How are you / will you deal with acceleration? AI divide growing? Do you see a growing divide between those who can access and use AI tools versus those who don’t have access to them, or who have access but don’t know how to use them successfully? For example, if users have access to the top tiers of Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT in their work (tiers costing $200+/month), will this separation start to create a divide between the AI-haves and AI-have-nots? What could you do with access to a top-tier model? What if a model is released at $5,000 a month, such as a powerful agentic model that lets you accomplish all your work while you sleep, or which reduces your existing workload by half, freeing up more of your time to pursue or accelerate other work? Perhaps we’ll start to see more acceleration in individuals, widening the divide. This is a new type of technological divide: not just people who have computers and know how to use them, but people who can access and successfully use advanced AI models. Merging with AI? Kurzweil has said that in many ways, we’re already merging with AI. We carry smartphones in our pockets, and the documents we produce are collaborations with AI (helping us brainstorm, refine our thoughts, articulate our ideas, etc.). As others incorporate these human/machine collaborative products, the AI-based content proliferates and becomes embedded into even more parts of society. As a result, the distinction between human and machine is blurring. Will our close relationship with smartphones, all of which now offer AI in our pockets, accelerate our convergence with AI? AI catastrophe risk? It seems that AI advancements present many new and novel ways for humanity to destroy itself. The grey-goo scenario, where nanobots out of control consume the biosphere in a matter of days, or where rogue actors bioengineer toxins (perhaps tailored to specific DNA profiles) present new avenues for annihilation. We’re lucky that so far, nuclear winter hasn’t happened. But what are the chances that some AI-engineered catastrophe won’t occur, given its increased accessibility and the variety of available scenarios that could lead to many possible attack vectors? Complexity brakes and self-driving cars. Critics mention possible “complexity brakes” interfering with the projected timeline. I think self-driving cars are a good example. A lot of people anticipated that we would have fully autonomous vehicles several years ago, but it didn’t really happen. Only in controlled areas in select cities do we see AVs like Waymo operating. Autonomous driving turned out to be much harder than anything anticipated (for example, Elon keeps saying Tesla Robotaxis are just around the corner). It’s probably the same with many of Kurzweil’s predictions. The Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) will hit many complexity snags that slow acceleration down. Figuratively speaking, maybe accelerating a technology from 0 to 70 mph is somewhat easy, then from 70 - 90 mph much harder, and then from 90-95 mph the most difficult, and 95-100 almost impossible. I’m not sure if the LOAR curve is always exponential. Brain-cloud interface? Connecting our brains to the cloud reminds me of a Black Mirror episode, specifically Season 7, episode 1: “Common People.” A woman has part of her brain removed due to a tumor, but a cloud service can provide similar functionality, connected to online services that stream data to her brain. It’s a pretty compelling episode. Of course, as with nearly every Black Mirror episode, the plot goes dark when the company starts showing ads and upselling services through the person (taking over their brain), and then amplifying her sensory experiences for even more upselling. But the larger point of this episode is to contemplate our merging with AI. Is it likely that an AI service, running on massive cloud computing, could provide a service that in some way connects to a biological component in a human? Utopian or dystopian? Kurzweil’s vision of the future is a techno-utopian one, where technology eliminates disease, economic hardship, and more. It’s an era of abundance and opportunity. In contrast, many others perceive the future as much more dystopian and see many concerns about bleak futures. Do you perceive a techno-utopian future or techno-dystopian future, and why? Hollywood romanticizes the dystopian future for a more compelling storyline, but Kurzweil’s evidence showing advancements during the past 200 years presents a compelling case for continued and accelerating improvements (we live longer, have greater wealth, etc.). Are we overlooking these improvements? If we were to teleport back in time, would our current progress be much more apparent to us? Book’s overall effect? Overall, this book is a refreshing argument in favor of techno-utopianism at a time when we’re seeing more anti-AI books come out. It makes me think we’re only going to see more acceleration, technological innovation, and advancements in the years to come. More readily available expert knowledge will be available. I think we’ll see a growing divide between those who can harness AI for their work and those who can’t. So it makes me want to double down on my AI learning and incorporation, as I think this will position me to ride the wave and learn to navigate what’s to come. What was the overall effect of this book on your perspective? For notes summarizing the book, along with discussion questions, see this Google Doc. The Google Doc organizes information into various tabs (Book summary, Discussion questions, etc.) that appear on the left. I uploaded the summary and discussion questions into NotebookLM and created a “Deep Dive” podcast from it. You can listen here: Listen here: Here’s a transcript of the meeting, with the conversation made more readable through AI: Tom: This is a recording of the AI book club, “A Human in the Loop.” Specifically, we are discussing Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Nearer. This is a discussion among around five people for about an hour where we talk about different topics. A lot of us are tech writers, and some of us are in other roles, but this is basically a recording of a book club discussion. It’s not super focused thematically; it’s a lot of different perspectives, takeaways, and thoughts on Kurzweil’s book. So, enjoy. Tom: Well, let me just go ahead and kick things off here. Welcome to this AI book club. We’ll be talking about Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Nearer. And like the other book club sessions, this is being recorded, and I’ll distribute it afterwards. So just make sure you don’t say anything you don’t want to be heard by other people. That usually doesn’t happen. We have about four people today. Last time, we had probably two or three times that. Unfortunately, I have a bad track record of picking holidays for this. I try to just do a regular, predictable cadence—the third Sunday of the month—and already I’ve hit Easter and Father’s Day. So anyway, Happy Father’s Day to anybody who’s a father out there. Nathan: And you’re a father. Tom: Yeah, I am. Happy Father’s Day to you. I’ve got plans right after this, going to a baseball game with my kids. I don’t even really watch baseball, but it’s kind of fun to go with my kids to a sporting event. So anyway, all right, let’s get into this book. I did share a document. If you didn’t see it, let me just share my screen real quick so you know where all these notes go. I usually provide a notes document right before the book club, and the notes document just has—you can find the link right next to the book in the schedule. And this time, I created a few different things. First of all, I just drafted a big summary because I wanted to make sure I was understanding things. If you’ve never used Gemini Deep Research, or even ChatGPT’s deep research capabilities, it’s probably highly similar. It’s great, and it does a nice job of just summarizing all the main things. And with a book like this that’s so popular, there’s a lot of information online, so you could probably have more confidence in its accuracy. But I mean, if you’ve read the book too, you would know what’s on target and what’s not, and it surprisingly looks good to me. I also added some discussion questions and invited people to add to them if they wanted. These are kind of long and different thoughts, and we can hit them or not. I don’t think anybody added one, but maybe I’m wrong. And then finally, I just added this this morning, but if you haven’t played around with NotebookLM, this is a tremendous amount of fun. It’s notebooklm.google.com. You just upload—in this example, I uploaded the book summary into it—and it generated a 28-minute podcast. And then I just downloaded and uploaded this. But it’s a good way to sort of ramp up on any subject. Now, as people pointed out last time, none of these resources are really what people want, which is they want to know what others think about the book. What do you make of it? Do you agree? Did you like the book? How do you see this sort of applying and playing out in your life or not? So, why don’t we jump into that high-level topic? What did you think of the book? Did you enjoy it? Did you have strong reactions against it? What was your general reception? Mette: I can start with the opening shot. Tom: Go for it. Mette: I liked the book. I didn’t like it as much as the last book by Mustafa Suleyman. I thought he was more—he talked more to an audience that was here and now. It seemed that—and I don’t know how to really pronounce his name, Ray Kurzweil, is that his name? Tom: I actually don’t know either. Kurzweil is my understanding. Mette: Yeah. His book was really centered on maybe not the people right now on Earth, but people maybe, I don’t know, 20, 30 years from now, or 50 years. So I kept on finding myself going, “Okay, buddy, what about us now?” He seemed to do a lot of—his argument often was, “Here’s all the wonderful things that AI is going to do for humanity. Oh, but it’s not going to be so great in the short term.” And I found that to be a continuing theme. Maybe I was in a pessimistic mood. But that said, he could certainly crunch the numbers, and I found that interesting. I don’t know where he got all that information. It’s a whole lot of research he did, certainly very optimistic research. I found the most interesting part of the book to be the bio part because that’s something Suleyman didn’t really go into in great detail, but he went into it in a lot of detail. I’m like, “Oh, okay, that’s what’s going to happen.” Okay. So, what astounded me was that it was all going to be happening pretty much in the 2030s by his predictions. And then on several occasions, he pointed out that he’s always been kind of correct on his predictions. Tom: Yeah, I, wow, you brought up so many great points here. Let’s jump into some of these. The first one you mentioned about the audience: who is he really talking to? And you’re right that he seems to be addressing more of a future audience or not really talking to the people here and now. And yet, his AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) prediction is supposed to land around 2029, which is four years away. I’m like, “Oh my god, that’s, you know, really just a stone’s throw away.” Mette: Yeah. Tom: But I mean, there’s definitely an element of science fiction, it feels, especially when you get into Epoch 6 where the universe wakes up and so on. It’s like, very creative and imaginative, and it’s kind of like, wow, I mean, who knows what that time will look like? But you also brought up the Law of Accelerating Returns, and I agree. I’m kind of taken by that as well. And this whole topic of acceleration is one that I find probably most applicable and most immediate. I know critics have said that he mostly cherry-picks examples from technology as proof, and we don’t really have that same kind of Law of Accelerating Returns in biology and other domains, or even just like airplane travel. So people say we’re hitting complexity brakes in those other areas. But I mean, do you—this is a question I asked my colleagues the other day—do you feel like things are accelerating in your own work? Mette: Yes. Tom: In what ways? Mette: The expectations that are placed on me as a technical writer. It’s, you know, my company is kind but firm. It’s like, if you’re not using AI to show us how you can be twice as efficient or more, then, gee, there might be a different future for you that doesn’t include us. Tom: Wow. Mette: So I mean, it’s very subtle, but it’s there. And they’ve really gotten on the AI bandwagon. So I feel it every day, definitely. Of course, you know, just on my cell phone, I notice all sorts of things. So just apart from work, I see it happening every single day. Tom: It’s interesting to hear feedback from people in other companies about AI momentum and pressure and encouragement. So yeah, that’s really, really fascinating. Do you feel like the work itself has doubled yet? Like if you’re being asked to do twice as much, do you also have twice as many doc requests and projects and things to do as before? Mette: Yeah, and that’s probably because we laid off 40% of our department. Tom: Oh, okay. Mette: Because of AI. Tom: Because of AI, initially? Wow. Wow, you’re really in the—you’re right in this stuff. That’s crazy. Okay. Wow. So they really, they really doubled down on people being twice as productive by laying off— Mette: They really have. Tom: Wow, that’s a trend that I don’t think has really caught on. I mean, I don’t see massive companies laying off half their staff and telling them to just use AI to pick up the slack, but I see it here and there and wonder how much speed it will pick up. Anybody else have any thoughts? Nathan? Nathan: I think, just about companies and the choices they might make, I think AI gives them almost an excuse to shrink their workforce, right? I mean, so whether or not AI is actually making gains in any productivity for a company’s workers, a company can use that as an excuse to shrink their workforce. And there is, you know, I mean, there’s a benefit to the hype of AI, you know, in the way that those companies have said it needs to be regulated, it’s going to get out of control. I mean, there’s some marketing angle to that, I would say. So, you know, for friends of mine who have been laid off for reasons of AI, I definitely sympathize with all those folks, and I think in some cases it’s definitely true, but in some cases as well, there might be some, you know, kind of marketing spin to workforce reductions underneath this AI era. So I just wanted to throw that out there. Tom: That’s a really good point. And I think another point on understanding why companies might be using AI as an excuse to lay people off is also just to justify the massive capital expenditure on all the AI infrastructure and tooling and resources. I mean, you can’t spend billions of dollars and not have a return on investment. So maybe the quickest way to show that is by saying we were able to cut our workforce in half. You have to satisfy Wall Street. Nathan: True. Tom: Anybody else have—go ahead, Liam. Liam: Yeah, well, nice to meet y’all. I work at AWS, and obviously, whatever I share is basically my perspective; working there has nothing to do with my actual work. But we do a lot of work with GenAI, and I think what I was surprised by was how little the phrase “GenAI,” like generative artificial intelligence, was brought up. Ray talks about AI a lot, or AI superintelligence, or artificial general intelligence like you said, Tom. For me, when I think about where it goes in my work, how I feel like things are accelerating—I’m in sales, and so we’re working with a lot of SMB companies. I’m not a technical writer, but I thought what y’all were talking about was fascinating, so I wanted to join. We’re trying to sell the future, kind of. And so there are expectations put on us about what level of adoption and usage customers should be using GenAI for, whether that’s a concrete manufacturer or a digitally native business. And it feels like whether it’s Azure, GCP, Oracle, or AWS, a lot of people are guessing about what level of adoption will be like in day-to-day business. And I would say for me, what’s accelerating is that we’re not seeing agents do my day-to-day work, even though we see Service Now commercials or Salesforce commercials show that. We’re still seeing a lot of manual tasks done by individuals like myself and still trying to find ways, like, how do we move this from—interestingly, it’s commercialized so people use it day-to-day, but it’s not in the actual business. Like, it’s not seeing real business value being driven, at least when I’m working with my customers, other than like chatbots and intelligent document processing, which might have been started 5-10 years ago and is not a GenAI topic. It’s something that can be structured and responsive. Suparna: Hey, oh, go ahead. Tom: Super—I was just going to ask a follow-up question to Liam, really, but totally okay if you can’t answer. I was just wondering if you could give an example of one of those manual tasks that hasn’t yet been… that you haven’t been able to transition to AI? Liam: Yeah, great question. I think the phrase wouldn’t be “can’t transition to AI.” I think what I’m seeing right now is, is the organization investing in doing that? So, for example, Salesforce is a great tool to track how you interact well with your customers. And so we use that to track who our customers are and how we interact with them, whether we had a meeting, like a billion other organizations do. And that could be a very agentic thing, I believe, where I have a meeting on my calendar, and let’s say a live meeting assistant takes the notes and then imports that into Salesforce, and then identifies the notes and then gives suggestions, writes emails for next steps, sends it out, sends the new meeting invite, or submits a ticket for a special request to meet with a technical advisor, like a solutions architect, about Amazon Rekognition to be able to recognize images on documents. Rekognition is an AWS AI tool, which you probably know. And so it’s not that it can’t be done; we’re just seeing a lot of these businesses that I’m working with are not implementing it at the speed at which I think a lot of leadership in the tech world think they would have by this time. Tom: Speaking of agents and how much can be automated and accelerated, I was playing around with something the other day called Jules. I’m not sure if you’ve heard of this, but this is one of these agents that is somewhat experimental, I think. It’s an experimental coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, and so on. It integrates with GitHub. This is a Google experimental agent. And I was really trying to make it work. I was like, “Oh, this looks awesome.” You give it some tasks and it just goes to work, and you come back later and it’s all done. But it was really hard to figure out what tasks to give it that it would be successful with. What I wanted it to do, basically, is first just to check all the links of something and make sure all the links were valid. And instead, it built me a link parser out of Python. You know, I was like, “Whoa, that wasn’t what I expected.” And then I thought, “Okay, let me just update the information on this page. I know that’s somewhat outdated.” And I wanted it to go out and get all the information necessary and pull it down and unpack it and update the topic. But it’s a lot harder to pull that off. I think there’s so much glue between the tasks we do. I feel like I have to set up AI so that it will be successful—give it all the info it needs, give it a very concrete task, give it access to a specific page, tell it what to do. And setting all that up, it’s hard, right? That’s all the meta-information between tasks that AI can’t really do—all that context, even prioritizing what page, where to start. So I don’t know, the agent thing is, I think, definitely the next level of AI. The ability for these tools to just update pages across a doc set in a very autonomous way is pretty amazing, but still hard to implement. Suparna, have you done anything—have you made progress with agents and getting significantly long tasks going with them? Suparna: I haven’t, no. I used to work as a software engineer, and I’m currently laid off, with some thoughts of going into something slightly different. I am volunteering in literacy right now, and the only way that I’m using AI is—I used to try to take articles, for example, from BBC Features, and try to summarize them in ESL-friendly language. And then I think I heard from one of the tech-savvy staff members, he was like, “You should be doing this with AI.” And then I finally started just feeding those articles into ChatGPT, with a slight worry about, “Is this ethical for me to do this?” But it’s actually been really great using that because the ways in which the summaries have been generated allow me to focus on interacting with the content more and thinking about how the people I’m doing the article with can engage with the content. So I’m focusing more on discussion questions, which also could be generated by the chatbot, but I think I’m enjoying the questions that I think of and that they think of more. So I guess I kind of save that pleasure for myself. And so that’s the only way I’m really using it in a context that is more of a public setting, since I’m not working right now. Tom: Yeah, well, that’s cool. That sounds like a worthwhile use. I’m just thinking back to the whole acceleration topic and how this might fit in. Let’s say you have 30 different articles that you’re trying to make more readable or more understandable. If you used an agent and you gave it the task of going through each one of these articles and applying certain style rules, it would probably do a decent job at it, and you could review it at the end. This speaks to this larger goal that many tech writers have, where you might have a whole doc set and you want to make sure that your style guide rules apply to every one of the 100 pages in the doc set, as well as other rules. And you give it this task, and then in the morning, you come back and you review the changes and you hit accept or reject. That kind of acceleration could be interesting. I haven’t achieved anything like that, but I think that is the promise. And I think many people do think that agents will be a key ingredient in the acceleration equation. But Kurzweil doesn’t really talk about agents so much, unless I missed that part. He’s very high-level. Nathan: I’m searching a PDF of the book right now, and the word “agent” only appears a few times in the body of the book and a few more times in the endnotes. So yeah, it does appear. Tom: I think at a more high level, what he says is that one innovation gives rise to another. He says we’re now using—like, before we had computers, people had to develop computers. But now computers are being used to develop more computer chips. So one invention leads to another. And I see this pretty regularly. I was thinking about just all the docs we produce or the information we produce will then accelerate the creation of other tools and APIs, which will then create more innovation. It does seem commonsensical or logical that things would accelerate because the tools we’re creating can be used to create more things more quickly. I was trying to think of an example of this. Nathan: How about in the book? Yeah, sure. Or elsewhere outside of it? Tom: Could you even say something that creates code automatically leads to greater creations? Nathan: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s a great example. The Cursor AI code editor and just the whole integration now making it faster to create additional code. Tom: Yeah, good example. All right, any other themes? Maybe we should move off of acceleration unless people have any more thoughts on that. Mette: Towards the end of the book, he was talking about the Asilomar conference and how they came up with sort of some guideline bylaws by which humanity could use AI. And I guess my thought was, are we really dependent on this one thing to keep everything in check? Otherwise, bad actors are going to intervene. There’s so much vulnerability there. When I read that part, I was like, “Okay, that sounds great.” He read some of the bylaws, and I thought, “Sounds really great.” You know, why aren’t we hearing about this more? What’s going to happen? Because if they’re not followed, there are some really bad things that can happen. Tom: I think that is a major criticism Kurzweil has received—that he’s very much a techno-utopian optimist. And especially in contrast to the last book we read with Suleyman—Suleyman devoted half of the book to containment strategies and theories. Mette: I know. Tom: And Kurzweil basically just says, “Well, the way to get past these problems is just to build better defense.” He doesn’t want to slow down the rate of development or put a bunch of regulation on it. He just wants to build better defensive mechanisms and that requires all of the man-made democratic tools that humanity has in terms of governance, which is threatened by AI, you know, according to Suleyman. So I’m like, okay, you’re placing greater weight on a foundation that is kind of crumbling. I don’t know. Yeah, it really perplexes me, the just variety of attitudes around AI. I also listened to a podcast, This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte. He’s very much embracing AI. He really wants to accelerate things. I can’t help but think, is Kurzweil really so fully embracing of AI because he wants things to move faster to achieve the whole longevity escape velocity? Like, does he want things to get in motion before he has to, you know, take his exit off this planet? Because he’s—I don’t know how old he is, but he’s been around since going to MIT in 1965. Nathan: So he’s getting up there. And I know there was a documentary on him, I don’t know, 10 or 15 years ago, that detailed some of his kind of vitamin life extension regimen, which he is on that train for sure. And he really does want to—and I can understand this—he wants to get to the next paradigm of life extension. And speaking of Father’s Day, I know he’s had a preoccupation with kind of reviving the image of his dad, who is deceased. He brings it up maybe once or twice in this book, and he definitely has elsewhere. But I feel like that really deep psychological thing that human beings have, and Ray Kurzweil in particular has, is kind of informing this techno-optimism. And, you know, I don’t know that Ray Kurzweil is looking at it from maybe just an average person’s perspective in terms of workers’ rights and environmental wellness and, you know, those sorts of things. He’s very much in his kind of ivory tower, it seems like, dreaming up these phases, kind of beyond the edge of reality. So he’s definitely an optimist. I want to be an optimist. Tom: I would love that. That sounds great. Mette: He certainly seems to be relegating all these threats to just, “Oh, details to be worked out.” Tom: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Go ahead. Liam: Yeah, just on—I totally agree with y’all. I was speaking to someone because I didn’t know who Ray Kurzweil was, and they were like, “Oh, you’re reading that book?” I was like, “Oh, is he actually a famous person?” When I was like 50 pages in, it was my perception, like, this guy’s kind of a wild writer. Like, some of these predictions are pretty nuts. Meta—and I might be pronouncing that wrong, so please… Mette: Meta. Liam: One thing that stood out to me on page 421, on the very last chapter before the 200-page appendix, which was nuts, Tom—I was very afraid you assigned a 600-page book—he says at the very end of 421, talking about being cautiously optimistic, he says at the very end, “We should thus focus work towards a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that it reflects the values of humanity as a whole.” And I like that he compared that to when we had 64,000 active nuclear warheads, and now we have 9,000. How he practiced nuclear fallout drills, and then we didn’t have a nuclear fallout, and then how maybe as a world, or the way we use nukes, is actually more reflective of our values of peace than we actually think. I’m coming up with these ideas on the fly. But just how AI could, if broadly distributed instead of just kept in the hands of the few, if it’s put in the hands of the many, it will reflect the values of humanity as a whole, is something as a concept I can definitely get behind. Tom: Yeah, that’s a great debate that has opened up, right? Do you open source and broadly distribute this technology so that everybody has access and you get maybe more checks and balances? Or does it become a tool within the hands of the elite that they keep out of bad actors’ hands, or they try to? Nathan: I have a question or kind of a thought forming on that. “We should thus work toward a world where the powers of AI are broadly distributed so that its effects reflect the values of humanity as a whole.” I think that sounds great, and I would not argue for the techno-elite to only have AI. But if we think about another technology that is broadly distributed, so let’s just say the internet. Does that reflect the values of humanity as a whole? I don’t know. Tom: Good comparison. Mette: I’m sorry, could you repeat that? It’s a good comparison. Nathan: Yeah, and I mean, maybe it’s a glass-half-empty, glass-half-full kind of conversation, but I use the internet all the time. I love it, of course. But it does seem to reflect not values or virtues, but whatever the opposite of that is, you know, some really kind of negative traits of humanity. And in a lot of ways, it’s very corrosive to democracy; it’s very corrosive to mental health. Mette: Yes. And you know, that’s really, I would think even kind of beyond a debate. So, but he doesn’t bring that up. When he does all his comparisons, he really doesn’t bring up the internet, but it’s a really good one because it was all wonderful, especially in the beginning. And I’m old, so I remember the beginning. And you know, more recently, we’ve seen the corrosive effects of the internet, particularly on really young people, children who grew up with it, and, you know, cyberbullying, all this stuff that is having a pretty great effect on society. And that’s worrying and something that he doesn’t seem to be dealing with. That’s his “details.” Tom: I agree, that’s a great analogy. I mean, if you think about the truly transformative things that have been rolled out and unleashed, as you pointed out, the internet was believed to be a democratizing force that would lead to things like the Arab Spring and awareness and just greater collaboration and knowledge sharing, breaking down the walls between countries and cultures. And yeah, and now it’s like people are realizing that that was kind of a dream and the reality is much more corrosive and toxic and polarizing and radicalizing and fragmenting. Yeah, not what people had hoped. I think that’s totally right on. Nathan: I, just in trying to be critical of my own thoughts, I do recognize that this conversation is made possible by the internet, and I think it’s very awesome. It’s very cool. And so maybe if it’s a question of optimism or pessimism, the answer is “yes,” you know? It’s both of these things, right? We can have billionaires basically censoring huge chunks of the internet to fit their kind of personal narratives, right? And we can have an Arab Spring. And, you know, maybe… I don’t know. But if AI is, you know, if we can make an analogy between AI and a broadly distributed technology like the internet, there is an optimistic world and a pessimistic world, and they’re happening at the exact same time. Mette: Or the better angels of our nature and the more evil demons of our nature are all together. Tom: He does spend a lot of time trying to make the case that technology has pretty much improved our lives, even if we don’t recognize it at the time. Go back a hundred years, and you might be surprised at the level of poverty and disease and so on. But I wanted to make a comment about the growing divide because this is also something that I’ve been thinking about. Yes, a lot of these technologies are being broadly distributed for $20 a month—which maybe that’s prohibitive, maybe it’s not. People can get access to a lot of these tools and have an immense amount of knowledge in their pocket. But we’ve also seen a tier of tools that cost $200 a month where you can get a lot more power. And what if we just turned up the dial a little bit and said, “Okay, well, for $500 a month, now you’ve really got the AI that is game-changing.” Suddenly, you’ve got a group of people who have access to game-changing AI that they then use to maybe cut their workday in half and take another job or just do three times as much. For example, I would like to take and implement one of these AI agents on my API doc course to continuously update it and make it accurate and current in every way on a continual basis. And that becomes a little asset that I can also sell if people want to download the PDF and whatever. You know, like, what if AI enabled just the automation of little side businesses like that and larger ones? You get this growing divide between, yeah, people can access AI, but they get the cheap, crappy, free version. If you really want to have an impact, you’re going to have to have some money. I don’t know. Nathan: That’s a really interesting idea. I wonder, like, why wouldn’t that happen, you know what I mean? For any company who’s monetizing AI, why wouldn’t they do that? I mean, yeah, obviously the $200 a month version, that’s for content creators, for people who have monetized their YouTube channel. It’s pretty much what you describe. And then, yeah, why wouldn’t the more luxury brands of AI kind of come out of that? And then, yeah, what about, you know, $2,000 a month? It seems like that’s the road we’re on. Tom: I mean, if you paid $2,000 a month for an AI and it did something that gave you a return on the investment of $4,000, I mean, that would be pretty impressive. I don’t really know how that would play out, right? But you know, give it a couple of years and maybe we’ll figure out how. You could sketch this out. Like, I can think of one thing I want to do. I want to create a whole course on how to use AI for tech docs, something that I keep thinking I should do, but it’s a lot of time. It’s a lot of time outside of work that I don’t really have. So, but let’s say I figure… anyway, I’m sort of getting off track. But what capabilities will evolve? And this book also made me think that there’s probably going to be a growing divide between people who can use AI to expand and augment their capabilities versus people who have rejected it. I think you mentioned, Mette, that the message among some employees is that they have to start using AI to double their productivity or find a different company. And yeah, I can see that same sentiment expanding. It’s like, you want to have the tech writers and the other workers who have figured out how to augment their capabilities five times or more. And all the people who haven’t are going to be turning to other sorts of lines of work. This growing divide. Mette: Yes, yeah, yeah. Tom: Reading these last two books really makes me feel a sense of urgency to up my skills and knowledge about AI. And even though I am experimenting and using AI heavily and I’m leading initiatives at my work, like the education initiative for tech writers and AI and so on, I still feel like there’s just so much I don’t know and I still feel behind, you know? Mette: And every week it feels like there’s something new. Tom: Yeah, yeah, people are always sharing new tools. They’re like, “Check this out, Tom.” You know, I’m like, “Oh my gosh, I, you know, this new paper, this, that.” And yeah, that pace of acceleration is really rotating fast. The wheel is going faster. And maybe I have to figure out how to leverage the AI tools to keep up. Or maybe that’s just part of the new reality, is like, there’s new stuff every day, you will never absorb it. I don’t know. Nathan: I think that that’s true. And I honestly think that that’s been true for a long time. You know, I remember being a kid and going into the bookstore and then just really being blown away by how many books there are. There’s not enough time to read. It’s a thing I struggle with. And, like I said at the beginning, you know, how many book clubs I would love to join. There is always going to be more to know and more to learn. But it has been that way for a really long time. I mean, whenever the printing press came out, right? And now, just in this realm of AI, I mean, we could have GenAI write a book for us right now, you know? And there’s some kind of… the graph of that is… I mean, there’s just so much content now, you know, more than there are hours of human existence available to consume that content. So I just want to say, I think you’re doing a great job, Tom. Tom: Well, the scenario that you’re describing is what Kurzweil is trying to say is that next epoch where biology and machine merge, and you’ll be able to process every book in the bookstore, right? This is where when our brains basically take on these computer-like capabilities through nanobots that are rearranging molecules—who knows what’s happening—but then, yeah, his argument is that you will be able to consume a library in a day or an hour or whatever, and you’ll be super intelligent. What are your thoughts on that? I mean, this feels very science-fictiony because I don’t work in biology. I haven’t seen, I’ve never experienced Neuralink. I don’t really see how we’re going to have this merger between machine and biology. But what are your thoughts on that? Mette: That was the most optimistic part of the book. You know, we don’t know a lot about the human body. We know even less about the human brain specifically. And we’re already making these predictions. I don’t know, I just think there’s a lot of surprises out there. I kind of had the same reaction as you. For that kind of certainty that Kurzweil seems to have, I don’t know. Nathan: Yeah, I mean, they haven’t been able to tame the issues of fully automated driving yet. Mette: They don’t have an air traffic control system that is running on AI. They barely have one that’s working off computer software, really. Nathan: It’s a great point. Liam: I would say, I read an article or a post, like, “There will be two people in the coming age.” How much validity this has, who knows. “One will be the builders and one will be the learners,” like those who build the software and those who learn about it. And I think that’s one of the first things that drew me to this book club. Hey, I don’t think I was built to be a builder. I’m intellectually curious and I love to read. I’m clearly not a technical writer, however, I really enjoy the gift of learning. And so I think there will be a lot of good that will come out of just people that learn and don’t build, because you’re always going to have people that need to run the ship, and so they need to run the business or make the decisions. And Meta, I agree with you about the cars. I thought his examples about Waymo from Google DeepMind and their ability to simulate 20 million miles from their actual car driving were interesting. And I liked his point at the end of the book that talks about Neuralink. I don’t understand what the back-and-forth between him and Cassandra was in the very last chapter. I don’t know who Cassandra is. But he says, “Hey, what if regulatory policy prevents us from the Neuralink happening for our neocortex for 10 years?” And that kind of feels like what’s happened a little bit for Waymo, from the tiny bit that I know of it. It probably drives a lot safer than I drive. And if regulation opens up for just allowing that, we’d probably not have 40,000 deaths a year on the roads. But regulation is such a huge part of it as well. Tom: Interesting comments about the builder versus learner. That’s a point I was thinking about in other contexts. And I think that the promise of this massive merger of machine and biology and this ability to learn at such faster, accelerated scales means that you basically will be able to perform both roles. “Builder” won’t just be the super-detailed engineer-type roles. I mean, we’ve seen this now with “vibe coding,” where if you just can describe something, the application or whatever—Gemini, whatever you’re using—will try to build it. And it’s certainly interesting. I was vibe coding something—I’m not an engineer—and I was just like, I don’t even understand what this Go code is doing, but it seems to be working for a very small, little, tiny use case. I realize that if I had more engineering knowledge, I’d be a lot more dangerous. But yeah, this idea that whatever our role is—tech writer, salesperson, whatever role you have—the tools could easily allow us to expand beyond what these roles are. If you can consume a library in a day, I mean, then you could be a rocket scientist or a surgeon or whatever. You would have that knowledge that other roles have, perhaps. So I think maybe—I mean, this is the optimistic side—but in 2029, when AGI is here, maybe tech writers won’t exist, but you can do many other roles very capably. I don’t know. Liam: The concept of… please, go ahead. I’m going to say what I thought so I don’t forget it. Just the augmentation and what that brought, and the lack of learning. Like, we need to learn less for each role. Before, you needed someone who could build shoes as a cobbler, and now you just need someone to be able to run a conveyor belt and pull the shoes down. So just the concept of augmentation, Tom. But Nathan, pass it to you, please. Nathan: Oh, I was going to ask about AGI. So, you know, that’s a really important milestone on the Law of Accelerating Returns roadmap, as is the merging of biology with nanobots. I wondered about the AGI thing because I’ve heard it said by kind of contemporary or present-day technologists like Sam Altman, he says, “By one measure, we already have AGI.” And my understanding is that AGI just means that the AI can perform basically as well as a human in any number of tasks. Is there a hard test for that? Because I feel like we could probably say that with most human tasks right now. Or the point Sam Altman was making is that the goalposts kind of keep getting shifted for AGI. Because if we were to show ChatGPT in its current state to someone from five years ago, it would completely blow their mind, right? It blew my mind two years ago when I asked it to describe a technical procedure in the style of Edgar Allan Poe, and it did it like that. Wow. And now that seems a bit quaint. But yeah, in this conversation, is there any way to kind of refine my understanding of AGI? Would anybody push back on us having AGI right now? Tom: I think the nuances that you’re bringing up are right on target. And yeah, Kurzweil doesn’t really get into AGI and define it, and it’s a subject that is highly contentious and variable depending on who’s talking. Like you said, the goalpost keeps shifting, and how do you define it? I mean, right now you could ask an AI tool pretty much anything you want, and it’s probably going to be fairly smart and capable. But what I don’t see happening is, let’s say that the AI takes over the controls at my computer, and now I want it to figure out what it should work on, evaluate the bugs in my queue, figure out which ones it should prioritize, who it should contact, whether there’s enough information to be actionable. Like, there’s a ton of contextual information that it would need to absorb to do the task of a human in that sense. That makes sense. So anyway, I don’t know, does anybody have any other thoughts on AGI? Liam? Liam: I would say the Turing test—I think I first heard of the Turing test when I watched The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch a few years ago. And then the example of AlphaGo beating the world leader in Go, and then IBM Watson beating Jeopardy, but then Watson showing the three levels of its guesses. It’s like, its first guess was “the European Union,” like “What is the Parliament?” and then it guessed “women’s suffrage” and then “African safari.” And so what I found fascinating was Ray Kurzweil’s commenting on this—and this was kind of… it comes from the Ship of Theseus, the Greek philosophy of, as I remove one plank, when does it become a new ship? And so, AGI being—Watson thinks totally different. And if we make a brain out of brain matter or silicon, it doesn’t really matter if it has consciousness. That stuff I got a little bit lost in, just the philosophical part of it. But I would say the Turing test comes back to what you said, Tom, about setting AI up. When you were talking about Jules, like setting AI up to do something that has context and can prioritize and doing that in ways that are contextual to human interactions or to everyday tasks. The reason I don’t think it’s passed the Turing test is because AGI might—I mean, AGI has to be really general. It has to be able to talk about the Renaissance and then also empathize with a child who stubs their toe, or be able to discuss with a human something irrational but really important to their mind. Because the reason economics is not an exact science is because humans are irrational. And so I think there is a bunch of stuff that wouldn’t really make sense to a robot, that wouldn’t make sense, that could pass the Turing test. So while it might be super intelligent, human-level at building code or creating APIs, it might be really hard to create a therapist AI that helps with a teenage girl or boy that is struggling with bullying or social media issues and with self-image in middle school. And so AI’s ability to—and by the way, this confused me—AI’s ability to deceive a human that it is a human, I just don’t think it’s there yet for all the niche parameters. Tom: Yeah, and it seems like a lot of the AI tools are becoming more specialized. Like, you might have a medical AI and you might have a coding AI. We already have that with things like Codex and other things. And yeah, whereas AGI is supposed to operate across domains and be able to absorb this context. I don’t know how a tool can really pull in all the context that it would need to have awareness. Like, it would have to consume my whole bug queue, all my documentation, all my Gmail, understand who’s around me, where I am organizationally, and what the releases are coming up just to even operate in a documentation role, let alone, I don’t know, build rapport with colleagues and so on. Nathan: I feel like that piece, you know, I’ve heard it suggested by some journalists that AI can synthesize different news articles, but it can’t actually go out there in the world and start talking to people. And to your point about context, I mean, that’s kind of it, right? It’s going and just kind of finding out little bits of information about who knows what or who’s on vacation and who else you have to ask. You know, those kinds of details escape AI right now. But even if it was able to say, “Hey Tom, I need to find out X. Where do I go to find that?” That would, I guess, be a start. But yeah, right now it’s like an artificial general sophist or something like that, you know, almost pretending that it’s smart. Tom: Well, hey, before we wrap this up, I wanted to promote the next book just to put it on your radar. So this next book is— Nathan: Perfect. Wait, what, I missed that. Tom: Oh, the next book. I bought it because I was worried I wasn’t going to have enough time. Nathan: Oh, you held it up. Got it. Okay. Tom: Yeah, so we’ve got Supremacy: AI, ChatGPT, and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson. I thought this might be interesting because there does seem to be a tangible sense of the race toward AGI, to build it first. I mean, I’ve heard this in many different contexts where people really want to have their workers double down and move towards this. And I thought it might be interesting to see what this book is about. So I haven’t read it, but it does seem to get decent reviews. Nathan: It did get an Editor’s Pick, whatever that—I don’t know how that’s decided. Financial Times Business Book of the Year 2024. Tom: So it can’t be that bad with 739 reviews. Nathan: Was it decided by AI? Was it a pick by AI? Tom: I don’t know. We’ll find out. But usually when books have hundreds of reviews, they’re going to be substantial. And even this book that we read, despite its flaws, it was thought-provoking and interesting. And gosh, it gave me a lot to think about, and for that, I thought it was worthwhile. But thank you so much for coming to this. I appreciate it. This is kind of nice to have a smaller group today. You’re able to get to know each other a little more, and you all are very sharp and insightful. So I appreciate your comments and thoughts. Nathan: Yeah, thank you. It’s been great. Appreciate it. Liam: These are really fun. Suparna: Thanks, everyone. This is great. Tom: Thank you. Have a good rest of your weekend, and I’ll see you next month. All: Bye-bye.

Title: The Tech Job Meltdown

He wrote me a prescription; he said “You are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease”Industrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn’t the impact of COVID, this isn’t a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn’t (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like “it was overhiring during the pandemic” or “it’s a wave of H1B workers” or “all knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs” are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there’s a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of “qualified research and development spending” in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments… if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted “off the top” of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you’ve lived through unless you’re quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research… which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I’m about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I’m always doing that and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. But it’s not as broadly useful, and it’s not a simple recategorization, or we’d all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let’s assume they can’t reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically “tax credits”. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you’ll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little… unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the “real world” of companies focused on building tomorrow’s products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which … were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized “hey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!” And this new tax ruling doesn’t precisely say “we don’t want to do that” but it does say “we don’t want you to be quick about it” - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss “on paper” for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost… therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to “mandatory amortization”, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods… that’s one of them, as I’m sure you’ve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative “scoring”. The delay wasn’t legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - “grades” legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the “official” forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to “cheese the system” or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a “shock” when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced “extinction-level” tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they’re based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn’t anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don’t want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their “Year of Efficiency” in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don’t think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the “Magnificent Seven” are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That’s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms… heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads… built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I’ll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn’t write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn’t this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn’t going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was “cut expenses” and that mostly became “slow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees” so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what’s currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean “investing in R&D” and more generally “investing in software” for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the “tech sector”. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there’s a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we’re actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening “to defeat the Wealth Effect” and cool down speculative fervor … yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?
