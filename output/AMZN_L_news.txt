Microsoft has denied recent reports claiming that it imposed a strict 30% profit margin on its Xbox gaming division. The company said it aims high, but didn’t provide an exact profit margin figure. Microsoft pushed back against the claims in a new CNBC interview, where the company discussed the challenges and rumors that arose over the past year, including numerous layoffs and project cancellations. Previously, a Bloomberg story in October reported that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has set a 30% profit goal as part of “accountability margins,” with Xbox in particular feeling the pressure. Many industry insiders whispered similar information, which was acknowledged as the primary driver of Microsoft’s cost-cutting measures, including scrapping various projects and reducing headcount. The 30% figure stood out because it’s well above typical profit margins in the gaming industry, which are reported to range from 17% to 22%. Xbox’s own margins were 12% in 2022, according to earlier documentation. Microsoft spoke to CNBC directly and said, “While the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.” Xbox’s hurdles have been piling up, with over 9,000 employees affected across multiple rounds of layoffs. Numerous big-budget projects were axed in the wake of Microsoft’s layoffs, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark Reboot, Rare’s long-in-development Everwild, and ZeniMax Online’s sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird. Furthermore, Xbox sales have taken a nosedive, with a whopping 70% drop in November, putting the company far behind Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo’s Switch 2 in hardware sales. Xbox also announced last week that it wouldn’t be implementing the Xbox Wrapped feature this year due to budget constraints. Reports claim that Xbox is shifting funds toward its 25th anniversary celebration in 2026. However, it still shows that the company is under financial pressure. Despite all these challenges and setbacks, Microsoft is still pursuing and pivoting towards cloud gaming and cross-platform gaming, Xbox Game Pass subscription, and is forgoing exclusivity to allow more players to join Xbox’s gaming endeavors, ranging from PCs, handhelds like the Rog Ally and Ally X, mobile devices, and even automobiles. As for Bloomberg, it’s not yet clear if the news outlet will retract its statement, update its report, or provide further information regarding the matter. Buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on Amazon CNBC

In business, the power of individual leaders is an inherently hard thing to measure. It’s subjective, and it fluctuates on any given day, just like the strength of an electrical current goes up and down depending on environmental conditions. To commemorate Variety’s 120th anniversary year, we gave ourselves a tough assignment. We wanted to take a snapshot of leadership and muscle in the entertainment industry at this fraught moment of turmoil and transition for Hollywood. After months of internal debate, months of arguing over draft lists and a last push of double-checking titles and name spellings, here we finally arrive at the end result: The Variety 120 list of the most powerful executives in entertainment. Notice the emphasis on executives. We realized early on that we needed strict guidelines for who to include and who not to include. The Variety 120 is a survey of executive leadership at the industry’s biggest and most influential companies. That includes some companies that are far removed from Hollywood geographically but still have influence in the global business of entertainment, which we define here as film, TV, music and gaming. We intentionally did not include actors, writers, directors, producers, multihyphenates, lawyers, talent agents or managers, simply to make the ranking process more manageable. We also kept our lens focused on traditional entertainment, thus this list does not include leaders from sports or news. When you get down to it, 120 isn’t that many slots to cover a truly global business. So we lean toward the C-suite – the senior managers who are responsible for driving their companies forward and delivering the bottom line. Also, notice the emphasis on big. This list leans toward the biggest studios, labels, streamers and game publishers who dominate mass media production and distribution. We considered a company’s market share and market cap in determining this ranking. A person’s career achievements and overall industry stature were also a factor for inclusion. We also considered things that can’t be tallied with a calculator. In many of the entries, you’ll read our assessment that the individual has strong ties or deep connections to the creative community, or the investment community, or that he or she commands great respect among colleagues. It’s a relationship business, after all. Executive careers rise and fall on the strength of reputations. All kidding aside, it really is like high school with money and stock options. Variety journalists write every day (every hour) about how dramatically our industry is being transformed by the streaming revolution, by the growth of the global demand for content and by the rise of digital-native creators who would scoff “TLDR” at the idea of getting notes from a creative executive. But in reality, if you want to break a new artist, launch a TV show, open a movie or orchestrate a blockbuster video game release – most roads to achieving a bona fide hit still run through the companies and the leaders highlighted here. Listen to “Daily Variety” podcast: Showbiz news and analysis tailored for industry insiders. Spoiler alert: Our selection for the last slot on this list, No. 120, was carefully considered. The person is the leader of Indonesia’s largest media conglomerate. Indonesia is one of the world’s fast-rising entertainment hubs. We noticed that from our internet traffic and by the growing number of markets and festivals that we cover in the region. We made this choice to bookend the list with a signpost of the future and an example of the reach and influence of movies, TV, music and games. From our very first issue, published Dec. 16, 1905, much of Variety’s focus has been on the people who work behind the scenes to make things happen for those who take the stage. We hope this list can be a scorecard for readers who, like the staff of Variety, are eager to see what comes next for our fascinating industry in 2026 and beyond. Profiles written by Jem Aswad, Matt Donnelly, Steven J. Horowitz, Angelique Jackson, Elsa Keslassy, Brent Lang, Cynthia Littleton, Jennifer Maas, Naman Ramachandran, Rebecca Rubin, Michael Schneider, Todd Spangler, Brian Steinberg and Nick Vivarelli. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Sarandos got his start in the entertainment biz working at a video-rental store as a teen. He’s now one of the most powerful content executives in Hollywood, rubbing elbows with celebs, showrunners, directors and other creatives who make content (or want to) for Netflix’s 300 million-plus subscribers worldwide. He’s overseen all content operations at the company since 2000, when it was still a DVD-by-mail outfit, and has had his hand on the steering wheel throughout its monumental rise. Sarandos led Netflix’s move into original content starting with the 2013 launch of “House of Cards.” He has famously called the moviegoing experience “outdated,” irking not just theater owners but filmmakers. In a reflection of Netflix’s clout, Sarandos has made a serious bid to acquire the Warner Bros. studios and HBO Max. Even if Netflix doesn’t win, Sarandos is showing that the company is definitely playing in the big leagues. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The more that Comcast pushes onto Langley’s plate, the more she rises to the challenge. As NBCUniversal and other top traditional media companies focus on the power of big events to draw large audiences, Langley must translate her success with content franchises into devising spectacles that bring people to screens all at the same time. Look for NBCU to celebrate more anniversaries like the 50th anniversary of “Saturday Night Live” and NBC’s centennial in the months to come. She must also help stock the pipeline with new content favorites that draw viewers to the Peacock streaming service as well as traditional TV. After a sweeping reorganization of NBCUniversal in 2024, Langley controls greenlights across the entire enterprise, overseeing programming, marketing, distribution, acquisitions and operations for the film and TV studios, the linear network, Peacock and Bravo. Her trademark poise served her well through the M&A noise of 2025, delivering consistent support for creatives. Langley’s beloved film studio Universal Pictures, her training ground, look to blow the doors off of 2026 with releases from Christopher Nolan and Steven Spielberg, as well as animated sequels in the “Minions” and “Super Mario Bros.” franchises. Title: Chairman and CEO, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ellison has a network of influential friends and family, starting with his ultra-wealthy dad, Oracle mogul Larry Ellison. After a career as a film producer with hits that included Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” Ellison donned the mantle of media mogul. He led Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, bankrolled by his father and RedBird Capital Partners — a deal that met with the approval of Donald Trump and his administration. After installing a mostly new management team, Ellison’s early moves at the new Paramount Skydance have included inking a rich deal for UFC rights and the acquisition of Bari Weiss’s The Free Press (with Weiss installed as editor-in-chief of CBS News). Ellison is now looking consolidate more power in Hollywood: He’s in the thick of a public brawl with Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety, pitting him against Netflix. The sale process is turning in to a referendum on the future of Hollywood. Title: CEO, YouTube Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Mohan is a Silicon Valley exec with a chill vibe — who runs a media business estimated to rival Disney by revenue, as YouTube reinforces its pole position as the most-streamed service on TVs in the U.S. That stunning stat surely helped YouTube land the TV rights deal that shocked Hollywood: The annual Oscars kudocast will move to YouTube starting in 2029 with the 101st Academy Awards ceremony. It’s been a busy few years on the job for Mohan, who assumed the chief exec role in 2023 after serving as YouTube’s chief product officer. He joined Google with its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007. In addition to overseeing YouTube’s significant core ads business, Mohan has been driving growth of the platform’s subscriptions businesses, including YouTube TV. With more than 10 million pay-TV subscribers, YouTube was in a position to flex its market power in programming renewals in 2025 — and its tough negotiating tactics led to blackouts of Disney and Univision nets before the parties reached deals. Mohan is now setting YouTube’s AI agenda, balancing concerns of Hollywood players with the rollout of powerful new content tools for its millions of creators. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: One of the most powerful and well-regarded execs in TV, Walden leads Disney’s portfolio of entertainment media, news and content businesses worldwide, and has shared oversight of Disney+ and Hulu with Alan Bergman. Under her leadership, ABC has been the No. 1 entertainment network for four straight seasons and ABC News has topped its rivals — impressive achievements even as linear TV continues to decline. Over the years, Walden has had indisputable success in television, overseeing such hits as “24,” “Glee,” “Modern Family,” “Homeland,” “This Is Us” and more recently, “Abbott Elementary,” “High Potential,” “Paradise,” “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Kardashians” and more. Before joining Disney, she rose through the ranks at the Fox studio and network. Now she’s on the short list to succeed Bob Iger at the helm of Disney next year. This fall, Walden faced a test with ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel amid a right-wing backlash over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s murder. After a PR storm, she brought Kimmel back and got two big affiliate groups to resume airing his show. She was also in the thick of Disney’s two-week battle with YouTube in November over a carriage agreement. Title: CEO, Disney Held job since: 2022 (was CEO from 2005-20) Sources of power: Iger is on his second farewell tour as leader of the Magic Kingdom, with the 74-year-old executive’s contract expiring in December 2026 — and Disney’s board poised to name a successor early next year. But even as a lame-duck CEO, Iger remains a powerful force in media and entertainment. Following Iger’s return as chief exec in late 2022 in the wake of Disney’s first try at finding an Iger successor did not take. Since his return, Iger has reinvigorated Disney’s movie studios and overseen the theme park and cruise biz’s recovery from the COVID crash. Iger has moved to combine Disney+ and Hulu (after closing the buyout of Comcast’s Hulu stake) into a supercharged unified streamer while finally launching a streaming-only version of ESPN. The stock hasn’t recovered from its streaming-bubble highs, but Iger has proven a deft manager of the global entertainment conglomerate’s many moving pieces. Even as he says goodbye — after postponing his retirement five times! — Iger will have a part in the selection of the next CEO. Title: Chairman and CEO, Comcast Corp. Held job since: Chairman, 2004; CEO, 2002 Sources of power: An unassuming media executive in an industry filled with CEOs willing to pitch, promote and propagandize, Roberts presides over one of the largest distributorships of video in the nation, as well as the NBCUniversal entertainment empire. He has quietly worked to keep the company current by investing in sports rights as well as overseas assets like Sky. Roberts must now steer the company around new hurdles, including cord cutting and the rise of streaming video. Because nothing stays the same in pay TV for long. With the planned Versant Media spinoff expected to be completed early next year, Comcast will soon part with the basic cable networks that were so central to its purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric back in 2011. Title: Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Group Held job since: 2010 Sources of power: Grainge joined Universal in 1986 at leader of its Polydor publishing division and rose through the ranks during periods of galvanizing change in the industry, assuming the helm in 2010 just as streaming was beginning to take hold. In the years since he has presided over UMG’s expansion into the world’s largest music company — with artists ranging from the Beatles and Taylor Swift to the Weeknd and “KPop Demon Hunters” — its public listing in 2021, the expansion of its publishing and merchandise divisions, and the rise and plateau of streaming growth. Most recently, UMG has taken a leadership position in steering the industry through the challenges of AI (striking deals with and/or lawsuits against major AI companies — or both, as with Suno) and its next areas of growth, including initiatives to increasingly monetize “superfans.” There are certainly challenges: UMG’s $775 million acquisition of the artist-services company Downtown is under fierce scrutiny from the EU, and it was actually sued for defamation by Drake, one of its biggest artists, in bizarre collateral damage from that artist’s feud with fellow UMG artist Kendrick Lamar. But in the third quarter of 2025, Universal held nearly 36% U.S. market share — and that was before the release of Taylor Swift’s “Life of a Showgirl,” which sold a record-breaking 2.7 million copies on its first day. Title: CEO, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: David Zaslav has been on a hire-wire act of debt, restructuring and outrunning the marketplace to prove the merger thesis that brought WarnerMedia and Discovery together in April 2022. But time ran out. David Ellison’s aggressive overtures forced his hand to initiate a sale process for all or part of the Warner Bros. Discovery (depending on who’s buying). For the foreseeable future, Zaslav still holds the keys in Burbank and Hudson Yards – and he’s demonstrating that in rebuffing Paramount’s offers more than half a dozen times in favor of Netflix’s $83 billion offer. Leading WBD for the past three years has been Zaslav’s highest profile job in Hollywood – and he’s become a lightning rod in the creative community at a time of disruption. Zaslav got his start in the go-go early days of cable in the 1980s with a long tenure at NBC where he helped launch CNBC and MSNBC. He gained prominence as a CEO – and for his huge paychecks — after he took the reins of Discovery Communications in late 2006. Title: Senior VP of Services, Apple Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: Cue is the ultimate Apple insider. He has long steered its expansion on the software and services side of the ledger for the company that has transformed the world with its hardware. He also clearly has the trust of CEO Tim Cook to set the agenda for Apple in Hollywood. Cue has embraced a build-not-buy strategy as Apple has revved up the Apple TV content business with big-budget series, sports rights, documentaries and children’s programs. The success of Apple’s first mega-budget film production, “F1: The Movie,” reflected well on Cue’s steady-hand stewardship. And his ambition was on display when he told Variety during a cover story interview that he really wanted “F1” to reach moviegoers in a profound way. “I hope that when most people go see the movie, they walk out wanting to be a race car driver,” he told Variety in April 2025. Title: Chief Content Officer, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Nearly three years into her gig as chief content officer at Netflix and with almost a decade at the streamer under her belt, Bajaria oversees some of the biggest and boldest TV shows of our time, including “Stranger Things,” “Squid Game,” “Wednesday,” “Bridgerton,” “Heeramandi” and “Lupin,” and Oscar-winning films like “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.” And her power in Hollywood is poised to get even bigger if Netflix succeeds in taking over Warner Bros. Discovery. For now, Bajaria’s focus is on continuing to grow Netflix’s local-programming offerings throughout the globe and pushing the streamer further into live events and sports. Before joining Netflix, Bela was president of Universal Television. Title: Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Bergman is the well-respected leader in charge of the Mouse House’s film studios, which feed into both theatrical and streaming pipelines. He’s managing not just release windows and production budgets, but also egos. On his watch, Disney has produced several billion-dollar-plus hits, including “Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Moana 2” and the live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” with “Zootopia 2” on track to be another big winner. A nearly three-decade company veteran, he became chairman of Walt Disney Studios in 2021. He was elevated to his current role in 2023, in which capacity he has shared oversight (alongside Dana Walden) of Disney’s direct-to-consumer, technology and ad sales groups, as well as international content and operations. Title: Head of Amazon MGM Studios and Amazon Prime Video Held job since: 2020 Sources of power: Mike Hopkins shepherded some big changes at Amazon’s on-screen entertainment division this year with the exits of both Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders from the studio business, and the entrance of longtime Netflix TV exec Peter Friedlander. Building on his background in distribution and sales from his time as CEO at Hulu and president of Fox networks, Hopkins continues to push Amazon into TV ad sales through its Amazon Ads infrastructure to growing success. Under Hopkins, Prime Video currently offers more than 100 add-on subscription options in the U.S., including Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max, Paramount+, Sony’s Crunchyroll and Amazon-owned MGM+. Amazon’s reach has made the channels offering a big driver of subscription for these media partners. Title: President and CEO, Live Nation Held job since: 2005 Sources of power: A master of vertical integration, Rapino has kept Live Nation and Ticketmaster to one record-breaking year after another even as the post-pandemic boom in concertgoing has leveled off. So far in 2025, Live Nation is on pace to have its biggest year yet, with overall revenue for the first nine months hitting $18.89 billion, up eight percent compared to last year’s $17.5 billion. Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to the demand for live entertainment in international markets, where fan count is projected to surpass the United States for the first time. Chalk that up to major tours that saw artists like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé traipsing the globe, yet it’s also the company’s ongoing ventures into management, venue ownership and other related areas of the business. Title: Chairman and CEO, HBO and Max Content Held job since: August 2020 Sources of power: Casey Bloys likes awards, and for good reason: HBO/HBO Max gets a lot of them. In 2025, the combined outlets landed 30 Emmys — tying Netflix for the most — thanks to the strength of series like “The Pitt” (outstanding drama series), “The Penguin,” “Hacks,” “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and more. His current roster also includes smashes like “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us” and “Euphoria” — which recently gave him four current original series with cross-platform audiences averaging more than 15 million viewers per episode – a first for the pay cabler. Other titles that have driven the TV conversation under his watch have included “Succession,” “Barry,” “The Rehearsal,” the “True Detective” franchise, “And Just Like That” and “Peacemaker”; and earlier, “Veep,” “Girls,” “Silicon Valley,” “Watchmen,” “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies” and “Chernobyl.” Bloys first took over HBO series, late night and specials as president in February 2016; he joined the network in 2004 as director of development at HBO Independent Productions. Title: Chairman, FX Networks Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: An astute observer of the TV landscape and respected creative leader, Landgraf has made boundary-pushing television a hallmark of FX ever since he joined in 2004. Under Landgraf, FX has produced solid ratings and acclaim with bold (some might say risky) bets such as “Shōgun” — winner of 18 Emmy awards, a one-year record for a single series — as well as series like “The Bear,” “Fargo,” “Alien: Earth,” long-running fan-favorite “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and Ryan Murphy’s “American Horror Story” franchise. After Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Landgraf aligned with the Mouse House’s streaming strategy to make Hulu the primary streaming outlet for FX, which has let him continue to take big swings on standout content. Title: Co-CEO, Netflix Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Peters may not have the name recognition of his co-CEO partner Ted Sarandos, but the duo are on equal footing in running the streaming giant. Peters, who joined Netflix in 2008, was previously chief product officer and spent several years as general manager of Netflix Japan. While Sarandos handles the content side, Peters focuses on technology, product development, pricing and partnerships. His purview also includes the still-nascent games initiative and the growing ad-supported business. Peters knows the Netflix culture inside and out, and he’s credited with building the company’s talent organization and recently overseeing a revision to its famed “Culture Memo.” Peters will be an integral part of any integration of Warner Bros. and HBO into Netflix, should the acquisition agreement come to pass. Title: President, Marvel Studios; Chief Creative Officer, Marvel Held job since: 2010 / 2019 Sources of power: After a stretch of ho-hum box office performers in recent years, Marvel Studios aims to reclaim its status as the premiere superhero studio in 2026 with “Avengers: Doomsday.” The blockbuster-to-be features the return of “Endgame” directors Anthony and Joe Russo, the revival of Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, and recasting Robert Downey Jr. as the villainous Doctor Doom, plus finally introducing the X-Men into the MCU. In a rare interview with reporters over the summer, Feige declared that well-documented problems Marvel’s been facing stem from an overabundance of supply, not a sudden drop in demand. As such, Marvel’s output for 2026 will be drastically decreased, with just three movies launching in theaters: “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” the studio’s co-production with Sony Pictures; a special re-release of “Avengers: Endgame” and “Doomsday.” Title: President and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Ravi Ahuja was one half of the most orderly transition atop a Hollywood studio in recent memory. He took the CEO reins from Tony Vinciquerra last January, but the plan was set in motion when Ahuja was recruited to Sony to head TV operations, after a he had a brief run as president of business operations and chief financial officer of Walt Disney Television. Ahuja’s first big test at Sony was steering the “Jeopardy” host transition, which took two tries to get right, but America’s favorite quiz show endured. Now he’s got a long runway to lead the studio into its second century (Columbia Pictures marked its centennial in 2024) and its endowed with a library of more than 3,500 films and more than 35,000 episodes in an IP-hungry marketplace. Title: President, Paramount Skydance Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: • He’s the key operating executive overseeing the newly merged Paramount Skydance.• He’s a media veteran after climbing the ranks at NBCUniversal, Comcast and Fox. Shell has rebounded at the enlarged Paramount Skydance after exiting NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to having had an inappropriate relationship with an NBCUniversal employee. He’s now back in new role as David Ellison’s right-hand man given his depth of experience. At Paramount Skydance, he’s overseeing day-to-day operations, a task that has included a wave of mass layoffs conducted three months after the Paramount Global takeover closed. Shell isn’t just trying to slash costs: He and Ellison envision a new path forward for Paramount’s TV business, hoping to reinvent brands like CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central for a streaming-centric world, while pumping more content into Paramount+. If his boss is successful in landing Warner Bros. Discovery, Shell will have an even bigger collection of media businesses under his oversight. Title: Executive Chairman and CEO of Fox Corp., Chairman of News Corp. Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Under Murdoch’s aegis, Fox Corp. proven surprisingly robust and resilient. After the company sold off much of its studio and cable assets to Disney in 2019, conventional wisdom held that Fox would be a small but feisty element in the media ecosystem, but the company’s focus on news, sports and other types of must-watch-as-it-happens content has boosted viewership and revenue. There are challenges ahead, especially as the NFL moves closer to renegotiating its current media contracts, but Fox has thrived by taking measured steps into streaming and bigger steps to lock in live viewership. Title: President and CEO, Sony Group Corporation Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Hiroki Totoki took over as Sony’s CEO in April 2025 as the company’s center of gravity shifted decisively toward entertainment. In the run-up to the transition, he was closely involved in steering Sony’s entertainment businesses toward greater IP coordination across Pictures, Music and PlayStation, reinforcing a strategy built on franchises that can move across formats and markets. That approach aligns with Sony’s long-standing focus on Kando — emotional impact delivered at scale — and has shown up in properties ranging from anime juggernaut “Demon Slayer” to cross-media adaptations like “The Last of Us.” Totoki also took direct oversight of Sony Interactive Entertainment during a leadership transition, underlining his role as the executive trusted with execution when the stakes are high. As CEO, he now controls a company where games, music, film and anime drive strategy — alongside the hardware that carries them. Title: Co-Chair and CEO, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca proved naysayers wrong this year after a rough 2024 and early 2025. They turned things around the old-fashioned way – by banking on bold directors and new ideas during a time where reboots and sequels have reigned supreme. Movies of all shapes and sizes, from Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners,” Zach Cregger’s “Weapons” and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” scored with audiences. It’s an ethos that De Luca has embraced throughout his career, which took off when he was named production chief at New Line Cinema at the age of 27. He championed films such as “Seven,” “Boogie Nights,” “Friday” and helped to launch the careers of David Fincher and Anderson. The pair headed MGM prior to its sale to Amazon, which was around the time that Warner Bros. was in the market for new film leadership. Abdy and De Luca got to work quickly and took big swings while brokering deals with directors and stars like Ryan Coogler, Emerald Fennell, Zach Cregger and Tom Cruise. The 2025 slate backs up the pair’s promise to use WB’s considerable resources to make the studio an attractive place to work for “filmmakers with singular visions,” as they wrote in a memo to staff in October after renewing their contracts. Title: Chairman and CEO, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Rothman is the definition of a certain kind of hard-driving studio executive of yore but this year he proved he can innovate with original concepts and service big IP at the same time. He bet on Keke Palmer, SZA and Issa Rae with the commercial and critical hit “One of Them Days,” relaunched Danny Boyle’s “28 Days Later” franchise with a sequel to follow immediately in ’26 and captured the zeitgeist with “KPop Demon Hunters” (though that film released via Sony’s pay-one partner Netflix). As always with Rothman, the man guaranteed to deliver an expletive-laden sound bite at CinemaCon, it’s about next year’s slate. 2026 will bring “Spider-Man: Brand New Day,” and the innovative four-part biopic release “The Beatles” from filmmaker Sam Mendes. Title: Chairman, Netflix Film Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: After building a reputation on spinning popular film franchises out of existing IP (“The Lego Movie” franchise, Stephen King’s “It” and “Sherlock Holmes”), in 2024, film producer Dan Lin pivoted from film producer to studio head by taking on the top film job at Netflix. Just two years prior, Lin had been in negotiations to become head of DC Studios but decided to stick to his own shingle, Rideback, but the Netflix offer proved to be the right kind of challenge. Since joining the streamer, Lin has enforced a strategy of making one major tentpole film each quarter — upcoming offerings include “The Rip,” from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; “Apex” with Charlize Theron; and “Here Comes the Flood,” with Denzel Washingont, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Robert Pattionson. Among Lin’s biggest wins so far was overseeing the final cut of “K-Pop Demon Hunters,” which has become Netflix’s biggest film ever and greenlighting an ambitious slate of films, including Greta Gerwig’s “Narnia,” which will also play an exclusive engagement at Imax theaters worldwide. Titles: Co-Head, Worldwide Video, Apple Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Erlicht and Van Amburg long ago learned how to expand their effectiveness through an air-tight partnership. They worked together for 15 years as programming executives at Sony Pictures Television and its predecessors before being recruited in 2017 by Apple services boss Eddy Cue to drive the company’s leap into original content production and commissioning what was born in November 2019 as Apple TV+ (in October, they nixed the + sign with a rebrand as Apple TV). The two have built the operation in the fishbowl of being a high-profile startup effort within a corporate giant of immense influence and a $4 trillion market cap. Erlicht and Van Amburg have endured waves of rumored shakeups and scrutiny of their creative strategies. This summer “F1: The Movie” was the kind of popcorn vehicle at the global box office that made the parent company proud. It also dovetailed nicely with Apple TV’s five-year deal unveiled in October that will bring F1 racing rights to its platform in the U.S. starting in 2026. Title: Co-Chair, Paramount Pictures and Chair, Paramount Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Dana Goldberg has a bigger picture to look at these days now that her longtime home Skydance is also home to all of Paramount’s IP. Partnered with Josh Greenstein on the film front and flying solo at the top of TV, Goldberg is plotting out long-term strategy for both divisions under David Ellison’s new regime. As of this year, Goldberg now oversees production, marketing, distribution and strategic planning, and has added Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Films and Paramount Television Studios to her purview. Goldberg joined Skydance in 2010 as president of production and helped found Skydance Television in 2013. Most recently, Goldberg was chief creative officer of Skydance overseeing several entries in the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise, as well as hit series like “Reacher” and “Jack Ryan.” Before joining Skydance, Goldberg was head of production at Village Roadshow Pictures. Title: Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of Platforms, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: This year, Josh Greenstein left Sony Pictures after a decade to head up the film division at the newly merged Skydance-Paramount alongside Dana Goldberg, and advise on Paramount’s new cross-platform strategy across film and TV. For the previous 10 years, Greenstein was at the top of Sony’s Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films, AFFIRM Films, and Sony Pictures Animation, overseeing films including the “Spider-Man” and “Spiderverse” franchises, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “James Bond” and Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women.” During Greenstein’s tenure, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” became Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time, earning $1.91 billion worldwide at the box office and “Into the Spider-Verse” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Prior to joining Sony, he was head of marketing at Paramount Pictures, overseeing franchises including “Transformers,” “Star Trek,” “Jackass” and “Scary Movie.” Title: Co-chairman and CEO, DC Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: James Gunn and Peter Safran, the new guardians of DC Studios, were hired to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for the Warner Bros.-owned comic book empire. Gunn, the operation’s creative mind, took those efforts into his own hands with last summer’s hit “Superman,” which had epic responsibility of relaunching DC Universe. (The studio’s last iteration of superhero movies imploded with the unfortunate losing-streak of “The Flash,” “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” “Shazam: Fury of the Gods” and “Blue Beetle.”) Gunn will return to the director’s chair for what he describes as the “next installment in the Super-Family,” but he’s passed off the reins for “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” two spinoffs set in 2026 that’ll be a bigger test of DC’s popularity. Both focus on comic book characters that don’t enjoy the benefit of being household names. Safran, a business-minded executive and a former talent manager with Brillstein-Grey, has proven a flair for knowing the projects that’ll speak to audiences. He’s a lead producer on the “Conjuring” universe, which is the highest-grossing horror franchise with more than $2 billion across nine films. Title: CEO, Lionsgate Held job since: 2000 Sources of power: Lionsgate was a much smaller operation when Feltheimer took over the the turn of the 2000s after nine years at Sony’s Columbia TriStar TV Group. The Canadian-born studio emerged as a global contender on Feltheimer’s watch with hits such as the “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games” film series. The studio rode the pre-Peak TV wave of scripted expansion with such distinctive hits as “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and more recently “Ghosts,” “Yellowjackets” and “The Studio.” But like every other studio, Lionsgate’s traditional profit engines are under new pressures that will challenge the leadership of a long-serving CEO. Title: CEO, Sony Music Entertainment/Chairman, Sony Music Group Held job since: 2017/2019 Sources of power: Stringer has spent his tenure at Sony Music building out the various arms of the operation, from buying indie companies AWAL and Orchard to acquiring catalogs from Queen and Pink Floyd, for a reported $1.27 billion and $400 million, respectively. This year, Sony Music Entertainment saw significant boosts across the board as records including Tyler, the Creator’s “Don’t Tap the Glass” and Bad Bunny’s “DeBÍ TiRAR Más FOToS” became global hits, boosting total profit from recorded music and publishing to $2.89 billion in Q3 — up 13.3 percent year over year. Over the first three quarters of 2025, SME earned a 26.65 percent market share, per Billboard — ahead of Warner Music Group and indies, and only second to Universal Music Group. And in an industry where AI has become a hotbed for controversy, Stringer has helped broker a landmark deal with Spotify to develop AI tools intended to aid artists. Title: Chairman, Television Studios, NBC Entertainment and Peacock Scripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Pearlena Igbokwe has arguably one of the most compelling stories of any TV executive out there: Having emigrated from Nigeria at age 6, Igbokwe was raised on some the greatest U.S. shows of the 1970s and 1980s. That inspired her to pursue a job in TV, which led her to early positions at NBC and HBO, before starting a 20-year tenure at Showtime, where she developed “Dexter,” “Nurse Jackie” and “Masters of Sex,” among other shows. In 2012, she returned to NBC, and quickly saw her star rise as she worked in drama on series such as “The Blacklist” and “This Is Us.” Moving to Universal TV as president, she expanded the Dick Wolf empire (which now includes the “Law & Order,” “Chicago” and “FBI” franchises) and built a thriving business as a supplier to outlets like Netflix and HBO. Taking over Universal Studio Group in 2020, Igbokwe now oversees teams that handle staples like NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “America’s Got Talent” as well as HBO Max’s “Hacks,” Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside” and all those Wolf shows. And the talent in her company’s purview include Mike Schur, Tina Fey, Jordan Peele, Darren Star, Nahnatchka Khan, Seth MacFarlane, Julie Plec, Amy Poehler, Lorne Michaels and others. Title: Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Television Group and US Networks Held job since: 2021 / 2025 Sources of power: Channing Dungey has made history several times in her career, including as the first Black executive to lead a major broadcast network, and the first woman and first Black executive to run Warner Bros. TV Group. Her oversight include Warner Bros. TV, Warner Bros. Unscripted TV (including Warner Horizon, Shed Media and Telepictures) and animated producers Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe. On her watch, Warner Bros. TV Group has enjoyed a string of recent successes in network, cable, streaming and syndication including “The Pitt,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Ted Lasso,” “The Bachelor” franchise, “The Penguin,” “Shrinking,” “The Voice,” “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage,” “Running Point,” “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” “You” and more. Before Warner Bros. and Discovery plan their split — which would move the U.S. networks to a separate company — Dungey has also spent part of the past year evolving the conglom’s linear TV business with channels like Discovery, HGTV, Food, Cartoon Network, TLC, Adult Swim, TBS, TNT, TCM and others. Dungey is a well-liked, celebrated exec who at ABC Entertainment built hits like “The Good Doctor” and the return of “American Idol,” and also made a swift change to “Roseanne” when its star made offensive remarks on social media. She also developed signature shows like “Scandal” and “Once Upon a Time” and helped keep long-running series like “Grey’s Anatomy” as juggernauts. She was also named one of Variety’s Power of Women honorees in 2021. Title: President of Direct-to-Consumer, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Joe Earley has the marketing sensibilities required to oversee the operations and growth strategies for two of the most important assets of the future for Disney – streamers Disney+ and Hulu. His experience as a producer with Gail Berman at Jackal Group after he left Fox will also serve him well in a job that requires juggling a broad portfolio – from Hulu’s edgy limited series to Disney-branded shows for Disney+. Title: Chair of Direct to Consumer, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: While now a key member of David Ellison’s leadership team at the Skydance-owned Paramount, Cindy Holland is still best known for setting Netflix up to be the powerhouse TV industry player it is today. Holland spent a total of 18 years with the streamer, nine of which she served as head of original content, where she established the programming strategy with early streaming hits including “House of Cards,” “Orange is the New Black” and “Stranger Things.” Earlier this year, Holland stepped away from her role as CEO at indie studio Sister to join Ellison’s exec ranks as the lieutenant in charge of revamping Paramount’s streaming offering as the company enters its new era. Title: CEO, Illumination Entertainment Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Chris Meledandri founded Illumination in 2007 after a stint running animation at Fox. He quickly established the company, which was backed by Universal, as one of the most successful producers of family fare in Hollywood. It all kicked off with 2010’s “Despicable Me,” the story of a reformed supervillain named Gru that has spawned four films and three spinoffs featuring the Minions. But Illumination didn’t stop there, producing hits such as “The Grinch,” “Sing” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” What makes the company’s output particularly appealing is that its movies cost between $70 million to $100 million to produce, far less than the $200 million that Disney typically spends. Next up, Illumination will release “The Super Mario Galaxy Movie” and “Minions 3,” both of which are expected to be among 2026’s biggest box office players. Title: President, Disney Television Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Erwich oversees a broad menu of programs and brands in his role leading ABC Entertainment, Hulu Originals, Freeform, Disney Channel and other kidvid platforms. He’s worked as a program buyer and seller, giving him the perspective and connections to juggle a high volume of development and production. Erwich has been key to Disney’s strategy of windowing “Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise” and other Hulu originals on ABC. “There’s the broadcast experience and the kind of shows that thrive there, but now there’s another window — and a very important and vibrant one for those shows — on Hulu,” Erwich told Variety in April. Title: Chair of TV Media, Paramount Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: George Cheeks is one of the few Paramount Global senior employees who came out of the Skydance acquisition with a prime spot at the top under David Ellison. Following a brief tenure as co-CEO of Paramount Global upon the exit of Bob Bakish, while also still acting as president and CEO of CBS. Now, Cheeks’ brands include CBS Television Network, CBS News and Stations, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, BET Studios, Nickelodeon TV Studios, See It Now Studios, MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET. Since Cheeks took over at CBS, the network, has launched hits including “Tracker,” “Fire Country,” “Ghosts” and “Matlock.” Cheeks came over to CBS in 2020 after a stint as co-chairman of NBC Entertainment. Title: Head of Theatrical and Streaming Films, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: The longtime Warner Bros. Pictures executive came to Amazon MGM following the ecommerce giant’s purchase of the studio that Variety famously dubbed “the Lion.” Valenti’s arrival was seen as sign that the enlarged studio operation was getting serious about revving up a slate of commercial theatrical films. Valenti’s experience ranges from Harry Potter franchise films to Baz Luhrmann’s “The Great Gatsby” to LEGO movies that helped revive Warner Bros.’ feature animation activity. Now she’s been entrusted with one of filmdom’s crown jewels, James Bond. Valenti’s first move was to turn to seasoned franchise film pros, Amy Pascal and David Heyman, to shepherd Agent 007 into a new chapter with a new star. Amazon MGM also has a big swing coming in June with Mattel’s followup to “Barbie,” the live-action “Masters of the Universe.” Title: CEO, Warner Music Group Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Kyncl has played captain at Warner Music Group as it’s undergone major restructuring, including last year’s elevation of Elliot Grainge to CEO of subsidiary Atlantic Music Group and waves of company-wide layoffs. And while full-year annual profit for 2025 declined 23%, largely due to the termination of WMG’s distribution deal with BMG, publishing and recorded music revenue thrived, surging 14.6 percent to $1.87 billion. Much of that can be credited to the success of various WMG artists — Rosé, Alex Warren and Sombr, to name a few. Under Kyncl’s leadership in 2025, WMG struck major licensing deals with AI startups Klay and Udio, the latter of which it had previously sued for copyright infringement. He has an ambitious blueprint to lead the company into the future — he even wrote a “10 year plan” for the company — but its execution will be a challenge. Title: Chairman, Sony Pictures Television Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Le Goy is a longtime Sony Pictures Entertainment insider who is well positioned to help drive the parent company’s efforts to find connections among the company’s autonomous entertainment-focused units: Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Music and Sony PlayStation. He previously headed worldwide distribution and networks, which gives him a strong sense of the company’s range of production and channel assets in the U.S. and abroad. Before Sony, Le Goy oversaw European distribution for Disney TV. Title: Head of Global TV, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: After a long run at Netflix, Peter Friedlander in October moved across town to lead global TV for Amazon MGM Studios. His front-row seat to the Netflix revolution will serve him well as Amazon MGM calibrates its TV strategy for Prime Video and elsewhere. Friedlander is extremely well connected in the creative community after years at Netflix and at Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman’s Playtone banner before that. All of those contacts and a big hunk of the goodwill he has in the bank will come in handy as the studio looks for growth. Title: CEO, Microsoft Gaming Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Beginning with an internship in 1988, Phil Spencer has been a Microsoft employee for longer than many of his biggest fans have been alive. Now head of Microsoft Gaming, Spencer oversees brands including Xbox, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Throughout many years at the company, Spencer has launched several consoles, including the current generation Xbox Series X and S and this year’s debut of the ROG Ally handheld collection, and overseen video game franchises including “Call of Duty,” “Minecraft,” “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Starfield,” “Doom” and “Forza.” While navigating industry criticism and fan backlash this year amid workforce reductions and price increases, Spencer has also drawn praise for his commitment to backing Xbox’s subscription Game Pass service and licensing out Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, making those the new priority drivers of growth as console sales dwindle. The successful adaptation of the “Fallout” gaming franchise into an Amazon Prime Video drama series was another feather in Spencer’s cap. Title: Chairman and CEO, Take-Two Interactive Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: Strauss Zelnick began his career in Hollywood at Columbia Pictures, home video distributor Vestron and Twentieth Century Fox. But he segued into big-league investing and video games nearly 20 years ago through his ZMC investment vehicle. Take-Two is home to one of gaming’s most valuable franchises, “Grand Theft Auto.” The company will be under renewed scrutiny in 2026 after multiple delays in the release of the long-waited “Grand Theft Auto VI.” The most recent was the news from November 2025 that the title would be pushed by six months from May to November 2026. By that time it will have been 13 year since the debut of “GTA 5.” Outside of Take-Two, Zelnick may well wind up with a bigger footprint in entertainment if ZMC finds opportunities in the M&A wave that is gripping traditional media and entertainment. Title: Founder, chairman and CEO, Roku Held job since: 2002 Sources of power: Wood has generally kept a low profile in Hollywood since his entrepreneurial drive lead him into media in the late 1990s. He represents the “Halt and Catch Fire” era of cutting-edge digital products and savvy business leaders that emerged from the tech boom in Texas in the 1980s and ‘90s. Wood was early to see the opportunity for more consumer-friendly on-demand platforms, and that positions Roku well for the future as streaming becomes the dominant TV and home entertainment delivery system. Title: Founder and CEO, Spotify Held job since: 2006 Sources of power: After more than two decades in his role at Spotify, Ek is poised to step down from CEO at the streaming company at the end of 2025 while remaining executive chairman. His making the change — to the degree he actually steps back — on a high note: Throughout his tenure, he made Spotify the premium destination for streaming and saved an industry that was collapsing under the weight of illegal downloading. He ushered Spotify to its current market cap of $118 billion and grew its audience to 713 million active users and 281 million subscribers, up more than 10% from 2024. Ek spent the year diversifying Spotify’s outside investments, inking a deal with Netflix to stream a collection of original podcasts and another with Amazon to give advertisers using Amazon DSP programmatic access to Spotify’s streaming audio and video inventory. Title: Co-CEO, Comcast Held job since: 2025 (announced to take effect in January) Sources of power: Will have significant say over company’s future direction as Roberts cedes some of his CEO duties.Cavanagh is taking more of the reins at Comcast as Brian Roberts looks to do more with exploring technology. He brings to Comcast an outlook forged in part by time on Wall Street. He was He was the co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s Corporate & Investment Bank from 2012 to 2014, and served as JPMorgan Chase’s CFO for six years. Look for Cavanagh to have a big say over Comcast’s policies governing potential mergers-and-acquisitions; investment in sports rights; and balancing the need to grow its streaming assets while keeping interest in its still-sizable linear TV footprint. Title: Chief Creative Officer, Pixar Animation Studios Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Pixar’s has had its highs and lows at the box office in recent years but the animation studio’s brand nonetheless remains a magnet for kid and family audiences. Docter stepped up to the top creative job in 2018 when the company faced a moment of sudden transition after the exit of longtime creative leader John Lasseter. Docter was one of Pixar’s first employees long before the pioneering CG animation shop was part of Disney. He is respected for maintaining Pixar’s culture of creativity even as it has stepped up its production slate. Title: VP of Film, Netflix Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Longtime Sony executive Belgrad has spent his career making theatrical movies across a spectrum of budgets, making him an ideal partner for Dan Lin at the Netflix film vertical. Belgrad, for starters, manages the streamer’s important relationship with pay-one partner Sony Pictures (the union that gave us the “KPop Demon Hunters” juggernaut). Belgrad has been vital to get live-action features for Netflix out of that deal, including the upcoming “People We Meet On Vacation” and Kevin Hart’s “72 Hours.” He’s also brought key new filmmakers into the fold — like Clint Bentley, Lena Dunham and James Mangold — and scored big auction packages including the “Eloise” movie with Amy Sherman-Palladino and producer Ryan Reynolds; as well as “Unabom” with Russell Crowe and Shailene Woodley. Title: President, Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: The exceedingly likable Greenbaum took a giant leap up from his longtime post at Searchlight Pictures to replace Sean Bailey at Disney’s mothership this year. He now oversees all live action filmmaking for the Walt Disney label and acts as steward for 20th Century Studios. Across both, he shepherds key filmmakers and – as the town has taken note – is actively courting original IP to serve younger audiences (particularly boys). Over his first few months, Greenbaum landed an action-drama package about the Hawaii mafia with Martin Scorsese and Dwayne Johnson, a hot time travel thriller from Edward Berger and Austin Butler, and the rights to Katherine Rundell’s fantasy series “Impossible Creatures.” Title: CEO, Neon Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Tom Quinn launched Neon in 2017 and quickly established it as one of the hottest brands in the indie film world. Under his leadership, Neon has become a major awards season player. It captured Best Picture for 2019’s “Parasite,” which made history as the first foreign film to win the top prize. Then pulled off the feat a second time with 2024’s “Anora,” a $6 million dark comedy that ranks as one of the lowest budgetted Best Picture victors ever. He’s also released such Oscar-nominated films as “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” and “I, Tonya.” Beyond arthouse fare, Neon scored at the box office with a series of twisty horror flicks, “The Monkey” and “Longlegs,” from Osgood Perkins, with whom the company has a first-look deal. However, Perkins’ latest film, “Keeper,” was a rare miss. In 2025, Neon released one of its most critically acclaimed slates, distributing Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just An Accident” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” both of which are expected to factor heavily into the Oscar race. Title: Chairman, Focus Features Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Peter Kujawski is a well-liked figure in the film community for his enthusiasm for movies and moviegoing, and for his taste in filmmakers and projects. He’s been a steady hand at Focus Features since 2016, but and he had an earlier run at the unit’s outset in 2002, where he played a big part in the releases of such notable pics as Michel Gondry’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” Sofia Coppola’s Lost In Translation” and Gus Van Sant’s “Milk.” His 2025 fall and winter slate was as an ambitious as any distributor that tackled adult dramas: “Bugonia,” “Hamnet” and “Song Sung Blue.” Title: CEO and Founder, Blumhouse Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Blum has made his mark in Hollywood with his distinctive approach to horror films and his financial prowess. In short, he figured out to do micro-budget production at scale. And even in a year when the much-anticipated sequel “MEGAN 2.0” fell flat, the company’s eight theatrical film releases in 2025 still passed the $1 billion mark at the box office. Blumhouse has also expanded significantly since the current iteration of the company was formed in 2015. This year, Blumhouse bolstered its core business by completing its merger with James Wan’s Atomic Monster. Title: Co-Founder, A24 Held job since: 2012 Sources of power: The eternally mysterious Fenkel and Katz, who won’t even agree to be photographed on the annual Oscars red carpet, continued their streak as one of the most enviable labels in indie film while quietly growing their company from within. A24 saw the most profitable run of its existence this year, largely thanks to the overperformance of Celine Song’s “Materialists” (over $100 million at the global box office on a $20 million budget). Strong singles and doubles came with Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” “Friendship” and “Bring Her Back,” and “Mary Supreme” is set to light up the specialty box office at Christmas. At the top of this year, Thrive Capital closed an investment round that sources say brings A24’s valuation to roughly $3.5 billion. Title: VP of Original Series, Netflix Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Howe got the nod to run original scripted series for the U.S. and Canada at Netflix after her longtime boss, Peter Friedlander, departed for a new gig as head of global series for Amazon MGM. Howe has been a key player for years in Netflix’s original content strategy, playing an instrumental role in such series as “Bridgerton,” the Emmy-winning “Beef” and “The Diplomat.” Now she’s heading up the biggest sandbox in series development. Title: Chairman, Bravo and Peacock Unscripted Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Berwick has seen her job description and title at NBCUniversal change numerous times over the past decade, but her focus rarely wavered. She has been the driving executive force behind Bravo even before NBC bought the cable channel in 2002. With NBCUniversal slimming down through the spinoff of USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, E!, Berwick’s new role in the restructuring unveiled in January 2025 is tailored to her strengths. That’s demonstrated by Peacock’s success with unscripted shows including “The Traitors’ and “Love Island USA” and the fans flocking to BravoCon events in recent years. Title: President, CBS Studios Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: David Stapf is among the elite list of top Hollywood executives who began their career in publicity and communications before transitioning into senior management. After helping launch iconic series like “Friends” and “ER” at Warner Bros. TV, he moved to a current programming job at CBS in 1999, stewarding series like “Everybody Loves Raymond.” In 2004 he moved over to CBS’ in-house studio, where he was key to the launch and growth of “NCIS” and its spinoffs. He also developed “The Good Wife” and its spinoffs with Robert and Michelle King, and is guiding Kathy Bates’ successful “Matlock” series. Stapf brought the “Star Trek” world back to life on TV with “Star Trek: Discovery,” “Picard,” “Lower Decks,” “Strange New Worlds” and “Starfleet Academy.” In late night, he oversaw the launches of Stephen Colbert’s and James Corden’s talkers — and their wind downs (including Colbert’s exit this coming May). And he launched the first new daytime soap in years, CBS’ “Beyond the Gates.” Stapf even expanded his domain as a supplier for streamers like Netflix, and as an international producer on shows including “Colin From Accounts” and “King & Conqueror.” Title: Chairman of Business Affairs and Operations, NBCUniversal Entertainment Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Jimmy Horowitz is widely respected as an honest broker and a shrewd dealmaker. He’s been a major player in driving business and monetization across the film studio for decades; more recently his purview has expanded to include television. He’s connections and his experience will no doubt come into play as NBCUniversal completes the Versant spinoff and reinvents itself once again around NBC, Universal film and TV production, Bravo and Peacock and theme parks. Title: President, Disney Television Studios and Global Original Television Strategy, Disney Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Schrier came up the ranks under John Langraf at FX, which gives him a level of respect and connections in the creative community that he will need to help reinvent Disney’s TV production operations. He was hand-picked by Dana Walden to steer the TV studios’ business operations. In recent years, Schrier has invested in time and resources into growing Disney’s local-language activity for Disney+ and other production activity outside the U.S. Title: President, Warner Bros. Television Group Held job since: 2024 Source of power: The future of Warner Bros. Television Group may be uncertain as Netflix and Paramount Skydance battle it out for the studio. But there’s no doubt that Paul has played an enormous role in the company’s success over the past 30 years. He’s a well regarded dealmaker who has always nurtured strong relationships with WB’s top talent. Title: President, ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: OConnell has the hard task of managing the operations of ABC News and leading business operations for Disney’s linear networks, including ABC, FX Networks, Freeform and National Geographic. She’s managing businesses that are inevitably in decline while Disney’s streaming platforms gain steam. But Disney is also working across the company to leverage the reach and deep footprint (for now) of ABC, FX and the larger cablers to help bolster Disney+ and Hulu and to squeeze more value out of high-priced premium shows. OConnell earned the esteem of her colleagues by handling the tricky transition of leadership at ABC News just a few months after her role was expanded to encompass the division. Title: CEO, AMC Networks Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Dolan has been slowly shifting the centers of gravity that the company she took over in February 2023. AMC Networks is home to AMC, SundanceTV, IFC, WeTV and BBC America, as well as streamers Shudder, Acorn TV and ALLBLK. Dolan worked with Netflix and HBO Max to find bigger showcases for AMC-branded shows. She also has pull as a member of the family that controls the closely held company. Title: CEO, AMC Theatres Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Adam Aron, who became the CEO of AMC Theatres in 2016, has learned to embrace the disruption. Over the past few years, he’s survived a pandemic that devastated his business and withstood rollercoaster share prices amid a box office that has failed to regain its pre-pandemic strength. Rather than relying entirely on the studios that supply the blockbusters, Aron has made several attempts to expand AMC’s business outside of box office, including the viral “Dune” popcorn bucket and other movie-themed merchandise that has contributed tens of millions in annual sales. He also spearheaded the chain’s foray into distribution with 2023’s commercial hit “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” concert film and this year’s “Taylor Swift: The Release Party of a Showgirl.” And he turned AMC into the de facto choice for movie lovers after hiring Nicole Kidman for the chain’s now-iconic promotional campaign to get people back to the movies. (Patrons even petitioned when AMC attempted to shorten the commercial, in which Kidman famously declares that “somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.”) Now that’s movie magic. Title: CEO, Imax Corp. Held job since: 2009 Sources of power: Blockbuster directors and stars like Christopher Nolan, Tom Cruise and Ryan Coogler are known to rhapsodize about the singular experience of watching their films in Imax, a premium film format that has skyrocketed in popularity since COVID. That makes Richard Gelfond, who controls access to the finite number of screens that tend to generate outsized ticket sales, a very popular person when those mega-watt talents have a new movie to unveil. Thanks to Gelfond’s key relationships, Imax has benefited in recent years as audiences opt for premium large formats to distinguish the out-of-the-home moviegoing experience. When Gelfond joined Imax in 1994, the company was best known for supplying science documentaries to theaters inside museums. Over the decades, Gelfond, who became CEO in 2009, has turned the technology brand into a legitimate powerhouse in Hollywood. Title: President, Paramount Television Studios Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Matt Thunell sits atop Paramount Television Studios operations, a unit formed in August, post-merger out of the assets of Skydance Television, Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Nickelodeon Live Action and Awesomeness. He’s got an opportunity to rev up a franchise factory for the enlarged studio. Paramount TV Studios is home to the Taylor Sheridan-verse, Paramount+’s “Yellowjackets,” among other shows. Thunell worked on “Stranger Things” at Netflix before he joined Skydance to head the TV unit in 2022. Title: CEO, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2017 Sources of power: Grode may not be as flashy as some chiefs in town, but his stable of intellectual property provides all the shine he needs to keep Legendary at the top of the popcorn conversation. 2025 brought the staggering success of “A Minecraft Movie,” the almost billion-dollar-grosser that Grode’s studio executed with Warner Bros. While Legendary will be moving south of Burbank for a new distribution pact with Paramount, the label will release a third “Dune” film in 2026, as well as more monsters from the Godzilla universe and a hotly anticipated adaptation of beloved arcade game “Street Fighter.” Title: Vice Chair of Worldwide Production, Legendary Entertainment Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Parent’s range of experience — from a long run at Universal Pictures to MGM to New Line Cinema early in her career — gives her the perspective and business connections to drive promising film and TV projects for Legendary. Her depth alone makes Legendary an attractive partner for studios looking for reliable popcorn fare. Title: President, Searchlight Pictures Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: Greenfield rose up the leadership ladder at Searchlight after working as a film producer and at the Sundance Institute. He’s highly regarded in the industry for his taste and for championing strong filmmakers. He was a key player in helping Searchlight make the transition into Disney after the 21st Century Fox acquisition in 2019. Title: CEO, Fox Entertainment Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Rob Wade was already a reality TV veteran in the U.K. (“Big Brother,” “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here”) when he crossed the pond in 2005 to work on the first season of ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars.” He eventually became the showrunner of “DWTS.” He also headed up U.S. TV at Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment, working on shows like “America’s Got Talent” and “The X Factor.” After a stint as head of entertainment development at BBC Worldwide, Wade joined Fox in 2017 as president of alternative entertainment and specials, overseeing an unscripted slate such as “The Masked Singer,” “Lego Masters” and “Hell’s Kitchen.” He was there when Disney acquired Fox’s studio operations, making the network a stand-alone indie — and giving him and then-CEO Charlie Collier license to be entrepreneurial. When Collier left for Roku in 2022, Wade was tapped by Lachlan Murdoch to continue leading Fox’s evolution in entertainment. Title: President and CEO, Starz Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Starz is settling into its next chapter after completing a long and complicated spinoff process from parent company Lionsgate. Now Hirsch and his team have more control to guide Starz’s transition away from linear cable to subscription streaming. Hirsch’s background in marketing has helped Starz make the most of its most popular franchises such as the “Power” drama series and the “Outlander” fantasy universe. Title: President and Chairman, A+E Global Media Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Buccieri has worked to transform A+E Global Media’s operations since he was promoted to the top job in 2018. He’s made savvy licensing deals that protected the company’s core business but generated cash flow from the FAST channel licensing bonanza of the past few years. Under Buccieri, Lifetime, History and A&E Network have gained respect for investing in a slate of event programs rather than joining the original series arms race. He’s also highly regarded as a manager – skills he will need as parent companies Disney and Hearst quietly shop their long-standing joint venture to prospective buyers. Title: Chair & Chief Creative Officer, Lionsgate Television Group Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: In an industry filled with executive shuffles and organizational changes, Kevin Beggs has been a stalwart at Lionsgate Television Group. He first joined the company when it was a much smaller entity and helped grow it over the years to critical acclaim with signature hits like “Mad Men,” “Weeds” and “Orange Is the New Black.” This year, Lionsgate earned 25 Emmy nominations — including 23 Emmy nods for Apple TV+’s “The Studio,” which went on to win a record-breaking 13 Emmys — the most ever for a comedy in a single season. Overseeing a group that includes Lionsgate TV, Lionsgate Alternative TV, Lionsgate Worldwide TV Distribution, 3 Arts Entertainment and Debmar-Mercury, Beggs boasts current series hits including Season 5 of “Ghosts” (CBS), “The Hunting Wive” (Netflix), Season 3 of “Power Book IV: Force” (Starz), “Spartacus: House of Ashur” (Starz), “The Rainmaker” (USA Network), Season 13 of “My Big Fat Fabulous Life” (TLC) and the syndicated strips “Family Feud” and “Sherri.” In addition, 3 Arts is involved with shows like “Hacks” (HBO Max) and “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix). Title: Global Head of Music, YouTube Held job since: 2016 Sources of power: Cohen is coming up on a decade of steering music activity for the streaming behemoth. His deep background in the business have come in handy as YouTube debates issues around AI use in the making of music and videos showcased on the site. More recently he’s waded into a dispute with Variety’s sibling publication Billboard about how YouTube streams are counted in Billboard’s chart rankings of music sales. Title: VP of Audio, Twitch and Games, Amazon Held job since: 2012/2023 Sources of power: A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Boom’s remit sprawls across Amazon Music, Audible, Twitch, Amazon Games, and Creator Services, the latter of which is a new program that leads the company’s creator-led podcast studio under the Wondery brand, including Dax Shepard’s Golden Globe-nominated “Armchair Expert,” “Mind the Game” with Lebron James and “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce. Initiatives in the past year include Bad Bunny’s final San Juan residency show, “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,” which became Amazon Music’s all-time most-watched livestream; working with Bad Bunny to launch STEM education programs, agricultural support, and economic development in Puerto Rico; welcoming media-challenged artists like Justin Bieber and Lizzo to Twitch; and developing Alexa+ into a music-recommendation tool. Title: President, Crunchyroll Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: As anime fandom has grown exponentially, Crunchyroll is well positioned to capture subscribers, audience and street cred with fans. The subscription streaming platform owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment has been a success story for the studio, which has made a point of investing in anime assets. Crunchyroll’s emergence on a larger stage was cemented in September when its feature film “Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle” lead the U.S. box office for two weekends. Purini has deep credentials with fans thanks to his long run at anime shop Funimation before Sony engineered its merger with Crunchyroll in 2021. Title: Chairman and CEO, AEG Presents Held job since: 2011 Sources of power: In any other universe, the man at the top of a live-entertainment empire that includes Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour, Elton John’s five-year “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” trek, the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history (Zach Bryan at Michigan Stadium: 112,408 fans), the Rolling Stones’ recent tours, Coachella, Stagecoach, Sabrina Carpenter, Morgan Wallen and much more would be the Goliath of his industry. However, AEG Live’s main competition is the mighty Live Nation. But Marciano and his AEG Live team give Rapino & Co. a run for their money every year. Partnerships — with Louis Messina for Swift, with Goldenvoice’s Paul Tollett for Coachella and Stagecoach, with Latin powerhouse CMN Events — are a key strength, and he’s also more than doubled the company’s venue portfolio to over 100 (which include L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena and the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas), and also runs other iconic events like London’s BST Hyde Park, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and many more across the globe. Titles: Co-Founders and Co-Presidents, Sony Pictures Classics Held job since: 1992 Sources of power: “Michael and Tom,” as they are unanimously known, are part of the furniture here in Hollywood. They are lifelong devotees of art house titles that, more often than not, find a foothold in the mainstream and keep their parent label Sony Pictures in the awards conversation each year. For 2025, they rolled out Jodie Foster’s psychological murder mystery “A Private Life” and Iraq’s stellar bet for this year’s Oscars in “The President’s Cake.” And they may have a dark horse best actor winner on their hands for Ethan Hawke in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon.” Title: Founder, Chairman and CEO, Allen Media Group Held job since: 1993 Sources of power: Byron Allen has demonstrated that he has tenacity to spare in building the media company that he started with a single syndicated TV show that he hosted. Today, Allen Media Group encompasses more than a dozen TV stations in small- and medium-size markets, the Weather Channel and niche lifestyle and genre channels. He’s been expanding in streaming with the college sports and lifestyle platform HBCUGo platform. He also owns the indie film distribution service Freestyle Digital Media. Title: Chief Brand Officer, Walt Disney Co.; President, Disney Entertainment Marketing Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Asad Ayaz has the single-biggest marketing portfolio of any CMO in entertainment. And because Disney is Disney, he has the extra burden of serving as both promoter and protector of the big-D brand that is synonymous with America, apple pie and Mickey Mouse. Ayaz also has a huge remit in overseeing all ballyhoo activity at the studio’s film and TV production imprints and Disney+. Title: President of Marketing, Direct to Consumer and Disney Entertainment Television Held Job Since: 2025 Sources of power: Ryan oversees a roster of platforms and brands of size and scope that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. With her promotion in August, Ryan added oversight of all Disney’s direct to consumer marketing in addition to Disney’s TV studios and linear channels. The job of bringing viewers to the screen has become more complicated in the subscription streaming age. It falls to Ryan and her teams to help build up Disney’s growth engines of the future. Title: Head of Marketing, Amazon MGM Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Sue Kroll is skilled at selling movies. The former Warner Bros marketing chief was responsible for major promotional campaigns, including “Harry Potter,” “Lord of the Rings” and Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, as well as awards fare like “Argo” and “The Blind Side.” So when Amazon MGM decided to get into the theatrical business and ramp up its film slate, the studio recruited Kroll – reuniting her with Courtenay Valenti, Amazon MGM’s head of film and Warner Bros. former production chief – to market its movies to the masses. The studio admittedly hasn’t had a ton of theatrical offerings since Amazon MGM committed to the big screen. (Making movies takes time.) So 2026 releases, including the Chris Pratt-led “Mercy,” Ryan Gosling’s space drama “Project Hail Mary” and Colleen Hoover adaptation “Verity,” will be a better showcase of Kroll’s talent. And once they get around to casting the next James Bond, she’ll be responsible for shaking and stirring the 007 franchise for a new generation. Title: Chief Marketing Officer, Universal Pictures Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Moses is one of filmdom’s most respected and well-liked marketing mavens. He has the experience and the No. 1 opening weekends to back it up. His latest victory that impressed fellow CMOs far and wide was his assignment to open not one but two movie musicals tied to a beloved Broadway property with a one-year gap in between. Moses and his team made sure that you couldn’t miss the candy-colored fanfare for “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good.” Next up he faces a Homeric challenge with the release of Christopher Nolan’s “The Odyssey” in July. Title: CEO, ITV Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: McCall has carefully managed ITV’s response to the rapidly changing business landscape for media. She took the reins after her predecessor acquired a slew of small production banners to feed the company’s content pipelines. She came in as a strong experienced executive manager who helped quiet the persistent rumors that ITV would be sold, although that may change as another wave of merger mania grips Hollywood. Title: CEO, Canal+ Group Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: Maxime Saada, a shrewd businessman whose mantra is “buy less, own more,” has transformed Canal+ Group from a largely French pay-TV operator into a leaner, financially robust global media company spanning Europe, Africa and Asia. Since taking the helm in 2015, Saada has quadrupled the group’s subscriber base to more than 40 million across 70 countries, while tightening cost structures, cutting losses and sustaining a €5 billion annual investment in content. Saada joined Canal+ Group in 2004 and moved through the ranks, has fueled the company’s growth through targeted acquisitions, including stakes in The Pictures Company in the U.S., Nordic pay-TV group Viaplay and Asian streamer Viu, capped this year by the takeover of MultiChoice Group, cementing Canal+’s leadership in Africa. In parallel, Saada secured a 34% stake in UGC, reinforcing vertical integration alongside Studiocanal, the producer behind “Paddington.” Title: Chairman and CEO, Mediawan Held job since: 2015 Sources of power: In an industry reshaped by consolidation and volatility, Capton has engineered a rare European success story with Mediawan. The self-made French producer co-founded Mediawan with telecom billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse as a special-purpose acquisition vehicle in 2015. Ten years and (likely) over a thousand transatlantic flights later, Capton has turned Mediawan into one of Europe’s leading production-distribution players amid a fiercely competitive market, generating upwards of $1 billion in annual revenues and housing over 80 labels worldwide, including the producers of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Miraculous” and “Call My Agent” — with a movie spinoff in post boasting George Clooney and Eva Longoria cameos, and a U.S. remake set in the sports representation worlds with HBO and SpringHill. Capton has been the architect of this international expansion, gaining the trust of high-profile talent and spearheading headline-making acquisitions that put the company on the English-language map, including majority stakes in Oscar-winning banners such as Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner’s Plan B (“Adolescence,””F1”), and “Slow Horses” producer See-Saw Films. Capton also just enlisted Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap for a joint venture based in London. Title: Founder and CEO, Mubi Held job since: 2007 Sources of power: A Turkish-born film fanatic, Efe Cakarel had never been to a film festival when he wrote the business plan for Mubi in 2007, envisioning an edgier alternative to Netflix. Eighteen years later, the London-headquartered company has evolved from a niche streamer into a full-fledged studio spanning theatrical distribution and production, with more than 400 employees across 15 markets. Mubi broke through in the U.S. with Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror breakout “The Substance,” which it distributed in theaters and grossed $83 million worldwide in 2024. It also earned five Oscar nominations, which meant that the ceremony last March marked Cakarel’s first trip to the Academy Awards. Cakarel, who says he “built Mubi brick by brick,” remains bullish on reinvigorating moviegoing culture. Title: Vice Chair, CJ Group Held job since: 2004 Sources of power: Miky Lee has spent the past two decades building the infrastructure that helped rebuild Korean’s entertainment industry. Appointed vice chair in 2004, she oversaw CJ’s shift from domestic film and TV operations into a vertically integrated entertainment group with reach across Asia and the U.S. Under her watch, CJ-backed projects included Oscar winner “Parasite,” while platforms like KCON and the Mnet Asian Music Awards grew from local showcases into international fixtures. As global demand accelerated, Lee pushed CJ further into the U.S., backing CJ ENM’s majority acquisition of Endeavor Content, now Fifth Season, and the launch of the First Light StoryHouse label with Janet Yang. As Korean film, TV and music have broken firmly into the U.S. mainstream, Lee remains behind one of the few companies built to operate across all three at scale. Title: CEO, Banijay Entertainment and Banijay Live Held job since: 2013 Sources of power: Marco Bassetti is navigating the current age of consolidation without losing sight of the bottom line. As streamer budgets shrink and linear channels lose relevance he is judiciously continuing to grow the company’s footprint while attaining scale with a wide range of premium content. Scale gives Banijay leverage in its negotiations with streaming giants and bolsters its efforts to retain IP ownership rather than selling it outright. The company’s production side, that includes brands such as “MasterChef,” “Big Brother,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Black Mirror,” is looking to expand its reach in English-speaking markets, including the U.S., though Bassetti is not planning to compete directly with Hollywood studios in the scripted sphere. Diversifying beyond traditional TV content, Banijay since 2023 holds a majority stake in live entertainment outfit Balich Wonder Studios that is driving growth thanks to production of high-profile events such as the opening ceremony of the upcoming Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Banijay has also made inroads in the creator-led entertainment space, notably its Creators Lab launched with YouTube. Title: CEO, Versant Media Held job since: 2025 Sources of power: Lazarus has taken on the job of transitioning NBCUniversal’s largest linear cable channels into a new company dubbed Versant Media, which will formally become a separate publicly traded entity from NBCUniversal in early 2026. Lazarus is well positioned to steer those outlets — USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel – into their next chapter given his roots in pay TV as a Turner Broadcasting alum. He’s exiting out of NBCUniversal after a 15-year run. Title: Chairman, NBCUniversal Media Group Held job since: 2024 Sources of power: NBCUniversal is investing heavily in sports and entertainment franchises. Matt Strauss’ job is to make sure the company makes a profit. NBCU has in recent months tested some unique strategies, including the launch of a new sports-focused cable network that delivers much of the content already available to users of Peacock. The new outlet lets people still connected to traditional systems enjoy the content and serves as a bargaining chip in negotiations with video distributors. Title: President, Sony Pictures Television Studios Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Pope has had a broad range of experience over the past 25 years, from rising fast at NBC to helping to launch Chernin Entertainment and Charter Spectrum’s programming venture. All of that background is helping her lead Sony Pictures Television. It’s the studio division that takes the company’s riskiest bets in scripted TV. SPT fielded a notable new series this year for Fox with the medical drama “Doc,” which debuted to strong reviews and audience in January. The series came back quickly — by design — with Season 2 debuting in September just as Season 1 episodes landed on Netflix. Title: Chief Financial Officer, Warner Bros. Discovery Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Wiedenfels is on track to take on the tough assignment of charting a future course for CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, Food Network and other WBD linear channels. If Paramount prevails in buying all of WBD, however, Wiedenfels won’t have an empire. Although the executive became a lightning rod amid WBD’s extensive cost cutting campaigns, Wiedenfels will be sought after as a media CEO after his experience restructuring WBD. Title: President, Disney Advertising Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Ferro has become a key figure in Disney’s TV kingdom as the company opened Disney+ to advertising and has expanded in streaming with ESPN and Hulu. She has deep knowledge of Disney’s operations and the value of Disney’s biggest brands. She’s earned the trust of Disney’s C-suite after delivering for the Mouse House in difficult times. Title: Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal Held job since: 2023 Sources of power: Marshall has grown his stature at NBCUniversal ever since he became the top executive in advertising sales. He distinguished himself in sales for the 2024 Paris Olympics and this year’s “Saturday Night Live” 50th anniversary celebration. He’s also been a driver of the company’s upcoming plans to celebrate NBC’s 100th anniversary and to go big on live sports. Title: President, Roku Media Held job since: 2022 Sources of power: Collier was recruited to rev up Roku’s core media business by stepping up original content commissions and enhancing its advertising sales operation. Collier has worked to capitalize on Roku’s strengths by targeting its original series to complement trends and popular shows on channels and apps carried by Roku. He has also expanded its presence on Madison Avenue, tapping into his decades of experience in programming and ad sales. Title: Group CEO, Fremantle Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: If you’re in the business of game shows, then you’re in business with Fremantle. Mullin leads the production banner behind “American Idol,” “So You Think You Can Dance” and a host of game shows ranging from “The Price is Right” to “Family Feud.” On Mullin’s watch Fremantle has also expanded its efforts in scripted content. Title: CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation Studios Held job since: 2019 Sources of power: Hulst oversees more than 20 individual studio groups and partnerships, which are responsible for some the industry’s most influential games including “The Last of Us,” “Ghost of Yotei,” “God of War,” “Helldivers II” and “Death Stranding 2.” While he was pulled back from serving as co-CEO of the PlayStation business overall earlier this year, Hulst holds significant power in the gaming biz and guides SIE’s film and TV strategy. Title: CEO, Mattel Held job since: 2018 Sources of power: Yes, Kreiz is interested in selling toys — lots of them — across multiple different categories (dolls, toddler, preschool and more). But he’s repositioned the company to better exploit opportunities in other lines of business with Mattel’s fan-favorite brands, including with the company’s first movie: box-office bonanza “Barbie,” which indisputably became a cultural moment. He has loaded up more projects in the pipeline in film, TV, consumer products, games, live events and experiences, publishing and music. Kreiz’s background as CEO of Fox Kids Europe, Maker Studios and Endemol over the past three decades affords him a keen understanding of how to capitalize on the value of Mattel’s multigenerational fandoms through media. Title: Founder and CEO, Epic Games Held job since: 1991 Sources of power: Sweeney’s company parachuted into the zeitgeist with the hugely popular “Fortnite,” and the game’s success last year attracted Disney as a major strategic partner. The outspoken — if not combative — exec also has stood up to tech giants Apple and Google, battling them in court to try to force them to make their app store policies fairer for independent developers. Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine 3D graphics platform has been eagerly embraced by professional vfx artists and creators for its ease of use. Title: Chair, Dalian Wanda Group Held job since: 1988 Sources of power: For a decade, Wang Jianlin was the most visible symbol of China’s global entertainment ambitions, snapping up marquee Western assets and building the world’s largest cinema footprint. That expansion unwound after Beijing tightened controls on outbound capital and targeted highly leveraged overseas acquisitions, forcing Wanda into debt restructuring and the exit from assets such as AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment. What remains is narrower but durable. While Wang no longer controls Wanda Film, Wanda Cinemas continue to operate at scale under a brand synonymous with his legacy and are largely housed within Wanda Plaza properties he still owns. Overseas, Hoyts preserves exhibition muscle in Australia and New Zealand. Most resilient is Infront Sports & Media, whose grip on premium sports rights anchors Wang’s influence beyond film. His power now rests in infrastructure rather than dealmaking. The Business of Entertainment

Title: 5 MMO Games We Almost Got (And Why They Were Never Made)
URL: http://comicbook.com/gaming/list/mmos-never-released/
Time Published: 2025-12-23T17:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Brandon Zachary Game development on the most basic of titles is tricky enough, but massively multiplayer online role-playing games are a different beast entirely. MMORPGs have to be a big enough world to justify a player’s lengthy time commitment, while also being entertaining and engaging enough to keep them from migrating to other titles. The biggest MMORPGs (like Blizzard’s World of Warcraft and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile) have massive player bases, and there are other consistent titles in the genre like Star Wars: The Old Republic and DC Universe Online. However, there have been some heartbreaking cancellations over the years that resulted in some promising concepts never making it out of development. Here are some of the most exciting MMORPGs that players never got to dive into. Codenamed “Titan,” the Halo MMORPG was sent to bring Master Chief into the RPG space. Developed by Ensemble Studios, the game was initially inspired by the success of Ultima Online. The concept for a sci-fi-heavy MMORPG became a passion project for the developer. After the success of Halo: Combat Evolved, the sci-fi MMORPG was retrofitted into a Halo title and had a number of functional similarities to the hit Blizzard game. Intended to be a rival to World of Warcraft, Ensemble Studios split attention between this game and the RTS adaptation of the Halo franchise, Halo Wars. Although the game pioneered several concepts that would later be brought to life by other MMORPGs, leadership changes at Microsoft and the inevitable investment it would take time to turn a Halo MMORPG into a money maker resulted in the game being shut down. Amazon’s move into the world of gaming was an ambitious play that didn’t end up landing as well as the company had hoped. This resulted in some serious cuts to Amazon’s gaming teams in October. One of the biggest casualties of this was an open-world MMO game set during the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Developed by Amazon Games Orange County (the same team that produced New World: Aeternum), the game was formally announced in 2023 and described as being in early development. While the game would have benefited from Amazon’s resources and the natural connection to Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power TV show, the team reportedly had trouble figuring out how to make the game stand out from other fantasy MMORPGs like Standing Stone Games’ The Lord of the Rings Online and World of Warcraft. Amazon Gaming has shut down many of its games as part of its recent layoffs, with reports suggesting that the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was among the games impacted and shut down by the cuts. EverQuest has been one of the most consistent MMORPG franchises in gaming history, launching in 1999 with the first entry in the series and eventually getting sequels like the PS2’s EverQuest Online Adventures and 2004’s EverQuest II. Formally announced in 2012, EverQuest Next was intended to be a fresh take on the material and would have featured the biggest sandbox world developed at the time. Development carried on for several years under the eye of Daybreak Game Company, which has successfully launched several MMORPGs over the years. Although the game was intended to launch on the PlayStation 4 and was even suggested to have some compatibility with the Oculus Rift, plans for the game came to a halt in 2016. According to the game’s development team, the team couldn’t find a way to make the expansive game “fun,” and the title was cancelled. Fans of EverQuest still have the earlier titles, with the most recent expansion launching in December 2025. Announced in 2010, Rockman Online was a collaboration between Capcom and Neowiz Games. Taking place in the distant future of the Mega Man/Mega Man X series, Rockman Online would have brought back the Maverick Virus and required the construction of several duplicate machines modeled after series mainstays X, Zero, Duo, and Cinnamon to combat the hordes of new corrupted robots. The game was in active development for two years, with gameplay trailers even revealing a 2.5D platforming gameplay style that felt consistent with the franchise’s history. Production moved along far enough that trailers and gameplay clips were revealed to the public, showcasing multiple Mega Man characters fighting alongside one another. There was even a promotional contest to let two lucky winners name characters in the game. However, management shifts at Neowiz Games pushed the game to the back burner, and it was formally cancelled in 2013. Stargate Worlds was an ambitious collaboration by Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment and the MGM film studio. The game was announced in 2006 and was set to be directly based on the cult classic series, Stargate SG-1. Game publisher FireSky became involved in 2008, announcing they were committed to helping bring the best game possible to life. However, in 2009, Stargate SG-1 co-creator Brad Wright (who had been brought into the development as a games creative consultant) revealed his doubts that the game would ever see the light of day. Although there were plans for a closed beta version of the game, and members of the press at the time were impressed by the early previews of the game, Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment filed for bankruptcy in 2010.

Title: Google tells staff it will ramp up green card applications again in 2026. Here's who won't be eligible.

Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google told employees it will be "ramping up" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card. The company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. PERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US. Tech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to "significant" delays, Business Insider reported. According to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience. The memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered. "Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible," the memo read. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role. Google paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. The sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers. Google applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said. Google told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said. It also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are "not in good standing" with the company. "Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM," it read. MI means "moderate impact" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews. Have something to share?

Title: The biggest games industry news stories of 2025 | Year in Review
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-biggest-games-industry-news-stories-of-2025-year-in-review
Time Published: 2025-12-22T18:33:46Z

AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

Title: Microsoft layoffs: Perfect Dark VA says she recorded “entire chapters” before Xbox canceled reboot

New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. I’m guessing OP didn’t get a new car as a gift, so… got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a “free turkey” around the holidays. It wasn’t really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didn’t cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurant’s “signature” steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. We’ve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat ‘for the company’. We didn’t get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Still, investors are happy with the work Google is doing. Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.

When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to

Title: Job seekers in 2025 faced a Great Frustration: never-ending applications, ghosting after interviews, and losing hope

Call it the Great Freeze — or the Great Frustration. Business Insider spoke with dozens of job seekers across generations in 2025, some of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. They voiced a wide range of frustrations about their searches — including slow hiring timelines, so-called "ghost jobs," suspected ageism, employers going silent midway through the process, overwhelming competition for each role, and the belief that AI filters are often screening their résumés before a human ever sees them. Their job-finding journeys come at a time when employers are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. Whether the job seekers blame AI, corporate efficiency pushes, or broader economic uncertainty, they say it all adds up to a deluge of applications and a dearth of job offers. Still, through the frustration, they've also found ways to cope and connect with a community of fellow job seekers. "I believe the hiring system is broken," said Matthew English, who's been looking for full-time work since October 2024 after a decadeslong career in accounting. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs — from accounting roles to the Chick-fil-A cow mascot — he's been unable to secure a full-time offer. He said he's burned through much of his savings, and that last Christmas, he couldn't afford to buy gifts for his family. "I have about drained my life's savings," said English, who is in his 60s and lives in Alabama. "Money that you're expecting to use in retirement is now being used to survive." The New York Fed regularly asks people to estimate the likelihood that, if they lost their job today, they'd be able to find a new one in the next three months. In August 2025, that average probability dropped to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013 — and has only recovered slightly in the months since. Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said 2025's labor market had "low momentum." "The cumulative effect of three years of slowdown — it's completely understandable why they feel like this might be the worst labor market they've ever been in," Kantenga said. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by emailing jzinkula@businessinsider.com or mhoff@businessinsider.com. Read more on the topic: Hilary Nordland began looking for work after being laid off from her marketing role in July 2024. To help pay the bills, she said she started donating plasma and drew on her retirement savings. Nordland, who's in her 50s and lives in Minnesota, said one of the most frustrating parts of her job search has been landing interviews — only to have opportunities fall through for unexpected reasons. She said she's had interviews canceled the same day they were scheduled because the role was suddenly put on hold or filled internally. On one occasion, she said, an HR representative told her she'd be a great fit — but the rep was fired before they could schedule the interview. "This job market is terrifying," she said. "It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through." US employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts so far in 2025, the most since 2020. While the unemployment rate remains relatively low by historical standards, it has risen to its highest level since 2021, when the economy was still recovering from pandemic-related disruptions. High demand for jobs — combined with the rise of AI-assisted applications — has contributed to an influx of submissions for open roles, making it harder for qualified candidates to stand out. Last quarter, the average job posting received 242 applications, nearly three times the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. Aaron Terrazas, an independent economist, said job seekers' frustration with this year's labor market was justified. "Just because the aggregate jobs data look stable, steady, slowing but stable, doesn't mean that it hasn't been very difficult for some people," Terrazas said. Heather Driscoll began looking for a healthcare management job after being laid off last year. She said she's struggled to pay the bills and had to draw on her 401(k). "The amount of time, research, enthusiasm — the dressing up, hair, makeup — just to sit on a Zoom call and get no feedback or rejection, is insane," she said. Driscoll, who's in her 50s and lives in Colorado, said she has reached the final interview round multiple times but has been unable to secure an offer. She suspects that ageism and sexism could be working against her. A challenging job market has forced some job seekers to confront the possibility that their goals and aspirations may be out of reach. At age 40, Kenneth Ferraro quit his job as a truck driver to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science at New York University. He hoped it would set him up for a career in public service — but after struggling to find work, he returned to trucking last year. He said he's stuck with more than $100,000 in student debt. While having a college degree improved his credentials, Ferraro said he thought his age had held him back in the job market. He recalled applying for an entry-level government position that seemed like a good fit. The early stages of the interview process felt promising, but he said things shifted after the in-person interview — and he suspects his age was a factor. "As soon as the hiring manager saw me, his whole demeanor changed," Ferraro said. "He ran through the questions and never truly engaged with me." Solomon Jones hoped that earning a college degree would open doors. After earning his bachelor's degree in sports communication in May, he struggled to find employment. Jones said that some of the sports communications job postings he'd come across had attracted more than 1,000 applicants. "The goal is to obviously get a job in the sports industry, but realistically, I know that life isn't fair," said Jones, who's in his 20s and lives in New Jersey. "So at this point, I'm just trying to find a job, period." Some job seekers Business Insider spoke with have leaned on others — including friends, family, professional contacts, and fellow job seekers — for support and solidarity during their job searches. After being laid off by Microsoft in May, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment, but eventually moved to Florida to save money by living with family while continuing his search. Carter said he's connected with others who've lost their jobs and visits the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout Microsoft's history. "Layoffs kind of affect people mentally," said Carter, who's in his 30s. "I've reached out to people so we can be each other's support system." In July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off by Intel for the second time. On his last official day with the company, his wife also lost her job. When he learned the news, his mindset shifted from "I'll find a job when I can" to "I'd better find a job." But over the past few months, he's struggled to make much headway. Ramkrishna said one of the things keeping him going is the support of his former Intel colleagues, who also lost their jobs. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said uncertainty helped drive this year's low-fire, low-hire job market, such as businesses navigating the effects of tariffs and AI. Terrazas, the independent economist, doesn't think uncertainty will fully fade next year, but said employers won't be facing the initial shock of policy changes from a new administration. Most job seekers can't afford to put their searches on hold until conditions improve. Despite the challenges, some have managed to break through. When Alexander Valen was laid off from his project manager role at Accenture, he was initially optimistic that his more than two decades of experience would help him land a new job. But after nearly two years of job searching — and falling behind on his mortgage — that optimism had vanished. Valen, who's in his 50s and lives in Florida, said he and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and help from family to get by. But a few months ago, someone in his network recommended he explore roles at the freelance platform Toptal. Valen applied for a project manager role, went through the interview process, and landed the position, which he said fell within the $80 to $100 an hour compensation range he'd been targeting. Valen's top advice for other job seekers: Reframe how you view the process — and lean on others along the way. "The search becomes far less discouraging when you treat it as an opportunity to grow rather than a verdict on your worth," he said. "And in a market this competitive, networking isn't optional — it's the force multiplier that ultimately led me to my role." Jump to

Title: Pick up 2025's most underrated RPG during the Steam Winter Sale

There's certainly no shortage of choice when it comes to what to buy during the Steam Winter Sale. Hundreds, if not thousands, of games are available for cheaper than ever before. While the Featured Deep Discounts and sales for some of the biggest games of the year are worth looking at, the Steam Winter Sale is also a great time to get some of 2025's most underrated games. Specifically, for fans of tabletop role-playing games and games that explore the different ways we interact with the medium, I'd highly recommend Secret Door and Dreamhaven's Sunderfolk. Typically $50, Sunderfolk is discounted by 40% to just $30 during this Steam Winter Sale. If you're willing to use your phone to control a tactics RPG with some friends, you'll discover one of the most underrated games of the year. In 2020, former Activision Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime founded Dreamhaven, a new game publisher and parent company to multiple development studios. Sunderfolk was the first internally developed game that they released, and it was quite the bold swing for a first game. It's a cooperative, turn-based tactical RPG meant to be a digital replacement for your tabletop board game night. In it, you play as cute animals who fit classic RPG archetypes like tank, warrior, and mage, and go on missions with your friends to save the home village of Arden. I personally like playing as the Pyromancer, a salamander that powers up by stepping into the fire his attacks leave behind on tiles. Actress Anjali Bhimani also put in impressive work for Sunderfolk, voicing every single character and the narrator in the game. The one catch, if you want to call it that, in all of this is that you have to use an app on your phone to control your character in Sunderfolk. Your on-screen cursor movement, move selection, and character upgrades between missions are all handled from a smartphone screen. That may sound gimmicky and off-putting to some, but buy in and you'll actually find this setup feels surprisingly intuitive. Mechanically, it's an impressive tactics game, with varied mission objectives, unique player abilities, and creative ways for players to interact and assist one another. If you can wrangle up a group of friends to play the game (only one copy is required), it truly offers some of the most fun of any multiplayer game released in 2025. It's even possible to play it alone, although that's not ideal. Regardless, Sunderfolk is an incredibly charming game that I wish more people knew about. While I really enjoy Sunderfolk and its Jackbox-meets-D&D approach to multiplayer RPG gaming, it was not an overnight success for Dreamhaven following its launch in April of this year. According to a Bloomberg report, it sold only about 62,000 copies in its first four months on the market. Its Android app has 100,000+ downloads. Layoffs did occur at Dreamhaven in August. I credit Sunderfolk's underperformance to a couple of different factors. First, it's hard to convince hardcore RPG video game fans to adopt such a complex way to play a new RPG due to the stigma surrounding mobile games. Meanwhile, tabletop gamers chose to stick with their physical games. It also didn't help that Sunderfolk launched on April 23, the same week The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. As players had two fantastic RPGs, capitalizing on nostalgia to choose from, something as experimental as Sunderfolk didn't capture players' attention like those titles did. This game is at its best when multiple people are convinced to play it over an extended period of time. The time and interest buy-in required, and the release timing, just didn't work in Sunderfolk's favor. That makes a quiet late December for new game releases the perfect time to release it. To Secret Door and Dreamhaven's credit, they also haven't abandoned the game. Its app is still operational, and a free trial for those curious but not convinced is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. A post-launch update added the ability to do one-shot missions rather than a whole campaign, while an update next year is set to add a new playable character, more missions, and even the ability to play the game with mouse and keyboard rather than a phone. That support gives me the confidence to recommend Sunderfolk at its current 40% discount. If you missed out on Sunderfolk around the time it was released, it's worth picking up now that it's just $30 during the Steam Winter Sale. For those who are still skeptical of using a phone as a controller, I recommend trying the free trial first; you'll come away impressed. You could also wait to play it until keyboard and mouse controls are added next year, but still buy it at a discount now. So many games fall through the cracks of the gaming zeitgeist every year, and Sunderfolk is one that deserves another chance. While throwback RPGs are comfort food, something like Sunderfolk is innovating the ways that keep the genre interesting. Phone interesting may not catch on outside of Netflix or Amazon Luna's casual games, but some other game design ideas from this game can live on in future RPGs. $30 is more than worth it if you want to play a game that's trying something new and not just iterating on the same old concepts.

Title: A major overhaul of League of Legends is reportedly coming in 2027: 'Once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League'

Riot has big plans for attracting new players to its aging MOBA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new Bloomberg report says Riot Games is currently working on an update to League of Legends, known internally as League Next, that will be the biggest in the game's history. The overhaul of League's "visual aesthetic," as Bloomberg put it, will impact characters, battle arenas, and the interface, and is aimed at making the game more welcoming for new players. League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in. The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios. The games that emerged from that program, including Ruined King, Mageseeker, Bandle Tale, Song of Nunu, and Convergence, were generally well received but failed to attract significant audiences. Another round of layoffs at Riot followed in October, as Riot co-founder Marc Merrill indicated that the studio was looking back to its foundational MOBA for future success. "This isn't about reducing headcount to save money," Merrill said at the time. "It's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond. While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League." After the Bloomberg report went out, Riot posted a video that didn't exactly deny what was in it. Pointedly entitled "A look at some of our plans for League after 2026," the video has executive producer Paul "Pabro" Bellezza and head of studio Andrei "Meddler" van Roon acknowledging that the studio has "been working on some bigger updates to League." A look at some of our plans for League after 2026. pic.twitter.com/vqsnBksg1YDecember 18, 2025 "For starters, we're making a brand-new around-game client that's fully integrated with the in-game experience, rather than being a separate application like today," van Roon says. Bellezza then jumps in to say, "We're also revamping Summoner's Rift with entirely new visuals, and a bit of new gameplay," and then adds, pointedly, that Riot is "overhauling the new player experience, so that once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It definitely isn't a comprehensive look at what's coming in some post-2026 timeframe, but it does sound very much like it will be very big indeed. Whether it succeeds in attracting new players to League, or merely annoys the existing old-timers, is an entirely separate question, and the irony is that Riot's co-domination of the MOBA space, alongside Valve's Dota 2, has made life extremely difficult for newcomers. Supervive, developed by a team of Riot veterans and released just five months ago, announced earlier this week that it will close down in February; Seekers of Skyveil had an even shorter lifespan, Gigantic: Rampage Edition has literally zero players on Steam, and Amazon recently opted to sell March of Giants to Ubisoft rather than release it. League of Legends may be aging out, but whether there's an appetite for some kind of 'League 2.0' remains to be seen. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Games industry layoff figures were down slightly in 2025 – but it was still horrendous | Year in Review

Although layoffs were down by around a third, studios in the US and Western Europe may have been hit by the trend for jobs moving to emerging markets Conditions remain tough in the games industry, and layoff figures were still high in 2025, although down from their peak in 2024. Amir Satvat, business development director at Tencent Games, maintains a widely used resource for helping people find jobs in the games industry, and for the past few years he has been tracking and forecasting layoff numbers. Crucially, he attempts to include layoffs that were not publicly reported, as well as using his community connections to find out actual figures for layoffs when companies report them without listing the numbers of people affected. At the time of writing, Satvat has settled on a figure of 9,175 games industry layoffs in 2025, just shy of the prediction of 9,769 he made back in January. That's dramatically down on the estimated 15,631 layoffs in 2024, although still higher than the estimated 8,500 layoffs in 2022, when the current games industry crisis kicked in. Satvat predicts that we'll see another 7,500 layoffs in 2026, pointing towards a slow recovery in the industry. However, he thinks that the share of open roles in North America and Western Europe will continue to decrease. Earlier this year, he told The Games Business that "over 70%, and in some years 75%, of the layoffs have been in North America," with AAA studios being particularly affected, and with more than 50% of cuts taking place in California. Similarly, a survey released in October found more than 26% of European game professionals were laid off in the past year, with median salaries dropping dramatically compared with 2024. "Salaries for programmers – especially Unity developers – have dropped by almost half, mainly because there are barely any open positions," said Tanja Loktionova, founder of Values Value and co-founder of InGame Job, the companies behind the survey. "There have been a lot of layoffs and very few new opportunities." Satvat predicts that whereas job opportunities will decrease in Western Europe and North America, they will increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. That tallies with comments made during this year's GamesIndustry.biz Investment Panel by Lirui Ding, principal at the gaming venture capital firm Transcend Fund, about the games industry's ongoing geographical shift. "We're really seeing a lot of money actually going from the US and Europe to other emerging markets," he explained, "whether it's China, Turkey, or even Vietnam." Chris Petrovic, chief business officer and board chairman at the developer and publisher FunPlus, made similar comments in a GamesIndustry.biz feature in December, where he predicted that the industry would grow, but in different areas of the globe. "Previously, we talked a lot about gaming innovation, creativity, and commercial success coming from places like the United States, Canada, Germany, and Finland," he said, "and now we are increasingly talking about emerging game dev hubs like China, Turkey, Israel, and Vietnam." 2025 saw a number of studio closures, including Toadman Interactive, Freejam, nDreams Studio Orbital and nDreams Studio, Thunderful-owned Studio Fizbin, Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop Studios, Zynga-owned Echtra Games, Dundee-based Cobra Mobile, Microsoft-owned The Initiative, Avalanche Studios Group's Liverpool studio, Ubisoft Leamington, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, Fantastic Pixel Castle, Bad Brain Game Studios, and three Warner Bros. Games studios: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. Reports also alleged that Ballistic Moon, the UK-based developer of the Until Dawn remake, was "effectively closed" after almost all its staff were laid off, while Aheartfulofgames, the Spanish studio behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, said it faced closure after owner Outright Games signalled its intention to make all employees at the studio redundant. In addition, the UK-based studios Three Fields Entertainment and Splash Damage both began redundancy consultations affecting all employees. Dozens of studios cut staff numbers in 2025, including: In terms of the biggest gaming companies, Tencent Games made a number of cuts and divestments at its European studios. In February, the Tencent-owned Sumo Group announced it would be refocusing "exclusively on development services for partners," which would "have an impact on our studios and people." It sold off publisher Secret Mode in March. In June, Sumo-owned studio The Chinese Room made a small number of layoffs before revealing it would be going independent. In January, Splash Damage – which was bought by Tencent in 2020 – said jobs were at risk following the cancellation of Transformers: Reactivate. In September, the studio said it had been acquired by private-equity investors, then in November the entire studio was placed in consultation ahead of redundancies. In October, Oslo-based Funcom, which is owned by Tencent and is behind the open-world survival game Dune: Awakening, said it would be making job cuts as part of a restructuring. And in November, Tencent-owned studio Sharkmob, which is working on the sci-fi extraction shooter Exoborne, said it was making job cuts at its Malmo studio. NetEase studio Jar of Sparks said in January that it would be looking for a new publishing partner after NetEase pulled its funding. "As we prepare for this next step, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities," said founder and CEO Jerry Hook. Then in February, the NetEase-backed studio Liquid Swords, which was established by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios, reported a round of job cuts. A few days later, NetEase confirmed layoffs at a US support studio for Marvel Rivals, hours before revealing the game had 40 million players. NetEase also shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment (which was later resurrected by a "small group of veteran directors and founders"), divested Fantastic Pixel Castle (which subsequently closed), and pulled out of Bad Brain Game Studios, a studio it had set up in 2023, which closed after it failed to find a new publisher. Microsoft made some major job cuts in 2025. After a relatively small round of layoffs in January, the firm announced a 3% cut to its staff in May. But the biggest round of job cuts came in July, affecting an estimated 9,000 people, or around 4% of Microsoft's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in Microsoft's games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Microsoft's console rival Sony made cuts too, laying off staff at the PlayStation support studio Visual Arts and PS Studios Malaysia, as well as initiating redundancies at Days Gone maker Bend Studio. Unity implemented another round of cuts in February, following around 1,800 job losses in January 2024, and Amazon announced an enormous 14,000 layoffs in October, which resulted in work ceasing on the MMO New World. Intel, meanwhile, announced layoffs in April and July as part of cost-cutting measures. Meta laid off a number of people in 2025, cutting 5% of staff in January, and then making further cuts to the Reality Labs division in April. But there could be bigger cuts to come, after Bloomberg reported that Meta is allegedly planning to slash budgets in its Reality Labs division by as much as 30% in 2026. Netflix-owned Night School Studio cut an undisclosed number of staff in February, and Krafton-owned Striking Distance Studios – which was behind The Callisto Protocol – made layoffs in March. Square Enix, meanwhile, implemented a "fundamental restructuring" in November, pulling resources away from "overseas" development studios and putting over 100 jobs at risk. Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics cut staff in March, August, and November, before unveiling Tomb Raider: Catalyst at the Game Awards in December, which is being published by Amazon. In addition, the Embracer studio Eidos Montreal, which was behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, was allegedly hit with layoffs in December, following an earlier round of cuts in March. In February, Warner Bros. Games announced it was shuttering Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros San Diego, as well as cancelling its upcoming Wonder Woman game. Monolith had been operating for over 30 years, and was behind games such as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Player First Games was behind the brawler MultiVersus, and Warner acquired the studio in July 2024 before cancelling the game in January 2025. Ubisoft made numerous job cuts in 2025. In January, it made redundancies at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections, and announced the closure of Ubisoft Leamington. Then in July, it announced 19 layoffs at the Tom Clancy: Ghost Recon studio Red Storm, followed by nine job losses in the publishing team in September. Finally, in October, it unveiled a "restructuring proposal" for the Finland-based RedLynx studio that could affect up to 60 positions, shortly before announcing plans to offer voluntary redundancies to staff at its Swedish subsidiary Massive Entertainment. EA also cut a number of jobs this year, beginning with the EA studio Respawn cancelling two "early-stage" incubation projects and cutting developers from its Apex Legends and Star Wars: Jedi teams, resulting in approximately 100 layoffs. On the same day, EA announced a further 200 job losses, chiefly affecting EA's Experiences team. A day later, EA said it was "pausing development" of the World Rally Championship series, leading to layoffs at Codemasters. Finally, there were a number of cuts at studios owned by Take-Two Interactive. 2K Games confirmed in August that it had "reduced the size of the development team" working on BioShock 4, which is being developed by the Californian studio Cloud Chamber. Then in September, 2K confirmed a "reduction" in the headcount at Civilization and XCOM developer Firaxis. But most controversially, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Take-Two-owned Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. This article has been updated to add the various Warner Bros.

December 19, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While much of the public narrative around the technology sector has focused on layoffs and workforce reductions, industry analysts point to a parallel and more consequential shift unfolding beneath the headlines. One organization addressing the growing gap between AI talent demand and available expertise is Interview Kickstart, whose Advanced Machine Learning Course is designed to help professionals build production-ready AI skills aligned with hiring expectations at large technology companies. Major technology companies are concentrating resources around artificial intelligence engineering at an unprecedented scale, signaling a structural transformation in how technical talent is hired, organized, and valued across the industry. The multi-month program spans core programming fundamentals through advanced machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and deployment practices, with instruction led by engineers from FAANG and other Tier-1 firms. More information about the course is available at https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course#interview-preparation. Public workforce data and industry research indicate that AI engineering teams at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Meta have expanded significantly over the past several years, even as broader headcount reductions occurred elsewhere. By late 2024, these firms collectively employed tens of thousands of engineers in roles dedicated to machine learning, generative AI, data infrastructure, and applied AI systems. Analysts note that this concentration of AI expertise has few historical precedents in the technology sector. This expansion reflects deliberate strategic repositioning rather than reactive hiring. In the years leading up to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools, large technology firms increased investment in AI talent, computing infrastructure, and internal research capacity. Hiring trends from 2019 through 2024 show sustained growth in specialized AI roles, suggesting that companies were anticipating changes in how products and services would be built and delivered. Notably, this hiring momentum continued even during periods of broader workforce contraction. While companies reduced staffing in areas such as marketing, operations, and general administration, AI engineering teams were largely protected and, in some cases, expanded. Industry observers interpret this as a clear signal that AI-related roles are viewed as central to long-term competitiveness rather than discretionary investments. The resulting labor market has become increasingly segmented. Professionals with experience building and deploying AI systems at scale are in high demand, while roles centered on routine implementation or narrowly scoped tasks face growing automation pressure. Recruiters report that AI engineering positions often require experience beyond theoretical knowledge, including hands-on work with large language models, data pipelines, distributed systems, and production deployment. This demand has outpaced supply. Despite sustained hiring efforts, many organizations report difficulty filling AI engineering roles due to a shortage of candidates with relevant, production-level experience. As a result, qualified professionals are often able to choose among multiple opportunities, particularly at organizations with significant AI infrastructure and research investments. However, industry analysts emphasize that access to these roles depends on depth of expertise. Companies are not simply seeking familiarity with AI concepts; they are evaluating candidates on their ability to design, implement, and maintain complex systems under real-world constraints. This includes considerations such as scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and responsible deployment. The distinction between conceptual understanding and applied expertise has become increasingly important. Professionals who have built and operated AI systems in production environments are better positioned to meet hiring criteria than those whose exposure is limited to coursework or isolated experiments. This has led many engineers and data professionals to pursue structured upskilling as a way to bridge the gap. Interview Kickstart's Advanced Machine Learning Course is structured around this industry reality. The program emphasizes applied learning through live instruction, hands-on projects, and capstone work modeled on real business scenarios across sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare, cybersecurity, and financial technology. According to the company, the curriculum is regularly updated to reflect emerging requirements, including agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, scalable model deployment, and machine learning operations. In addition to technical training, the program integrates interview preparation and career coaching. Participants engage in mock interviews with instructors who have experience hiring for AI and ML roles, along with resume and behavioral coaching designed to reflect evaluation standards at large technology firms. This combination aims to align skill development with real-world hiring processes. Industry observers note that as AI adoption accelerates, the need for professionals who can translate AI capabilities into reliable products and systems will continue to grow. Structured programs that combine technical depth with practical application may play an increasingly important role in preparing professionals for this evolving landscape.

Title: New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others

Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:22:01Z
Full Content:
The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 85,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in. This fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out. The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments on the rule and preparing the final text. Three months after President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B workers, Business Insider has assessed what's changed, who is benefiting, and who is getting hurt. Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one. Suddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company. The Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been "deliberately exploited" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts. In a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to "root out fraud." "The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended," Tragesser said. Meanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules. A State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis. Immigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies. The fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots. Large enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms. Justin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success. The wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery. "Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission," said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups "may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system." One exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high. Under the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal. New grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all. Alcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules. On paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said. The Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent. The tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding. Immigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance. Domestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches. "One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing," said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. "Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday." Correction: December 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of H-1B visas approved annually. The cap is 85,000 visas. Jump to

Title: How Amazon's 8.5% layoff in Luxembourg raises difficult questions for Indian foreign workers

When Amazon announced 14,000 cuts globally earlier this week, a number of these were from its tech unit in Luxembourg. Bloomberg reported that the retail giant is culling 8.5% or 370 of its 4,370 employees in the tiny European nation, its largest such job cuts here in around 20 years. The Amazon layoffs could also pose an impossible situation for Indian and other foreign workers in Luxembourg, who are likely to be among those affected. The redundancies are “adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies,” Amazon said in a memo to staff on 12 December, adding that the severance package “goes well beyond industry benchmarks”. The Luxembourg Labor Minister’s office didn’t return a request for comment on the layoffs. The Duchy of Luxembourg has employees from the United States, Australia, Egypt, India, and Tunisia working at Amazon. If any of these staff are among those fired, they will have to find another job within three months or return home. Speaking to Bloomberg, Prash Chandrasekhar, a member of the Amazon employee delegation, said some employees may have to leave the country. “I am almost sure some employees will have to leave. It’s not easy to find a job in Luxembourg, for 370 people entering the job market at the same time,” he said. Chandrasekhar added that for those seeking work in big tech in particular, there is no real alternative to Amazon. Notably, to fire employees in the European Union (EU), companies must hold negotiations with employee representatives and sometimes the government. After two weeks of such discussions, Amazon reduced its job cuts in Luxembourg from 470 to 370, Bloomberg added. Amazon will notify a number of the affected employees of their termination in February, Chandrasekhar said. The report added that Amazon's layoffs in the 680,000-population country could trigger some “speed bumps” in the so far mutually beneficial relationship between the tech giant and tax haven nation. Luxembourg is known as a tax haven and financial centre with relatively high wages and low-income taxes, which have benefited many foreign companies. Amazon has since 2003 steadily expanded in the country and even after the layoffs will be Luxembourg’s fifth-largest employer. An employee told Bloomberg anonymously that most of the cuts are expected to be among software developers as artificial intelligence (AI) use grows, and to “trim” the workforce hired during the pandemic-era boom. The General Luxembourg Workers’ Organization (OGBL) union and other unions allege that Amazon has been granted “outsized” tax benefits in Luxembourg. The BB report said that Amazon and other foreign companies have set up holding companies in Luxembourg, through which they funnel European operations. It added that Amazon uses accounting rules deemed legal by European courts in 2023 to routinely declare losses on its continental operations and minimise tax burden. Last year, according to public records, the Luxembourg-based holding company Amazon EU Sarl reported €70.4 billion ($82.8 billion) in EU e-commerce sales and almost the same amount of expenses, including employee costs, leaving the company with a tax on profit of just €180 million. In November, Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden met Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in Seattle, and later stressed in a LinkedIn post that the company remains a “vital partner” for Luxembourg. In a comment under the post, Jassy replied, “Luxembourg’s been an important home for Amazon and our 4,000 teammates there. Appreciated the discussion and partnership.” (With inputs from Bloomberg) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
