When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies. Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.) The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed. Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts. AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned "to have high impact and help us reinvent the company." Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be "fleeting" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years. "We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade," they wrote. "Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."

Title: NBCU's one-size-fits-all severance package for RTO workers shows just how much power employers have right now
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/workplace-severance-offer-rto-mandate-worker-loyalty-nbcu-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-12T17:56:56Z
Full Content:
The standard, tenure-based severance package is being put to the test. NBCUniversal is offering separation pay that isn't tied to employees' number of years on the job, an atypical move that some leadership experts say risks denting worker loyalty in the long term. The media giant told employees this week that if they don't want to comply with a new return-to-office mandate, they can leave and take a severance package comprising eight weeks of base salary, Business Insider first reported. The financial part of the arrangement is unusual, experts say, because severance packages are normally aligned with employees' length of service. An NBCU spokesperson previously declined to comment on internal communications and policies and didn't respond to a request for comment for this story. If other companies follow NBCU's example, workers may become less inclined to stay with any one employer for more than a few years, cautioned Raj Namboothiry, head of staffing firm Manpower's US division. That's because a potential future severance package would exclude the kind of safety net they could count on with a traditional package, he said. Since standard packages are tied to tenure, the longer an employee stays with a company, the bigger the payout they would receive. To be sure, NBCU is providing its eight-week pay-for-all packages on a voluntary basis. Companies including Amazon issued RTO mandates without granting any severance pay to workers who choose not to comply. Extending fixed payouts after more general layoffs would be dicier as far as loyalty goes, said Namboothiry, since workers would have no choice in the matter. These days, fixed severance packages after either layoffs or RTO mandates may not pose a problem for most leaders since job opportunities are scarce, said Nicole Kyle, cofounder of CMP Research, a research and advisory firm focused on the future of work. More people are currently unemployed and actively looking for work than there are job opportunities, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Employers have the leverage right now," Kyle said. But should the tables turn down the line, fixed packages may discourage people from seeking jobs at firms with a reputation for offering them in lieu of the standard tenure-based kind, Kyle added. "The labor market is going to remember," she said. There is some precedent to companies offering fixed payouts as part of voluntary separation agreements, but it is rare. In late 2021, online mortgage startup Better abruptly laid off about 900 employees and provided them with 60 days of severance pay, regardless of tenure. A more high-profile example occurred about five months after Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022. The billionaire sent the social-media company's employees an email instructing them to fill out a form asking if they wanted to remain at the company and be part of an "extremely hardcore" culture, Business Insider reported at the time. Employees who didn't opt to stay would be given three months of severance, Musk said in the email. Many Twitter employees took the deal. NBCU's package is available to US and UK staffers at the vice-president level and below. They must accept it by October 3 and stay through the end of 2025. By giving nearly four months' notice, NBCU is letting its work-from-home aficionados get a big jump-start on their job search in a tough market, said Anna Tavis, New York University's department chair of human capital management. While eight weeks of pay isn't a large sum for those at the VP level, Tavis said it could be an enticing offer for lower-level employees, which she believes may be NBCU's intention. It also might be more enticing for newer employees, said Kyle. Offering the same number of weeks' worth of severance pay for all departing staffers would likely appeal less to longterm employees who'd be eligible to receive far more money with a tenure-based package, she said. Employers looking to trim their workforces may be using return-to-office orders as an alternative to layoffs, expecting some employees to quit rather than comply, as Business Insider has reported. Tavis said that the approach is "less painful and more humane" than mass cuts. Still, the move poses risks, she added, as companies could see top talent walk out the door and land a job at a competitor that allows remote or more hybrid work. "You often first lose the people who have other options," Tavis said. Jump to

Title: Why Does David Ellison Want Paramount to Swallow Warner Bros. Discovery Whole? To Beat Rival Suitors to the Punch

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor David Ellison‘s Skydance Media just completed the $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global five weeks ago. Now, before Ellison and his team have even finished the work of laying off upwards of 2,000 employees at the newly merged Paramount Skydance to slash costs, the son of tech multibillionaire Larry Ellison is mulling what would currently be a $70 billion-plus deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. The question is: Why now? Popular on Variety Related Stories Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst Electrify Toronto Film Festival With True Crime Drama 'Roofman' ‘I Swear’ Review: Down-to-Earth Tourette Syndrome Drama Is a Fine Showcase for 'Rings of Power' Star Robert Aramayo Wouldn’t it make more sense to wait until WBD splits in half — to form Warner Bros. (HBO Max and studios) and Discovery Global (TV networks) — a transaction CEO David Zaslav says is on track to be done in April 2026? The WBD separation is designed to boost the value of its streaming and studios businesses by carving off the declining TV arm. Paramount Skydance could make a play for the standalone Warner Bros. without assuming the baggage (including the lion’s share of WBD debt) of the entity that will house CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery and other nets. And through a deal for standalone Warner Bros., Paramount Skydance would still get its hands on the key growth driver going forward: HBO Max. (The mind reels at what a fused HBO Max-Paramount+ might be rebranded.) One possibility is that a Larry Ellison-backed M&A play for WBD has been part of the Skydance strategy all along. The idea would be “to consolidate media assets during a period of industry-wide instability and build a conglomerate with a streaming-first focus wrapped with TV and film studios and potentially a larger linear television portfolio,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a research note Thursday. And the advantage of moving now is that it could “preempt a potential bidding war for only the Warner Bros. Streaming & Studios assets post-split,” Fishman noted. “By acting now, [Paramount Skydance] positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets.” Indeed, prior to news of Paramount Skydance’s prepping a bid for WBD, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Wells Fargo media analyst Steven Cahall issued a note that pegged the future standalone Warner Bros. as “an attractive M&A candidate” — with Netflix “the most compelling buyer,” and other potential suitors including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Sony and Paramount Skydance. Regarding the separated Warner Bros. streaming and studios biz, Cahall wrote, “This will be the only large IP asset for sale at a time when most studios/streamers have big aspirations.” The analyst acknowledged that Netflix has not historically made any big M&A deals. But he opined a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. had a number of benefits, including being able to “kickstart” a theatrical strategy for the streamer, help it scale video games and “most importantly [provide] premium content to members.” Cahall calculated the value of standalone Warner Bros. at around $65 billion. To be sure, any Paramount Skydance offer for Warner Bros. Discovery would face big financial and regulatory obstacles — arguably much greater than Skydance-Paramount merger. After Warner Bros. Discovery shares zoomed up 29% on the potential Paramount bid, WBD now has a market value of $40 billion. When adding in debt (minus cash and equivalents), the enterprise value of Warner Bros. Discovery is now about $71 billion. And that is a far bigger price than the Ellisons paid to swing Skydance-Paramount. “We think the high debt leverage of WBD is an impediment to a high bid for WBD’s shares,” Kenneth Leon, director of industry and equity research at CFRA Research, said in a Sept. 11 note. He suggested that, even if Paramount Skydance wins a deal for Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole, it may “be only interested in the businesses that will become Warner Bros. and not see meaningful value creation from the Discovery Global media portfolio.” But MoffettNathanson’s Fishman speculated that Paramount Skydance could see big benefits by pooling its TV business with WBD’s. “Overall, we would expect material cost synergies from the overlapping cable networks,” he wrote — i.e., layoffs. Fishman added there there are “presumably a high level of synergies from combining CBS News with CNN plus the long-term existing partnership between CBS and Turner with the NCAA’s March Madness Final Four.” Then there’s the question of whether a Paramount-WBD tie-up could get regulatory approval, as it represents a more horizontal combination of two media giants than Skydance-Paramount. Skydance was largely a production company, with limited overlap with Paramount Global. Already coming out against the notion of a combined Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who wrote in a post on X Thursday that such a media merger “must be blocked as a dangerous concentration of power.” The Trump administration OK’d the Skydance-Paramount merger, after Skydance made key concessions to the FCC including hiring a CBS News ombudsman to vet complaints of “bias” and promising to never bring back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the company. But Warren and others have alleged Paramount Global’s $16 million payment to Trump to settle his lawsuit (alleging CBS News’ “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with then-VP Kamala Harris) was a “bribe” to get Trump’s blessing on their deal while Warren also called out Trump’s claim that the new owners of Paramount promised $20 million worth of free advertising. “Remember when Trump announced a multimillion-dollar secret deal with CEO David Ellison? And then — shocker — Trump approved Ellison buying CBS/Paramount,” Warren wrote in the post. “Now, Ellison wants to take over CNN/Warner Bros.” (Skydance and Paramount said they complied with all U.S. laws throughout the merger process, including antibribery laws.) Whatever scenario ultimately unfolds, Zaslav for one seemingly will see his wish for media biz consolidation realized. After Trump was elected to a second term in November 2024, Zaslav expressed optimism the new administration would facilitate industry M&A. Trump 2.0, Zaslav said, “may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different” and that it may “provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that’s needed.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why a Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery Merger Makes Sense | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The ink is barely dry on the $8 billion Skydance merger and the Ellisons may already be eyeing their next target Fresh off its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount appears ready to pounce on Warner Bros. Discovery in a bid to merge its way to becoming a next-generation media giant. Paramount’s new CEO David Ellison is reportedly preparing a majority cash bid for all of WBD’s assets, including its cable networks and movie studio. According to the Wall Street Journal, it would be backed by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — David’s father and newly-crowned as the world’s richest man. Warner stock closed up nearly 30% at the end of Thursday’s trading session, while Paramount was up more than 5%, with both companies hitting new 52-week highs of $17.24 and $87.89 per share, respectively. Representatives for Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment. A potential deal would give the diminished Paramount and Warner Discovery much-needed scale and an increased arsenal of content at a time where they’ve lagged behind Netflix and Disney in the streaming wars. Combined the new company would have a total of 203.4 million streaming subscribers as of the latest figures from the second quarter of 2025 — putting it just shy of Disney’s 207.4 million across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ in its latest quarter. Reaching numbers to be competitive with Disney and Netflix has been a long-stated aim of Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Paramount would also be able to tap Warner’s massive portfolio of assets, including Warner Bros. Television and Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Discovery+, a slew of cable networks and other media businesses, including production studios in Burbank, California, and Leavesden, England. They would be paired with Paramount assets including the CBS network, Paramount Pictures and its studio, along with streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV and cable networks like Comedy Central, MTV, BET and Nickelodeon. Additionally, the companies would have stronger bargaining power with advertisers, distributors and talent and the opportunity to generate massive cost savings. Paramount has already identified more than $2 billion in merger-related cuts that will be carried out through layoffs, a review of its real estate portfolio and a transformation of its technological infrastructure. Wolfe Research’s Peter Supino estimates that a combined Paramount-WBD could generate $3 billion in cost synergies, including roughly $1.5 billion from streaming & studios, $1.2 billion from Warner Bros. corporate costs and roughly $250 million from linear networks. “It’s a brilliant move,” Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of the Los Angeles-based investment firm Greif & Co., told TheWrap. “Everybody knows Larry Ellison has the ability to pull it off. So let there be no doubt, this is a doable deal, even though Paramount is a minnow and Warner is a whale. I don’t think anybody on the street has any doubts that they can complete this transaction.” Merging the two media companies together would catapult David Ellison further into the upper strata of power players in the entertainment world, one he had just entered through Skydance’s merger with Paramount. It would also expand the influence of the Ellison family in the media and tech space. In addition to WBD, the younger Ellison has been circling Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. President Donald Trump has also previously expressed support for the elder Ellison’s Oracle to buy TikTok. “For the Ellisons, pulling this off would crown their effort to build a next-gen Hollywood major,” Qualia Legacy Advisors managing director Aaron Meyerson said. “For David Zaslav, it could provide a strategic exit after years of cost-cutting and debt management.” That said, Hollywood insiders bemoaned the prospect of losing yet another major studio. “You have 20 percent fewer people to sell to. Finding the next Jordan Peele, the next Daniels [Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert] — the threshold gets harder and harder,” said one top executive from a rival studio. “And does it become a free for all? Does Apple try to buy Universal?” the executive continued, suggesting that the sparse details from Thursday’s leak suggests a trial balloon rather than a serious bid. “If I were looking to do R&D and test the market, today was very successful,” this person said. Even if a deal goes through, Howard Homonoff, a strategic advisor to media and tech companies and managing director of Homonoff Media Group, told TheWrap that many important strategic questions remain unanswered. For one, the combined company could be exposed to too many cable networks at a time when that business is in decline. It’s also unclear if combining Paramount+ and HBO Max would be enough to close the gap with streaming heavy-hitter Netflix. “It’s a bigger player, but it still leaves a lot of questions for future investors about what the growth strategy is,” Homonoff said. Still, the chance to increase the reach and scale of the companies may be worth the risk. Ellison’s move comes as the Zaslav-led media giant has been working towards a split of its linear network (Discovery Global) and studios and streaming businesses (Warner Bros.) by mid-2026. MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said that getting a bid early could preempt a potential bidding war for WBD’s streaming and studio assets post-split. “By acting now, Paramount positions itself to secure the entire company before rivals can cherry-pick the most attractive assets,” Fishman wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. “Perhaps just as important, the odds of the deal clearing regulatory review may be higher for the Skydance team given its recent success in closing the Paramount transaction.” Among the potential rival bidders that Fishman floated include Comcast, which is currently in the process of its own spin off of network assets with Versant, and Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which previously kicked the tires on Paramount prior to Ellison’s acquisition. Representatives for Comcast, Apollo and Sony did not immediately return TheWrap’s request for comment. Greif also didn’t rule out the possibility of a big tech player like Apple, Amazon, Google or other private equity firms entering the ring. “Warner Brothers is an extremely attractive asset. I think everybody pays attention to this one and doesn’t let it go,” Greif said. “Splitting would have definitely attracted a feeding frenzy. This move is trying to catch everybody flat footed, but you can’t really catch anybody flat footed for long. They’re all going to think long and hard about getting into a bidding war with Larry Ellison.” While a deal is doable, there will obviously be key challenges for Ellison to overcome if he ultimately makes a bid. Among the challenges are WBD’s massive $35.6 billion in gross debt to pay down on top of Paramount’s own $15.5 billion. Experts also aren’t ruling out potential antitrust, regulatory or political scrutiny from the Trump administration and other lawmakers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already knocked a potential tie-up as a “dangerous concentration of power” and warned it “must be blocked.” “Regulators would scrutinize overlaps in broadcast (CBS), cable news (CNN), sports rights and streaming under the (Department of Justice)’s tougher merger guidelines and to a lesser extent the FCC,” Meyerson said. “It’s a bold swing with real industrial logic, but the political and financial execution risks are equally large.” Any deal, however, would likely be supported by the deep-pockets of the elder Ellison, whose net worth sits at $367.2 billion. And given Paramount’s $7.7 billion bid to acquire the rights to UFC, the Ellisons have shown they’re willing to spare no expense if it gives them a competitive advantage. On the regulatory front, the Ellisons have already done a lot of work to gain favor with Trump, who could ease any regulatory concerns. There’s also the question of whether Zaslav is ready to hand over the reins or not, though this isn’t the first time a merger with Paramount has been mulled. Ultimately, if the offer is rich enough, it may not be up to him. “There will be pressure on him to act in the interest of the shareholders,” Greif said. “If the deal is deemed to be an attractive price, it’s a deal that gets done whether Zaslav has a position post-closing, or whether he just smiles all the way into happy temporary retirement. And it would be temporary retirement. Guys like that don’t stay on the sidelines for long.” Sharon Waxman contributed reporting to this story.

Title: The Highest-Paid TV Hosts Of 2025

ByMatt Craig, Forbes Staff. Nowhere is the structural decline of linear television more on full display than in late night. For decades, the shows were reliable cash cows for the networks, but in recent years analysts estimate that none turn a profit. Then, in July, CBS made the abrupt decision to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing $40 million in losses per year. And both ABC and NBC trimmed budgets last fall by moving to four-nights-per-week, whether their hosts wanted to or not. “I was bummed,” Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon tells Forbes. “I want to do it five days a week. I love doing it.” Still, a late-night talk show gig comes with a salary that places Fallon ($16 million), Jimmy Kimmel ($16 million) and Stephen Colbert ($15 million) among the highest-paid hosts on television, according to Forbes estimates. Even in its diminished state, linear television still generates significant revenue for networks, and it’s the talent from categories like late-night, morning shows, primetime news, sports and lifestyle who remain TV’s biggest stars. Combined, the top 25 hosts earn an estimated $582 million. With few exceptions, they make far more money than the stars of TV’s hit scripted shows. But with late-night extinction seemingly on the horizon, many have begun questioning whether hosts like Fallon will be the last to lead their respective programs—even one as long-running and venerable as The Tonight Show, which NBC has aired since 1954. “Oh gosh,” Fallon says, while contemplating whether he will be Tonight’s last host. “No, there'll be someone else. And I don't think it'll be a robot. I think it has to be a human being that makes mistakes and has a real conversation with people.” At the very least, it’s almost certain that this generation of TV stars will be the last mega-earners the medium ever produces. Most in the top 25 hosts have been in the spotlight for decades, and across the board, agents and managers report a strong downward pressure on compensation during contract renewal negotiations. Often the best that top talent can hope for is to maintain their salary from past years, and in many cases networks require work on additional shows or projects to justify staying at the same level financially. For example, in addition to late-night, Fallon and Kimmel now host game shows for their respective networks. Elsewhere, celebrity chefs are still living extra-large. Guy Fieri ($33 million), Bobby Flay ($33 million) and Gordon Ramsay ($33 million) each oversee a small universe of shows, and have earned overall production deals similar to those given to top scripted TV showrunners, trading profit participation for guaranteed annual fees. The details of these deals are usually closely guarded secrets. When one leaks out, like Fieri’s three-year, $100 million deal with the Food Network in late 2023, it can cause a correction in the market as competitors demand the same compensation—as was the case for Flay and Ramsay. And large contracts make for bad optics when networks have layoffs. Disney, for example, cut nearly 200 jobs from its ABC News and Disney Entertainment Networks divisions in March, just a few months after renewing Good Morning America’s George Stephanopolous for an estimated $17 million annually. The exception to this trend is sports, where salaries have risen sharply in recent years and new talent has had the opportunity to break-in. Sports broadcasters and studio personalities account for eight of the top 25 this year, including seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, who, as a Fox football analyst, tops the list at $37.5 million annually. In the not-too-distant past, the idea that sports broadcasters could make more money than the athletes they talk about would have been ludicrous. But with media companies shelling out billions for league rights, and those games becoming by far the most-watched events on television, paying a few million more for premium talent is seen both as an insurance policy for content quality and also an incentive for leagues to steer their best games to the network. The 48-year-old Brady was hired, for example, to bring star power to Fox’s NFL broadcasts after Troy Aikman ($18 million) and Joe Buck ($16 million) were lured away to call ESPN’s biggest football games. “As sports becomes a differentiator, and as sports rights become more precious and expensive, given both the attention and the number of entities negotiating for them, that certainly causes other content formats and money to be pushed out,” says Neal Zuckerman, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. “There's only so much you can spend on content in order to make a reasonably profitable business.” Another bright spot on the list is the number of women who are represented. Three hosts —Judy Sheindlen ($30 million), Rachel Maddow and Robin Roberts (both at $25 million)—are among the 10 highest-paid personalities on TV, while two more, Savannah Guthrie ($24 million) and Kelly Ripa ($22 million), rank among the top 15. But those outsize paydays will soon come to an end. Streaming platforms do not offer talent salaries comparable to the largest TV deals. Instead, platforms like YouTube share 55% of ad revenue with creators, incentivizing talent to bet on themselves. When the model works, it gives hosts bargaining power, as is the case with Pat McAfee ($20 million), who maintains ownership and editorial control of his daily talk show while licensing it to ESPN for a hefty fee (a portion of those earnings go toward paying his staff and production costs). Many in the industry believe there will be more deals like his in the future. In the meantime, here are the hosts commanding the most. Television insiders say the true value of Fox's Hail Mary deal to land the seven-time Super Bowl champion after his retirement from football in 2022 is impossible to calculate, since some of his compensation is in company stock (the price of which has risen significantly since Brady signed). In addition to his duties in the commentary booth, which began last fall to mixed reviews, Brady serves as a Fox ambassador in a number of company functions, which are used to justify the enormous compensation package. The mayor of Flavortown reset the market for lifestyle talent with his three-year, $100 million overall deal signed in late 2023, making him the highest-paid talent at the Food Network after it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery a year earlier. The 57-year-old restauranteur has made nearly 600 episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives since it debuted in 2007, and he produces or appears in numerous programs across the WBD portfolio. Overall deals like Flay’s, which was renewed in November to match Fieri's annual total, charges every talent, producing and personal appearance fee, and in some cases even cuts of ancillary businesses like physical products and restaurants, against a set annual total. To make the deal worth it, the 60-year-old chef will have to stay busy, with Bobby’s Triple Threat debuting earlier this month and two other shows, Beat Bobby Flay and BBQ Brawl, currently in production. Much like the other top chefs on TV, Ramsay has set up a mini-universe of culinary shows for Fox, including Hell’s Kitchen, MasterChef, and Next Level Chef, enough to land the same top-of-market overall deal value in March. Yet unlike Bobby Flay and Guy Fieri, the 58-year-old Ramsay currently holds eight Michelin stars in his restaurant group and 40 million followers on TikTok, where he blew up during the pandemic roasting other users’ cooking videos. HBO's late-night offering Last Week Tonight is an Emmys juggernaut—winning 30 statues in the past 10 years—and drives an impressive amount of sign-ups to the re-rechristened HBO Max, which is how its 48-year-old host has earned a deal nearly double the size of what his late-night colleagues make at the networks. Much to Oliver's dismay, last year Warner Bros. Discovery hoped to maximize streaming engagement by delaying the posting of the show's clips to YouTube for several days, but reversed course with the 12th season in February. $30 million In her heyday, Judge Judy commanded more than $45 million per year for her eponymous show and owned the rights to its catalog of episodes. Since selling the rights back to CBS and leaving the network in 2021 (she remains a producer on the network's Hot Bench), the 82-year-old Sheindlin has started up three new court shows on Amazon's streaming channels. In a 2024 deal renewal, Amazon began syndicating Judy Justice and Tribunal Justice out to hundreds of local TV stations, an important bargaining chip to maintain her lofty fees. Last September, Seacrest replaced the legendary Pat Sajak as the host of Wheel of Fortune, in addition to his regular hosting duties on American Idol and ABC’s New Years Eve program (which he also produces). Add in his radio show, which runs for four hours every weekday and pays him more than $10 million per year, and the 50-year-old host is almost never not on the air. Strahan is earning more money as a TV host than he ever did as a Hall of Fame defensive end for the New York Giants. He has lucrative deals with both Fox, as a studio analyst on the network's NFL coverage, and with ABC, to co-host Good Morning America and The $100,000 Pyramid. In addition to his TV work, Strahan also has revenue from personal appearances and his company, SMAC Entertainment, a talent management company that houses his personal brand. While meteoric talents have come and gone from Fox News, the 63-year-old Hannity has been at the network since its inception in 1996, making him the longest-running primetime host in cable history. And these days, TV isn't even his main gig—Hannity’s syndicated radio program reaches more than 600 stations nationwide, and his ownership stake in the show earns him more than $30 million each year. During an MSNBC contract renewal in late 2024, it's estimated that Maddow took a salary cut from $30 million annually to $25 million (a network spokesperson disputed the reported number), two years after switching from a five-nights-a-week schedule to appearing only on Mondays. Still, she remains the face of the recently rebranded MS NOW and has found other platforms to share her political commentary, including a weekly podcast and a handful of best-selling books. Morning shows are not only still highly profitable, in the case of Good Morning America, Forbes estimates the show accounts for the majority of ABC’s broadcast news revenue. That’s why the 64-year-old Roberts, who has co-anchored GMA for more than 20 years and has overseen the network’s No. 1 position in the ratings for the last 13 years consecutively, is the highest-paid talent at ABC. She also hosts primetime specials, such as a 20-year anniversary retrospective on Hurricane Katrina, which aired in late August. Going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump at a town hall in 2020 led to a massive pay raise for the 53-year-old Today host, who was the highest-paid member of the show even before the departure of co-host Hoda Kotb in January, because of her ability to handle important political interviews for NBC as well as holiday specials like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. The 54-year-old morning show fixture has been through many co-hosts since taking the Live! job in early 2001, working with Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and Ryan Seacrest before being paired with her husband, Mark Consuelos, in 2023. The duo also have a separate series on ESPN, Running With The Wolves, cataloging their journey owning Italian soccer club Campobasso FC. Just a few years into a 10-year, $210 million contract with Turner Sports, Barkley threatened to retire last fall after his network lost the rights to broadcast NBA games. Instead, a deal was struck allowing Inside The NBA to continue being produced by Turner—keeping in place Barkley’s long-time co-hosts Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O’Neal (who Forbes estimates makes $15 million for the role)— but air before and after games on ESPN and ABC. In March, the reigning champion of sports talk shows got a pay bump from $12 million to $20 million annually, believed to be the largest contract ever given to an ESPN talent. As part of the new deal, Stephen A. will actually appear on fewer ESPN programs, freeing up time for projects such as his podcast—and though he's denied it many times, perhaps a run at presidential politics. ESPN's deal with the former Indiana Colts punter includes talent fees for his work on College Gameday and a licensing fee to air The Pat McAfee Show on the network, which the 38-year-old host uses to pay his staff and production costs. The deal structure means less take-home pay, but he maintains ownership and editorial control of the program. McAfee also served as a longtime commentator for WWE matches until June, when he stepped back from the role, citing fatigue. ESPN’s desire to have a Super Bowl-ready broadcast team for the 2026 season came at a price, luring the Hall of Famer away from Fox with a contract that is just a wee bit larger than the one CBS gave to fellow former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Romo’s total includes money he pays to a traveling editorial assistant and spotter on game days. Romo’s 10-year, $180 million deal with CBS kicked off an earnings bonanza in early 2020, ushering in the era where NFL broadcast talent can earn more money than most of the players on the field. While the ex-Dallas Cowboys quarterback still sits in the No. 1 booth with Jim Nantz, he could soon be feeling the pressure around the corner from former defensive end JJ Watt, who was recently signed to CBS' No. 2 team. Though Cooper serves as an occasional correspondent to CBS’ 60 Minutes, the real money comes from his work on CNN, where he hosts a primetime show every weeknight and a weekly deep dive show on Sundays. The 58-year-old has been at the network since 2001. Since 2010, Harvey has hosted more than 1,100 episodes of Family Feud, not including international versions and spin-offs. One of those, Celebrity Family Feud, had its biggest season premiere in three years in July, attracting 4.2 million viewers. The 68-year-old earns also earns several million from a syndicated radio show on weekday mornings. A verbal slip-up from the Good Morning America co-host last fall led to Donald Trump’s libel lawsuit against ABC and the network’s subsequent $15 million settlement payout. But ABC immediately backed the 64-year-old political veteran, renewing his deal in December. In addition to GMA and This Week With George Stephanopolous, the pact includes a new politics show on Hulu and four hour-long primetime specials, though it’s ABC’s David Muir, not Stephanopolous, who will continue to host the network’s special news reports. In one of the more unique sports media moves in recent history, Fox let Joe Buck out of the last year of his contract in 2022 to join booth partner Troy Aikman at ESPN, in exchange for the broadcast rights to a Penn State-Purdue college football game. The 56-year-old Buck is now the highest-paid play-by-play announcer in sports history, and though he called a record 24 World Series at his previous network, he’s largely stuck to Monday Night Football at ESPN, outside of a few one-off MLB games like this year’s Opening Day Brewers-Yankees game. $16 million With a show ready-made for social media, Fallon’s The Tonight Show dominates late-night competitors in the digital space—but remains third in the ratings. And the 50-year-old host has found another use for his joyful enthusiasm, hosting game shows like Password and That’s My Jam as well as a new reality competition show On Brand that debuts on NBC on September 30. ABC’s late-night host since 2003, Kimmel has publicly mulled retirement for years and has a contract that will expire in mid-2026. Outside of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 57-year-old comedian hosts the rebooted celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and voiced a character in this summer’s Smurfs movie. During this Emmy season, Kimmel has actively campaigned for his direct competitor, Stephen Colbert, calling CBS’s claims that Colbert’s show was losing $40 million per year “beyond nonsensical." Colbert is a favorite to win the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series this weekend, which would be his first win as host of The Late Show—though he did previously win 10 for The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. The 61-year-old host will remain on CBS until next May, and news of his cancellation has only juiced his viewership ratings further over his competitors. Estimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts. The figures represent pretax earnings specifically for TV work, though many talents on the list earn significant additional income from radio, endorsements, entrepreneurial ventures, personal appearances, investments or other categories. Fees for representation (agent, manager, lawyer etc.) are not deducted. Hosts are compensated with variety of deal structures, including traditional salaries, overall production deals for a slate of projects, or licensing agreements from which a talent pays staff and production costs. The above rankings estimate the total earnings paid by media companies to talent.

Title: AT&T tracked employee attendance to find 'freeloaders.' Now, it admits the system is driving workers to the 'brink of frustration.'

AT&T is reducing its reliance on an employee-attendance tracking system, admitting to workers that it hasn't been fully accurate and is "driving people to the brink of frustration." The system, known internally as presence reporting, automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office. Most are required to log at least eight hours a day, five days a week, on-site. The telecom giant is one of several companies, including Amazon, JP Morgan, and Microsoft, tightening return-to-office mandates and using new tech to track employee compliance. Executives at these companies say the moves boost collaboration and productivity. In a meeting last month, chief marketing and growth officer Kellyn Kenny said her division is reducing its reliance on presence tracking in response to employee concerns about the system and its accuracy. The system was originally introduced to identify employees who weren't showing up in the office. "We recognize that there's things about the report that are not correct," she said, according to audio obtained by Business Insider. "It is not something that I expect anybody to be looking at on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis." AT&T is also deemphasizing use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide, a person familiar with the matter said. CEO John Stankey indicated in a memo to staffers last month (reported exclusively by Business Insider) that AT&T was shifting its use of behavioral data, such as presence reports. "We analyze patterns of behaviors from broad cohorts," he wrote, "to determine if the behavior being evaluated is consistent with our stated priorities and employment expectations." Stankey said that an individual's data must differ "significantly" from their peers before their name is attached to the behavior. "Some may view this approach as a matter of trust, and that perspective is understandable. In several forums, I've expressed concerns that past data indicated more outliers than we'd like," he said. Kenny said during the August meeting that the employee survey (which prompted the blunt memo from Stankey) had "lots of feedback" about the presence reports. She said the survey included critiques from workers who said they were struggling to make it to doctors' appointments without running afoul of the system, for example. Read more about Stankey's memo. While the survey does not appear to have included a direct question about presence reporting, it did ask whether employees agreed that AT&T's "policies and systems support me in delivering my best work." Kenny said in the meeting that roughly half of the respondents in her organization said "no," and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate and presence reports in the freeform response. "I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created," Kenny said. "I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust." Business Insider has spoken with roughly a dozen employees from multiple divisions of the company this year about the system and its impact on their workplace experience. A spokesperson for AT&T declined to comment for this story, instead citing Stankey's August memo. Multiple employees told Business Insider that the system doesn't just log badge swipes at the entrance or exit; the presence report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to infer the hours an employee was at their assigned office. The tool was rolled out in response to the RTO push that began two years ago, and its usage ramped up as the attendance policy grew increasingly strict. Other companies, like Amazon and JP Morgan in particular, have also closely monitored employee behavior at work. Amazon previously used categories like "inconsistent badger" or "zero badger" depending on an employee's compliance with a three-day in-office mandate. The company ended up nixing the labels in favor of providing raw badging data to managers to use at their discretion. A recent survey by commercial real-estate company CBRE found that more than two-thirds of employers track employee compliance with attendance policies, and more than a third have taken some level of enforcement action. Enforcement that is too strict or error-prone can cause other headaches within an organization — pushing out experienced employees, making it harder to hire new talent, or undermining motivation and trust within the organization. Amazon's internal documents from last year indicated that its RTO policy was hampering its ability to recruit top AI talent, and a Harvard leadership expert said Meta's abruptly shifting RTO effort in 2023 was likely to cause a "huge amount of distrust" in the company. At the AT&T marketing and growth team meeting, Kenny said that the system helped leadership identify "freeloaders" who showed up for 30 minutes or two hours per day. "There were people who badged in for 10 minutes, got themselves a cup of coffee, and then left," she said. "The report was good for identifying the people who were abusing the system. We do not need this report for that purpose anymore, because we took action on the people who were the free riders." AT&T did not specify how many workers have been disciplined or dismissed in connection with their presence report information. AT&T workers told Business Insider that apparent glitches in the system could also be a hassle for employees who were pulling their weight. They said that in the first few months of this year, while the five-day RTO mandate was phasing in, their reports could be wrong by as many as several hours. In addition, briefly badging into an AT&T facility on a day off could trigger a person's daily average hours to drop below the mandatory eight hours for the week. "It was at its worst in March and April," one worker in New Jersey told Business Insider. "Sometimes you'd step out for lunch, and then it would stop counting." Though there were no immediate consequences from an incorrect report, employees were concerned the erroneous data could make them targets for layoffs. Some other business leaders have said RTO mandates have "encouraged" workers to quit voluntarily, allowing companies to avoid more expensive layoffs. AT&T previously told Business Insider the goal of its in-office rules is to foster better collaboration. It has also undertaken a multiyear effort to shrink its workforce. The company started this year with around 140,000 employees, down from more than 160,000 at the start of 2023. Telecom competitors Verizon and T-Mobile started 2025 with 99,000 and 70,000, respectively. Stankey has said that the company is looking to cut some $6 billion in costs as it decommissions its legacy copper-based network in favor of new fiber and 5G technologies. One worker in Georgia said that the presence reports changed the workplace reality for many salaried managerial workers, who aren't used to such detailed tracking of their workday. "We're supposed to be able to work a more flexible thing as long as we get our work done," he said. Another effect of the crackdown on underperformers has been the erosion of motivation for some higher performers to put in extra time. "The attitude has shifted," the New Jersey employee said. "They only count eight hours, so I'm just going to work eight hours." The AT&T employees Business Insider spoke with said their presence reports have gotten more accurate over the past few months. One shared their report with annotations that showed such an improvement. The question of employees' trust could take more than a few months to resolve. Have a tip?

Title: How a $1 billion TikTok challenger unraveled
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-challenger-flip-unraveled-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-12T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
Flip employees were riding high in mid-January. The TikTok challenger had just cracked the Apple App Store's top-five ranking. Downloads soared 855% month over month, Sensor Tower data showed, fueled by TikTok's imminent ban in the US. It was a dream scenario for an app that — with over $230 million in funding and a roughly $1.1 billion valuation — promised to reinvent social shopping through a mix of product reviews and entertaining videos. Raging wildfires had forced Flip's CEO, Noor Agha, to evacuate his Los Angeles home before he had time to retrieve his car or pack an extra pair of underwear. But in a January 15 interview with Agha and COO Eduardo Vivas, the executives sounded upbeat, if not a little frenzied. "To be in the business that we're in, given all the changes that are happening, is obviously very exciting for us," Vivas said at the time. Seven months later, Flip was dead. This is the story of how Flip crashed, as told by nine former employees, along with investors, creator partners, talent managers, and brands. Agha, Vivas, and other company representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Days after Business Insider's interview with Flip's top executives, President Donald Trump halted the TikTok ban. Flip raced to sustain its momentum, pouring money into ads and launching a $100 million equity fund to woo creators. With TikTok back in play, the buzz fizzled. Things unraveled quickly from there. In April, Trump tariffs raised costs for some Flip vendors and brand partners. Then Flip slashed jobs and began clearing out its LA headquarters. In May, the company received an eviction notice for its LA warehouse. By June, the company had slipped out of Apple's US App Store top 100, and within weeks, it cut much of its remaining staff without severance, three ex-staffers said. Flip shut down its app in late August. The company's demise caught many off guard. Employees who had watched a spike in downloads and onboarding of new brands believed business was humming. "I was as shocked as I could have been when that last round of layoffs came and how quickly it dissolved from there," one former Flip worker said. "This year, there were very optimistic conversations about where we were going and the idea that this was going to become huge." Flip's fate showcases the uphill battle that consumer startups face when trying to compete with tech giants like TikTok, Meta, or Google. The company spent millions of dollars to recruit creators and onboard new users via ads and referral credits. But competing with Big Tech companies, which have billions of users and the ability to outspend you at every turn, is no easy task. "It's actually crazy to build a new complete social platform from scratch," Agha told Business Insider in January. "The amount of pieces to make a social platform work is so insanely hard." It also demonstrates how difficult it has been for US companies to blend social video and commerce. TikTok has struggled to live up to its leadership's expectations for its e-commerce platform, Shop. Meta pulled back on some of its e-commerce bets, and Amazon killed its TikTok-like feed, Inspire, earlier this year. "Changing shopping behaviors is a slow and gradual process," said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. "It takes time." Agha, who was born in Iraq, launched Flip in 2019 alongside cofounder Jonathan Ellman. Like many other founders, Agha is brimming with big ideas. "This was his app, his dream, his world he wanted to create," one former staffer said. Flip's original business idea was a try-before-you-buy social network where customers would receive clothing in the mail, take photos of the fits, and ask other users to vote on which items they should purchase. Fashion tech was in vogue, with apps like Snapchat experimenting with virtual try-on technology. Some entrepreneurs were eyeing China's massive social-shopping industry and considering how they might bring the business to the US. Live-shopping platform Whatnot had just kicked off in the US, later raising hundreds of millions of dollars at a roughly $5 billion valuation. While TikTok hadn't yet launched Shop in the US, it had begun experimenting with e-commerce features like in-video shopping links. By August 2021, when Flip announced its $28 million Series A round, the company had pivoted from try-ons to user-generated product reviews and live shopping videos. Flip was "well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of China and revolutionize social commerce in the US," investor Ullas Naik of Streamlined Ventures said at the time. Flush with cash, the company moved to grow its audience, unveiling a creator program in December 2021 that would pay users commissions on sales generated through their videos. Big social-media stars like Patrick Starrr, Hyram Yarbro, and Addison "Rae" Easterling joined the app. The company was growing quickly, writing in a July 2022 press release that it had expanded its user base by 500% in the first half of that year. Flip fundraised on that growth, announcing in July a $60 million Series B round at a $500 million valuation. That same year, the company moved into a new three-floor office in the El Segundo neighborhood of LA. The office had many of the markers of a buzzy tech startup. Workers had access to free coffee and snacks like Uncrustables. There was even a trampoline, which no one used, three former employees said. Music blared over the speakers, with one electronic track on repeat that Agha particularly enjoyed, three ex-staffers said. "The vibes in the building were always high energy," a third ex-employee said. While the company said it planned to use its 2022 funding to expand its team, it generally kept its head count lean. Much of the company worked in its El Segundo headquarters, where it required staffers to be in person five days a week. Some workers in functions like data entry were asked to work six days a week, with overtime pay. "It was a very intense startup vibe," said the first ex-staffer. "The people that work here are fully bought in." To keep growing in 2023, the company splurged on referrals, offering in-app credits sometimes worth over $100 to get new users signed up and scrolling more, The Information and The Free Press reported. In April 2024, Flip raised a $144 million round with participation from the adtech firm AppLovin, doubling its valuation to around $1.1 billion. A couple of months earlier, it had formed a partnership with AppLovin to power ads for brands on Flip. Around the time of the investment, the company also acquired Curated, a platform that connected shoppers with experts for advice on big purchases, for $330 million in stock. Curated's CEO at the time, Vivas, became Flip's chief operating officer. Vivas, a serial entrepreneur and high school dropout who previously sold a startup to LinkedIn, was on AppLovin's board of directors. The company was racing to expand Flip's user base as it sought to take on the industry's goliath: TikTok Shop. Like social-shopping competitor LTK, the company believed it had to expand beyond pure shopping content. Flip launched a new set of non-shopping videos, called Clips, in July 2024. "We think of shopping as a form of entertainment," Vivas told Business Insider in January. "People do it to have fun and enjoy themselves, but a feed cannot just be shopping content." Riding off the tailwinds of the looming TikTok ban, Flip downloads spiked. The company also invested in a stream of ads on TikTok to lure creators. Inside the company, staffers saw the surge of new users as a breakthrough moment. "We all thought it was going to take off from there," the first former Flip employee said. There was a feeling that "we made it past all of the hard parts of being a startup," they said. To boost non-shopping content, Flip pledged $100 million to its "Founding Creators Fund." It promised creators "grants" of up to $100,000 that would scale with Flip's valuation — so long as the creators kept posting to the app. Contracts set a five-year timeline for payouts, unless an acquisition triggered them earlier. Overall, a mix of user acquisition costs and macroeconomic headwinds stunted Flip's push to take on TikTok Shop. "It was ultimately just unsustainable because they had these very high customer acquisition costs as well as customer retention costs," Canaves said. And as Trump delayed the TikTok ban multiple times, the desperate hunt for an alternative lost its urgency. "It is really challenging for new apps to break through," Canaves said. "I think they struggled to scale in the way that they wanted to." Flip wrote on its website last month that its mission of building a "social platform that gave everyone a voice" had come to a close. It said it had reached 16.5 million people, crossed 5 billion video views, paid $13.4 million to creators, and driven $375 million in sales for brands. The statement didn't provide a reason for the closure. The app's shuttering caught some brand partners off guard. Haak Wear, a hat seller, addressed the Flip shutdown in a blog post on its website. "This situation has reminded us of the importance of having multiple touchpoints with our community," the company wrote. Five former staffers said they felt out of the loop on the health of the business while working at Flip. Flip is not the only tech platform to make big promises to partners and then shut its doors. Buzzy shopping app Nate abruptly closed its creator program in December 2022, for example. "It wasn't surprising that the app was going to shut down at some point," said Tara Blair Ball, a creator in Flip's Founding Creator Fund. "I don't think it made sense how they were making money to warrant the pay that they were giving." Even as Flip's downloads were surging in January, Agha acknowledged that merging social media with commerce is challenging in the US market. "It's definitely crazy freaking hard," Agha said during the January interview. "Almost killed us a thousand times. No question." Have a tip?

Title: David Ellison shows he's serious about fighting Netflix and Disney for Hollywood's crown

David Ellison just showed he's serious about challenging Netflix and Disney for the Hollywood crown — and he's moving at lightning speed. The media mogul and his new company, Paramount Skydance, are preparing a bid for rival Warner Bros. Discovery, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Business Insider couldn't independently confirm the report. WBD declined to comment, and Paramount didn't respond to requests for comments. The news sent waves through the media industry, in part because of how quickly Ellison seems to be moving to consolidate power. As a reminder, the deal that combined his company, Skydance, with Paramount closed just last month. It helps that Ellison has the financial backing of his father, Larry Ellison, who briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's richest person this week. WBD had planned to split into two companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, next year. Paramount is preparing a majority cash bid for the whole company, backed by the Ellison family, the WSJ reported. Together, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery — which owns assets like the Warner Bros. film and TV studios and the HBO Max streaming service — would create a Hollywood titan. "There's absolutely no doubt that a combination of these two companies would result in the deepest roster of blockbuster franchise IP in all of Hollywood," said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. It would also give Ellison a host of cable TV networks like CNN and some additional sports rights, and create potential antitrust scrutiny. Such a merger would make it clear that Ellison wants to compete with the industry leaders, not just shepherd Paramount into the streaming era. Before this news, Ellison had already hinted at grander ambitions, signing a $7.7 billion UFC deal less than a week after the Paramount-Skydance deal closed. Even with the merger, competing with Netflix and Disney would be an uphill battle. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have ranked fifth among streaming services in watchtime on US connected TVs in July, according to Nielsen — behind YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ with Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. "A mash-up of both streaming services would require a very expensive and long technological revamp that isn't guaranteed to spur subscriber growth and slow churn," Katz said. Still, Wall Street is thrilled with the potential combination. On Thursday afternoon, WBD's stock soared as much as 37%, while Paramount shares spiked more than 10%. One reason: potential cost savings. A marriage between two major studios would lead to efficiencies, likely including major layoffs. For Hollywood's creative community, it would mean one fewer buyer, further consolidating Tinseltown. "There's one less green light place in town, which puts pressure on the agents and managers," an advisor close to both companies said. But that one company would also have a lot of money to spend, this person added. On Wednesday at a Goldmach Sachs media conference, WBD CEO David Zaslav predicted the streaming landscape would "rationalize" further, leaving just a few superpowers remaining. "Right now, there's only five global players: there's Amazon, Netflix, Disney, us, and YouTube," Zaslav said. He didn't mention Paramount. With such a deal, Ellison would show he's committed to being one of the entertainment giants left standing. Jump to

As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. I was in Scottsdale yesterday, recording a podcast on site at Deloitte’s Next Generation CEO Program, when news about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk began to trickle in. We had been talking about the challenge of being a public figure in business or politics these days, the need for visionary and visible leadership, when visibility can come at a price. Many CEOs have been on high alert since UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down in midtown Manhattan last year while walking to an investor meeting. We’ve seen anger mounting on college campuses—Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University—along with increased threats to leaders and public calls to violence. Those realities impact how I report. I’ve been more mindful of my own security since my former colleague Daniel Pearl was murdered in 2002. Gone are the days when terrorists would turn to a journalist to tell their story. Instead of protecting journalists, a press badge can make us a target. I’m more sensitive to the consequences of my reporting on others, having seen someone fired for a quote that felt mild to me but provocative to his paranoid employer. That’s more a result of experience than caution. I’ve long advised billionaires to stop giving me their kids’ names. I don’t chase down big names for trite quotes that no one needs to read, nor do I dig for details that people have a right to keep private. Conversations about policy are more likely to be off the record in this environment but I’m still clear that my customer is the reader, not the people we cover. I was once stalked by a man who felt entitled to harass me about something I’d said on early-morning TV. I dismissed him as an eccentric with too much time on his hands until he emailed one day to ask why I’d brought a baby into the office. That baby was mine, and our security team realized he’d been hanging around the lobby. It was a wakeup call about risks, which is sadly bound to be top of mind this morning for any CEO or public figure.

Ellison becomes world’s richest person Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is now the world’s richest person with a net worth near $393 billion, beating out Elon Musk on Wednesday, per the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. Ellison’s wealth increased by more than $100 billion this week spurred by optimism about the company’s business which was buttressed by Oracle’s earnings call on Tuesday, during which CEO Safra Catz predicted $18 billion in cloud infrastructure business for the fiscal year—up 77% from fiscal 2025—and up to $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal 2030. Trump meets with Polish President On Wednesday, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!”—responding to reports that Polish forces had shot down several Russian drones after they entered Poland’s airspace. Trump also held a call with Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Wednesday, according to Nawrocki’s social media updates. Justice Department appeals for Trump’s ability to fire Fed Gov The U.S. Justice Department has asked a federal appeals court for permission for President Trump to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after a U.S. District Judge temporarily blocked her removal.

Title: Do We Need to Interview Candidates In Person Again?

Interviewing I help hiring teams improve speed & quality. Ex-Amazon, Ex-Expedia. September 11, 2025 Are we about to go full circle and return to in-person interviews for most salaried roles? COVID pushed us to remote, Zoom-based interviews. Emerging tech then allowed employers to leverage AI to prompt interviewers on questions to use to interview humans. And now those candidates are responding by using AI to ace interviews. Which has caused folks like me to push TA leaders to get out ahead of this. Especially because some employers are even encouraging candidates to use AI during the interviewing process. If everyone is using AI, how will we know what a candidate can actually do? Does it matter if they need AI to do great work, as long as it’s great work? Will the future be bot-on-bot action, with employer AI agents screening and interviewing candidate bots? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that some companies are going old school, returning to in-person interviews, mostly because they’re fearful of hiring someone who’s aced the interview only because they have help from AI. 1. Based on my conversations with heads of TA, candidate use of AI is about 80% of the pull to return to in-person interviews. With the rising risk of candidate fraud — especially AI-assisted identity fraud and cheating — companies like Google and Deloitte are starting to prioritize in-person live interviews over remote video interviews. If you’re just getting up to speed on the risks, check out some of my previous articles here: 2. Another small reason for the return to in-person interviews — maybe 15% — is related to the big shift back to in-office work. Several TA leaders I spoke with said in-person interview requests are being driven somewhat by a need for a realistic job preview and an improved opportunity to connect with and sell candidates. In-person allows the candidate to meet the team in person, see the office and learn about their commute pattern, and experience the culture. 3. The third reason — maybe explaining just 5% of the pull — is related to beliefs that 1) soft skills and motivation are even more important to predicting success in a world where most knowledge is just a quick ChatGPT prompt away and that 2) human interviewers can better evaluate those soft skills in person, sitting across from the candidate. I think most of us have mixed feelings on this. The table below outlines the pros and cons of live, in-person interviews: The good news? Companies are 100% prepared for this shift back to in-person interviews. Just kidding. Most of us are not ready. In fact, because of the uncertain economy, recruiter and recruiting coordinator layoffs, more reliance on assessment-related tech to interview, and generally slower hiring, candidate experience and interviewer capabilities have not improved in the past three years. In fact, if you talk to candidates and hiring managers in focus groups as my team does, they’ll often say it’s gotten worse. What do we need to do if you and your business leaders decide to return to in-person interviews as the norm? 1. Training: We need to ensure our hiring teams are trained, not just in behavioral interviewing, legal risks, biases, and process. They also need to be aligned on your company’s new hard and soft skill needs — AI is disrupting a lot of jobs, so a more prescriptive weighting and shared philosophy on what’s trainable and what’s not will be key to selecting the right talent. For some companies, that’ll mean a smaller weighting on hard skills and a bigger emphasis on soft skills like curiosity, empathy, learning agility, building trust, influence/gaining buy-in, problem-solving, and communication skills. For others, that’ll mean a bigger focus on the expert skills and smaller focus on the supporting skills - and unfortunately, expert skills and soft skills are harder to evaluate than the supporting skills that AI will likely take over. 2. Candidate experience: Take advantage of the in-person interview to create a better candidate experience. In-demand candidates still need to be sold, even if it’s an employer’s market. Show off that expensive real estate, go old school and set up a non-interview lunch with the team, and get an executive to jump in and wow them with insights into your company’s compelling future. Some of us might need to rebuild the muscles around creating a great candidate experience for interviewed candidates, which includes excellent preinterview instructions on what to expect, a nice “we’re expecting you” greeting with reception/security, on-time, prepared interviewers, and excellent communication and expectation setting on next steps. This focus on CX might even bring us back to hiring recruiting coordinators. 3. Scheduling: Place advance holds on busy interviewer and hiring manager calendars for in-office interviews and same-day hiring decisions. We need speed to get quality, so don’t let in-person interviews cause you to miss out on top talent. 4. Identity verification: Ensure you have a mechanism to ensure that the person you screened over Zoom is the same person who shows up for your in-person interviews. Identity fraud — where someone uses AI or another interviewer to complete and pass the pre–onsite interview screen and assessments — is a bigger problem than it used to be. Talk to your HR and security team about the rigor needed to verify identity. 5. Talent advising: Train your recruiters to move from transactional process owners to true Talent Advisors. The business needs us in TA to level up the role we play in interviewing and selection given the renewed prioritization on quality of hire. Check out these free resources I’ve pulled together on how to be a Talent Advisor. And if you’re going to LinkedIn Talent Connect in San Diego in October, sign up for one of my sessions on quality of hire and reducing candidate fraud. 6. Leverage AI: Use generative AI to help your hiring teams translate job description language and your company-wide values/behaviors into hiring criteria, interview focus areas, interview questions, and good answer rubrics. But don’t just trust generic AI content on interviewing — your company may have a very different hiring approach than the median content AI has been trained on. Be sure to review what AI generates and correct anything that’s not in line with the business VP’s goals around what she wants her org makeup to look like in two to three years. Too often, TA has seen the middle-funnel work of interviewing and selection as something the business designs and leads independently. In fact, I’d argue most recruiting teams play a very small role between screened-candidate presentation and the post-interview decision action items (offer or decline). That needs to change. The risks associated with AI, the cost of bad hires, and the significant time investment around hiring requires us to lead more around the middle of the funnel. This starts with leading a conversation with the business around the pros and cons of remote interviews, asynchronous assessments, AI, and in-person interviews. Are you seeing a shift in your org to in-person interviews? Just for key roles, just for salaried corporate roles, just for executive hiring? I’ll post this article on my personal LinkedIn feed, and I’d love it if you’d share your plans and the why for your approach to interviewing in 2025 and beyond.

Title: If the AI Industry Fails, It Could Take the Rest of Us Down With It

Don't let AI critics tell you it's good for nothing: the amount of money being spent on AI infrastructure is so enormous that it’s literally propping up the US economy. The drawback, of course, is that if the AI industry fails, it could drag the rest of the economy down with it. In 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an incredible 24 percent — what the investment firm Charles Schwab understatedly called a "very good year." Since 2023, nearly half the growth was clustered in just a handful of tech stocks known as the "magnificent seven": Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple. And as the Atlantic recently noted, the companies most heavily involved in the AI boom have yet to see that success manifest in anywhere except the stock market. Though Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla are expected to have spent some $560 billion on AI development by the beginning of next year, their collective revenue from AI comes in at a paltry $35 billion. In the first half of 2025, the Atlantic notes, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth in the United States than all consumer spending combined. This revenue gap is the key crisis facing the tech industry — and the broader economy — in their quest to build an AI future. Thanks to roundly horrible performance in actual workplace environments, revenue remains illusive for the vast majority of AI deployments. Still, managers across industries are being pressured to show financial gains from the tech, even when the software isn’t delivering. That’s causing companies to do some creative accounting with their staff, laying off workers or slowing down hiring to inflate AI’s numbers. As the Atlantic highlights, this is leading to the very real possibility of a rupture forming in the broader economy, where companies induce rounds of layoffs to satisfy executives, without anything to show for it in the bottom line. In other words, we’re barreling toward a future where unemployment could rise while productivity takes a nosedive — dramatically slowing the economy as a result. That scenario isn’t exactly unprecedented. The computer boom of the 1980s took a similar turn, when early email software prompted executives to lay off secretaries and typists, resulting in specialized white collar workers actually spending more time sending emails than on their typical roles. "Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite," computer scientist Cal Newport told the Atlantic. "I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI." There’s just one crucial difference: email isn’t propping up half the stock market.

Title: Progress Report: Saks Global Execs Talk Integrations, Plans and Opportunities

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Growth with Amazon overseas, reducing over-assortments, reviving the Saks flagship's holiday light show, and digging into the data to differentiate from competitors are on the agenda. Senior Editor, Retail Saks Global’s $2.7 billion takeover of the Neiman Marcus Group hasn’t been easy and has kept many vendors on edge. But in a media briefing Tuesday morning at Bergdorf Goodman, Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, along with Emily Essner, president and chief commercial officer, and Tracy Margolies, president of Bergdorf Goodman, outlined progress, as they see it, in the integration, as well as opportunities for the future. Combining the Saks and Neiman’s merchandising and marketing teams into a single organization, from a human capital perspective, is “wholly done,” Metrick said. “They’ve largely been integrated, though there’s always work to do.” He said there’s about a 50-50 split with half the team coming from Neiman’s and half from Saks. Related Articles Fashion Scoops Moncler Takes Over Saks Windows With Edward Enninful's EE72 Collection Fashion Features Saks Celebrates New York Fashion Week With Cocktail Event at Le Chalet at L'Avenue Data will be key to differentiating from competitors, Metrick emphasized. “We’ve got data on 30 million luxury consumers. We have 700 million visits to our website and record every move that customers make. We understand more and more about this luxury consumer.” You May Also Like Inventory sharing between Saks and Neiman’s will be another competitive advantage, he said. “It’s going to start with online fulfillment, and then it’s going to move into the stores. So you’re looking at every customer that walks into a Saks or Neiman’s store, any size they want, any color they want, any designer they want, anything they want that we have, you’ll have access to.” On store closures, “There’s probably an opportunity to rationalize our fleet,” though it wouldn’t be based on the integration of Saks and Neiman’s, Metrick said. “What you’ll see over the next couple of years is an ordinary course type of closings — nothing on a large scale.” In a past interview, Metrick projected fewer than 10 closings. Already, Saks in Palm Beach closed, and Neiman’s in Dallas has an uncertain future, but remains open at least through the holiday season. Saks Global bought Neiman’s in December. Metrick suggested Saks Global stores have been seriously over-assorted. “I want us to return back to our roots of being that fashion arbiter, that authenticator. Customers have simply too much choice,” he said. “We figured out through hyper-personalization, the exact assortment of product [shoppers] would be interested in when they go onto saks.com. Everyone’s home page at saks.com is personalized. The bottom line is, we have to do more with less.” Saks Global is reducing its vendor matrix by 25 percent with some vendors leaving voluntarily while others are being dropped. Earlier this year, Saks Fifth Avenue launched a storefront on Amazon Luxury Stores, following Amazon’s investment in Saks’ purchase of Neiman’s. It’s a move aimed at boosting the revenues of Saks and some vendor partners, though it poses some risk to hurting the luxury image of Saks and the participating vendors. On the other hand, “There’s an international opportunity with Amazon,” Metrick said. “We’re not thinking about it for 2025 but more as we get into next year and the year after. Amazon is built ready for luxury, globally. There might be opportunities in specific regions and countries,” which could be enticing to brands. Metric acknowledged that much of the conversation surrounding Saks Global has been about late or non-payments to vendors. “I appreciate that and I’m aware it’s caused a lot of pressure and has resulted in noise,” Metrick said. Certain vendors continue to complain about overdue payments, but the CEO said: “We are largely in line with our payments with our brand partners. We need to move on from that part of the conversation and move towards saying, ‘Good news. We’re going to have $600 million in synergies, so now we can pay you.” The expected $600 million in annual savings will come through layoffs, consolidation of functions, and increased buying power over suppliers. Bergdorf Goodman maintains its own buying team, separate from the centralized Saks/Neiman’s organization. “They want to get paid, but that’s not going to excite them,” Metrick added, referring to vendors. “What’s going to excite them is [Saks Global] adding 50 percent of volume over the next five years, through knowing the customer, giving you more space, being more efficient with your inventory, better sell-throughs, and making it more special through events and activations.” While not disclosing any new financial results, Metrick suggested Saks Global is on sounder financial footing, noting the company recently closed on $600 million in financing through a bond exchange with existing holders. “There is north of $2 billion in bonds out there,” Metrick said. With more money available, the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship holiday light show, which was canceled last year to the disappointment of the hundreds of thousands who crowd the streets to see the show each year, is being revived this year and will happen in November, Essner announced. Essner said new Saks Fifth Avenue shop on Amazon was launched “with the hypothesis there’s still an untapped luxury consumer we can access and serve on Amazon. We’ve really found that’s true. The vast majority are new customers, not [those] shopping Saks previously. We are selling true luxury. We’re selling very high price point handbags and dresses in a way that surprised us. And it’s early days. There’s a lot more to build here, but we feel very good with some of the early signals.” About 50 vendors launched with Saks on Amazon. The market has been curious on how Saks Global evolves Saks and Neiman’s and to the degree they differentiate. “We’re being very intentional about this,” Essner said. Saks Fifth Avenue is “really for the fashion enthusiast who is seeking originality, who views Saks Fifth Avenue as their partner in discovery. Neiman Marcus is really for a sophisticate who doesn’t settle.” In terms of items sold, there’s an over 60 percent overlap; the percentage is even higher in terms of brands. Also on Tuesday, Saks Global unveiled its latest Luxury Pulse Survey, which from July 17-21 queried 995 U.S. luxury consumers over age 18. Among the most optimistic of the findings, 56 percent of luxury consumers said they planned to spend the same or more on luxury in August, September and October, compared with the previous three months, representing a 9 percentage-point increase compared with the April survey and nearly flat compared to the same time last year. But that also means that 44 percent of luxury consumers plan to spend less. Whether that all translates into better business for Saks Global this fall depends on how much more, or less, shoppers spend. Saks surveys luxury consumers on a quarterly basis. Based on the July read, Saks does anticipate more spending through October, which Essner attributed to “a desire to treat themselves, which is something we hadn’t seen for a while, as well as feeling better about the overall economy, and their need to update their wardrobes. Some of that might be seasonal. Some of that might be the reality of the fashion coming up, but overall, those were very positive signs.” The survey also found that 32 percent of luxury consumers feel optimistic about the economy, up 4 percentage points compared with the April survey, but 13 percentage points lower than the same time last year. Fifty-nine percent of luxury consumers feel good about their personal finances, 8 percentage points above the April survey, but a 9 point decline from the same time last year. Asked about rising prices, Essner said luxury consumers “are very concerned about value.” That value can be inherent in the craftsmanship and in the design of the product, she said. “The luxury consumer is not necessarily concerned about price.” With tariffs impacting prices, Essner said: “Some brand partners are being thoughtful about their assortments. They’re being thoughtful about pricing, looking potentially in some places to introduce more entry price points as appropriate. In general, what we’re hearing from a tariff perspective is midsingle-digit price increases. That’s very much in line with the increases consumers have seen over the last few years and not going to necessarily stand out.” When querying luxury shoppers in July, Essner said tariffs were not hitting in a big way. “It was a little bit too soon to tell in terms of how, especially the luxury consumer, is going to react, because, frankly, the impact of tariffs isn’t something that they have seen. The bigger concern, the macroeconomic noise generated from all of the tariff discussion.” Looking ahead, Essner noted that recently the saks.com homepage became “a fully personalized experience. We will be taking that capability to neimanmarcus.com and bergdorfgoodman.com.” She also said over 60 percent of the luxury brands Saks Global carries are working on exclusives for the fall season. At Bergdorf Goodman, “We have over 120 events for this fall,” said Margolies. She also said Bergdorf’s, as part of improving its store experience, launched new shops for Tom Ford ready-to-wear and Dior beauty, and will launch a new Schiaparelli shop in the fourth quarter.

A project of Common Dreams Phoebe Trotter:ptrotter@fwwatch.org Report pulls punches on pesticide regulation as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation This afternoon the White House’s “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) Commission released its strategy report outlining the Trump administration’s priorities for policies to overhaul the food system and address chronic disease. In keeping with White House promises to monied industrial agriculture lobbyists, the report does not endorse increased regulation for toxic pesticides. Fully 71% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans support increasing restrictions on the use of pesticides in agriculture. The report comes as Congressional Republicans further controversial Cancer Gag legislation to shield pesticide manufacturers from health-related lawsuits. The Cancer Gag Act, expected to be reintroduced as the “Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act,” is reportedly a House Farm Bill priority; House Republicans included related language in a July appropriations vote to prevent EPA from improving pesticide warning labels. Meanwhile, the report makes only passing mention of PFAS – lab-made “forever chemicals” that have been linked to a large range of health problems including various cancers, altered hormone levels, decreased birth weights, digestive inflammation and reduced vaccine response. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back previously-established protections for PFAS in drinking water through Lee Zeldin and the Environmental Protection Agency. In response to the release of the report, Food & Water Watch Senior Food Policy Analyst Rebecca Wolf issued the following statement: Food & Water Watch research catalogues pesticide giant Bayer’s multimillion dollar push for Cancer Gag legislation, introduced across the country, failing in nine states and passing in two (the bill is still pending in North Carolina). The push comes as Bayer has spent over $11 billion settling more than 100,000 cancer lawsuits related to its Roundup pesticide, whose key ingredient glyphosate the World Health Organization defines as a probable carcinogen. Food & Water Watch mobilizes regular people to build political power to move bold and uncompromised solutions to the most pressing food, water, and climate problems of our time. We work to protect people's health, communities, and democracy from the growing destructive power of the most powerful economic interests. "Universal healthcare, housing, and anti-poverty programs are considered more 'radical' on Fox News than mass murder," said one healthcare advocate. Fox News host Brian Kilmeade is facing calls to resign after suggesting earlier this week that the state should execute homeless people who decline help during a live broadcast. Kilmeade made the comments during a Wednesday episode of Fox & Friends, during which the panel discussed the recent shocking video of the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska aboard a train in Charlotte, North Carolina, by a mentally ill homeless man, which has ignited a flurry of often racist vitriol on the right toward Black Americans and homeless people. "They are leveraging this platform to share untruths about vaccines to scare people," said one doctor Kennedy fired from the panel. Health officials working under Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may seek to restrict access to the Covid-19 vaccine for people under 75 years old. The Washington Post reported Friday that the officials plan to justify the move by citing reports from an unverified database to make the claim that the shots caused the deaths of 25 children. “Marco Rubio has claimed the power to designate people terrorist supporters based solely on what they think and say,” said one free speech advocate. Free speech advocates are sounding the alarm about a bill in the US House of Representatives that they fear could allow Secretary of State Marco Rubio to strip US citizens of their passports based purely on political speech. The bill, introduced by Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), will come up for a hearing on Wednesday. According to The Intercept:

Title: Microsoft continues layoffs with 42 more roles cut for the fifth month in a row — with an $80B reason behind it

The company is investing $80 billion in AI, but it faces criticism amid ongoing job eliminations in a shift towards automation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It’s a new month, and unfortunately, that means even more layoffs at Microsoft. This time, it’s not thousands of employees, but just over 40 roles in Redmond (via Seattle Times). Even so, it marks the fifth consecutive month of job cuts in 2025, bringing the total to more than 15,000 employees since Microsoft announced its $80 billion AI investment commitment. The question now is whether these smaller September layoffs signal a slowdown, or if Microsoft plans to continue trimming staff month after month to make way for its AI-powered future. Microsoft at least appears to be following a trend regarding its layoffs. The latest round in Redmond targeted engineering, product management, and legal roles at its headquarters. The cuts are far smaller than earlier rounds — 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July — but they still form part of Microsoft’s broader restructuring plan. This steady drip of layoffs suggests a deliberate effort to keep pressure on costs, even if the numbers are smaller. It raises an uncomfortable question: has Microsoft normalized monthly layoffs as part of its new way of operating? In 2025, Microsoft announced that $80 billion investment into AI — a $25 billion increase from the previous year. The money is going into data centers, custom chipsets, cloud expansion, and further development of tools like Copilot. Satya Nadella described this as the “enigma of success,” pointing to record profits but also the pressure to reduce costs. That tension is at the heart of recent criticism. The investment commitment came before the bulk of layoffs, creating frustration as Microsoft pushed ahead with massive spending while cutting thousands of jobs. At the same time, the company has been urging employees to rely more heavily on AI tools in their workflows. Microsoft also laid out 40 job roles at risk of being eliminated by AI. The layoffs also followed news that Microsoft had secured $6 billion in government savings over three years, adding to the perception that the cuts are less about financial necessity and more about long-term priorities. The bigger picture is clear: Microsoft is shifting resources to secure dominance in AI, not responding to immediate financial struggles. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Layoffs at Microsoft seem to be part of a bigger transformation, and it’s not all about saving money. Roles have been cut across key parts of the company, including Xbox, LinkedIn, engineering, legal, product management, research, support, and sales. At the same time, Microsoft is still hiring — but the focus has shifted. The company is bringing in talent for AI, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and Copilot development. Satya Nadella has even said that a portion of Microsoft’s code is now written by AI, and I’ve noticed a new role floating around online: “professional vibe code cleaners” (via LinkedIn). I’d like to think anyone using AI to write code at Microsoft can actually code themselves, or at least I hope so. To balance this shift, Microsoft is also investing in reskilling. Its $4 billion “Elevate” program aims to help millions of people prepare for jobs in the AI era, reflecting a longer-term vision of how the workforce will evolve. Any round of layoffs, especially at Microsoft’s scale, creates anxiety and uncertainty. A culture of fear and job insecurity can quickly take hold. On top of that, employees face the added pressure of learning new AI tools just as those same tools are replacing traditional roles — something that understandably leaves a sour taste. This isn’t unique to Microsoft. Amazon, Meta, Google, and others are making similar AI-driven cuts. Workflows across the industry are shifting as companies double down on automation and AI-powered systems. The September layoffs are not an isolated event, but part of a broader transformation. Microsoft, and the tech sector as a whole, is clearly prioritizing AI, even if that means reshaping work in ways that feel deeply unsettling for many employees.

Title: Why Can’t Oracle Afford Data Centers?

Read By Tl;dr – Oracle remains the x-axis of AI/cloud computing (but their revenue forecasts are geometric) Update: Oracle reported earnings yesterday, missing on both revenue and profit expectations and reporting slower growth than the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Free cash flow dropped deeper into the red. Oracle’s CAPEX spend dropped from $9.2 billion to $8.5 billion. But they announced they have signed contracts for nearly geometric increases in cloud revenue over the next five years, going from $10.3 billion in the last fiscal year (FY25) to $144 billion in FY30. The stock is up insanely as a result. The discussion of the CAPEX required to realize these revenue forecasts was minimal. Oracle guided to $35 billion in CAPEX for FY26 and threw around some words about how they’re “asset pretty light”. Oracle’s belief in magic beans abides. But no infrastructure, no revenue remains an iron law of the cloud world. Oracle still needs to come up with a lot of capital for CAPEX, amidst other demands for capital (dividends, buybacks to raise Larry’s stake, servicing debt). Oracle’s future is tied to Open AI. The vast majority of the forecasted revenue would come from Open AI. It isn’t clear how Open AI will find hundreds of billions to pay for infrastructure and all their other ambitions. The other customers referenced are neither big nor reliable revenue. xAI has no revenue, no prospects for real revenue, and is already turning to debt funding (plus borrowing from SpaceX). Meta has no business plan to pay for their ($600 billion and counting!) AI mulligan, but likely promised some very expensive employees they’d have GPUs to play with. NVIDIA and AMD paying Oracle for infrastructure is simply revenue recycling. Oracle still has to come up with the cash to play this game. They’re promised the revenue. Now they need to show us the CAPEX to realize that revenue. Update 2: WSJ confirms the vast majority of Oracle’s promised future revenue ($300 billion) would come from Open AI. Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on Open AI’s ability to raise hundreds of billions in more capital. Update 3: I just went ahead and wrote another post about Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Beyond bombastically scripted earnings calls, deploying CAPEX effectively and efficiently at scale takes place in a cold, hard reality. We’ve been chronicling Oracle’s difficulties building data centers at bonsai scale, never mind at hyperscale: Oracle (company slogan: “that’s not just a rack, it’s an entire region!”) has slowly increased its CAPEX spend, but at a pace that falls further and further behind the hyperCAPEX companies. Oracle’s first decent-sized data center, the oft-touted yet somehow still under construction project in Abilene, is well on its way to becoming the picture accompanying the dictionary definition of “construction site”. Partly it earns that status because it has taken so long, but also because that data center has so many mouths to feed (Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure, Lancium, Crusoe, Oracle, and Open AI are all laying claim to those construction photos). Oracle’s primary contribution seems to consist of yelling at the contractors. Oracle is “all-in” on their data center plans, and has expended enormous energy to get themselves referred to as a “hyperscaler”. But are they really in the hyperscaler club? Let’s see how Oracle stacks up with actual hyperscalers. This is a high-stakes financial game requiring gargantuan resources and a broad array of competencies. When it comes to the metrics, Oracle always seems to play the role of the x-axis (a joke I never tire of and Oracle never manages to break away from that gravitational pull). Let’s look at some proxies for financial prowess: Oracle is the revenue runt of their aspirational litter. By a lot. Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is the runt, except for Meta who don’t have a cloud business. (One of the great mysteries of the universe is where Meta sees the return coming from its rapidly escalating infrastructure investment promises — $600 billion and counting!. Unlike our other contestants, they have no cloud services business and a checkered history serving developers. As with Elon, taking a dependency on Meta is high risk. Maybe Meta alone has glimpsed some new zero-to-one geyser of revenue that will pay for all those data centers? Regardless, and reluctantly returning to today’s topic at hand, Meta still has vastly more cash to play this game than Oracle). Three-for-three on runt status. Oracle does show leadership on one metric: the debt to equity ratio. They’re already carrying a much bigger debt load than their desired peer group, while also the company that could most use some credit. For free cash flow (cash flow minus CAPEX), Oracle is yet still again the runt. Oracle’s competitors are both spending much more on CAPEX and still have significant, positive free cash flow. And when we look at the most recent quarter, Oracle’s free cash flow went negative (-$394 million) as they ramped their CAPEX spend to (merely) $9 billion in the quarter. Now let’s look at CAPEX spending, that ultimate separator of clouds and clowns. Emphatically runty. Oracle is already more stressed with their (modest) CAPEX spend relative to revenue. Cumulative CAPEX spending gives us a sense of how much infrastructure a company has deployed. Amazon, AWS, Google, Meta and Microsoft all spent more on CAPEX in the last year than Oracle has in the last decade, and all but Meta spent more last year on CAPEX than Oracle has in its entire fifty year existence. All of which is to say Oracle is both way behind in deployed infrastructure and playing with the smallest stack of chips in this game. Which brings me (at long last!) to my point: Oracle has hyped big revenue growth forecasts for the next couple years. In particular, they tout a deal with Open AI to bring in as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue by FY28 (we’ll ignore the question of why Microsoft decided it didn’t want this business and discarded it to Oracle). If you’re excited about the revenue opportunity in front of Oracle, you also have to grapple with the costs of the infrastructure necessary to deliver that revenue. No infrastructure, no revenue. No CAPEX, no infrastructure. So where does the money for data center CAPEX come from and what are the implications for Oracle’s free cash flow, debt load and/or margins? They need to step up from their current (modest) levels of spending which are already stressing the company’s financials. It is pretty clear Oracle is not very efficient in its CAPEX spend. They’ve been publicly demonstrating they are early on the learning curve, struggling to forecast CAPEX spending a quarter out, much less years out. They’re also in a big hurry, and there is a YOLO infrastructure cost premium. Some hardware is scarce (GPUs, gas turbines). Costs and wait times for both interconnection and hardware delivery have widened, while the hyperCAPEX companies are both bigger buyers and got in the queues earlier. End-to-end, Oracle lacks a manufacturing machine that turns dollars into data centers efficiently and effectively at scale. Over the last three years, Oracle has spent between $1 and $2 of CAPEX per dollar of cloud infrastructure revenue. AWS CAPEX historically has been between 25 to 60% of revenue (and is ramping back up as they deploy AI infrastructure). We could also model CAPEX spend based on the incremental revenue it drives (new capacity allows new revenue), which makes that $30 billion revenue dream even more expensive (and remember those GPUs are short-lived, especially if you’re chasing the pre-training market). It looks like Oracle is going to lean more on OPM (Other People’s Money or perhaps Oracle Pleads for Money) for its CAPEX spending. The data center build team was hit in the recent Oracle layoffs. The Abilene data center is already a layer cake of financial participants. Stargate was briefly the OPM salvation, but it has “struggled to get out of the gate”. Open AI finds itself doing party rounds for both cash and electricity, raising billions of dollars instead of trillions, and scavenging for megawatts rather than gigawatts. Maybe those notoriously charitable financial actors will accept lower returns just to partner with notoriously charitable Oracle? Going the OPM route negatively impacts Oracle margins, architectural control, and time-to-market. How do Oracle’s hyperscaler hopes and dreams get bankrolled?
