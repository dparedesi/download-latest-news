Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the tangle of AI deals among tech giants could be signs of dangerous overinvestment in the developing technology. They outline three ways the bubble could pop. Samsung chairman Lee Jae-yong and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in Seoul on October 1 after agreeing to collaborate on OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project, This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own. So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, while Nvidia is investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also counts Microsoft as one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoft accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su has defended AMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expects there to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.” Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos called the current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned that “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reports estimate that AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalest notes that “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanova points out that after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreaking report from Apple suggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” A recent study from MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations considered had achieved zero return on investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently after telling Axios, “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy at McKinsey & Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbook reported that nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23% in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such as Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator, on AI startups and the mindboggling valuations of those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft, Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI is committed to investing $300 billion in computing power with Oracle over the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation has almost doubled from $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recent reporting by CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Another report says the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk have each raised concerns about the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model, provided a recent example of what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is not difficult to imagine a major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerful Washington Post op-ed, Bethany McLean poignantly recalls the overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” Yale Insights is produced by the Yale School of Management. © 2007-2025 Yale School of Management

Title: AI could wipe out 100 million US jobs – Bernie Sanders report

Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:20:07Z

Artificial intelligence and automation technologies pose a threat to nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released on Monday by Senator Bernie Sanders. The report suggests the disruption will be widespread, affecting both white- and blue-collar professions. According to Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, AI and automation could replace 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants, and 89% of fast food workers. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” The warning contrasts with the stance of the Trump administration, which has championed American leadership in AI development, arguing that losing the technological race to China poses a national security threat. In an opinion piece for Fox News accompanying the report, Sanders questioned the motives behind these massive investments, noting that “some of the very wealthiest people in the world,” including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, are pouring hundreds of billions into the technology. He warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” Sanders argued that the technology is being leveraged primarily to increase corporate profits and concentrate wealth, citing executives who have announced significant investments in automation concurrently with mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures. The senator warned that workers in manufacturing, trucking, and taxi services face a particularly severe impact from the rapid advancement of self-driving projects by automakers and tech companies. He also expressed skepticism that their goal was to uplift the “60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck” and believes the true driver is because “investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially.” The trend is already underway, with corporate giants Amazon and Walmart having eliminated tens of thousands of positions as they intensify automation.

Title: How AI Could Lift Productivity and GDP Growth

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania AI automation could sharply increase productivity by the early 2030s, according to a Penn Wharton Budget Model brief, which estimated the likely impact on 784 occupations. Kent Smetters Shankar Parameshwaran Fears over job losses in an AI-led economy have become more real and clearer than ever in recent months. Major companies including Walmart, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Ford and Lufthansa have announced layoffs or reconfigured roles, and plans for new hires in areas like robotics won’t offset those. A new brief by the Penn Wharton Budget Model brings into sharp relief both the macro outlook on productivity, and the potential micro-level impact of AI automation. Alex Arnon, PWBM’s director of policy analysis, produced the brief with research assistance from data analyst Vidisha Chowdhury. PWBM faculty director Kent Smetters directed the study; he is also Wharton professor of business economics and public policy. According to the brief, titled “The Projected Impact of Generative AI on Future Productivity Growth,” AI will increase productivity and GDP by 1.5% by 2035, nearly 3% by 2055, and 3.7% by 2075. AI’s strongest boost to productivity growth will occur in the early 2030s (0.2 percentage points in 2032), but it will eventually fade to leave a permanent growth effect of 0.04 percentage points annually as the economy adjusts to AI. “In about 40% of the employment in [the occupations we looked at], at least 50% of the tasks will be replaceable in the future,” Smetters said in a recent episode of Wharton’s This Week in Business podcast. (Listen to the episode.) “It’s not a small impact by any measure. This does not mean that these jobs are replaceable; it could mean that these jobs become more productive. More time and data are required to understand the full impact.” While noting that it is premature to project the impact of AI on the federal budget, the brief estimated that it could reduce federal deficits by $400 billion over the 10-year budget window between 2026 and 2035. The findings in the brief are based on a study of the automation potential in 784 occupations to gauge the implications for productivity growth. It builds on a task-based framework developed by MIT professor and Nobel economics laureate Daron Acemoglu, with a projected timeline for gen AI adoption based on the adoption path of comparable technologies such as the commercial web and cloud computing services. “This does not mean that these jobs are replaceable; it could mean that these jobs become more productive.”—Kent Smetters The brief analyzed the impact of the potential exposure to AI automation across both income groups and specific occupations. Among its key findings: The PWBM brief predicted that the adoption timeline for AI’s productivity-enhancing tools will be similar to those of other mass-market technologies such as the PC, the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing. With most of those earlier technologies, adoption rose sharply in the first decade, with 40-50% of workers using them, but it slowed sharply in the next decade. The use of gen AI in 2024 suggested a faster adoption rate than previous technologies. Smetters cited PWBM’s Arnon, who supervised the PWBM brief, as noting that AI’s impact across occupations will be similar to how email changed how people communicate. “But it’s not a magic bullet either. It’s not electricity, it’s not refrigeration — it’s not that transformative.” “AI is not a magic bullet. It’s not electricity, it’s not refrigeration — it’s not that transformative.”— Kent Smetters The study’s projections are already beginning to show up in employment patterns. Job growth has stagnated in occupations with the most AI automation potential. Jobs that AI can completely replace saw a sharp fall in employment between 2021 and 2024 (0.75%), although these account for just about 1% of the total employment. Employment growth has slowed significantly for other occupations with high exposure to AI automation, where the technology can automate 90-99% of the tasks. In the future, gen AI tools will be used in more and more tasks exposed to AI productivity gains, alongside advancements in the technology and cost savings for employers, the brief stated. The share of economic activity exposed to AI will also grow faster than the rest of the economy, it added. Smetters cautioned against expecting AI to fix everything for the economy. “There’s this belief among policymakers that in this new era of AI, we don’t have to be fiscally responsible because AI is going to solve everything,” he said. “That’s simply not true. We’re not even close.” “AI is having a very big and salient impact [on stock values],” Smetters said. Barring the Magnificent Seven stocks (Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), which are the biggest AI adopters, earnings expectations haven’t changed much for 493 of the S&P 500 stocks, he added, citing a note by Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Companies may prepare for AI with varying degrees of optimism or skepticism, but they don’t have the option of ignoring it. “When you have really unusual transformative technology like [AI], you have two macro choices: You’re going to either lean into it, embrace it, and figure out how to make your customer experience better and shape it, or you can wish it away and have it happen to you,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a recent CNBC interview.

Title: The Trouble with Tech Companies (and Their Strategies)

A conversation with writer Cory Doctorow about why tech companies seem to deprioritize users. Cory Doctorow, author and digital rights advocate, argues that big tech companies from Facebook to Google and beyond have evolved – or devolved – in a disappointing way. He says that many large tech companies begin with a good product, but that over time they prioritize first business customers, and then ultimately shareholders and profits over end users. That creates a decline in service quality, and Doctorow explains why that’s bad for customers, companies, and the broader economy and society. Doctorow wrote the new book Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It. ADI IGNATIUS: I am Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: So Alison, there are times when someone puts their finger on something that we sense and that we experience, but we don’t yet have a word for. ALISON BEARD: Such as? ADI IGNATIUS: Well, Clay Christensen did that with disruption. The term is overused now to refer to almost any business challenge, but his definition was very precise. When newcomers start at the bottom of the market, win customers there and innovate up the value chain to displace the incumbent. So now Cory Doctorow, a well-known tech writer, has put his finger on another phenomenon that did not have a name, and that is the gradual evolution, he would say deterioration of tech platforms. So Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and so on. We fall in love with them, but they evolve into something we fall out of love with, but we’re kind of stuck in their world and he calls that the enshitification of these services. Okay, this is not a family-friendly term, but it was picked as the word of the year by a couple of big dictionaries. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. That is definitely not a word that I’m very comfortable saying, even though I can generally swear with the best of them. But I do know exactly what you’re talking about, and I think it happens in lots of areas. There’s a product or service or platform as you say, that starts really great and then gets worse over time because the organization, whether it’s public or private, becomes less focused and complacent. In a perfect world, the market would punish them for that. There would be clay as disruptors and consumers or business clients could take their money elsewhere. But I guess if they’re dominant in their corner of the industry or their geography, that’s sometimes not feasible. So I’d love to know if there’s a solution. ADI IGNATIUS: So that’s what we’re talking about. So my guest this week is Cory Doctorow, journalist, writer, keen observer of the contemporary tech world, and author of the new book, Enshitification, Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It. So here’s our conversation. CORY DOCTOROW: I’ve worked for a digital rights group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which defends digital rights online, and I’ve been working for them for 24 years, all my adult life, and I have tried many ways of engaging people with these very abstract techno, social, political critiques of how our platforms are regulated and how they operate. It turns out that swearing was the secret that cracked the nut, that giving people a minor license to a bit of profanity makes them very happy and lets them go out and do it. So enshitification at its crux is a description of how platforms decay backed by theory of why they decay. Platforms are first good to their end users. They lure those end users in, they find a locus of lock-ins, so the users can’t readily leave once those users are locked in, they make things worse for those end users in order to tempt in business customers. One way to think about this that’s very straightforward is Facebook went from promising users they would never spy on them, to spying on them a lot. Having locked in those business customers, they then abuse those business customers as well. And the end goal is to draw out all surplus value allocated to shareholders and executives and create an equilibrium where there’s just the minimum homeopathic residue of value left to keep users locked in and then keep business customers locked to users, and to return all surplus value to shareholders and executives. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, now surely we must have some agency here. I mean, why can’t we just leave the platforms when we agree that they’ve gotten lousy? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, that’s where the lock-in comes in. And maybe I’ll work backwards here and talk about lock-in of business customers. So we have got a lot of discursive and theoretical attention on monopoly, powerful sellers. But we don’t pay a lot of attention to monopsony, which is powerful buyers. If you operate a firm, you understand that if a customer accounts for, say, 20 or 30% of your turnover, and they just stop doing business with you overnight, that is catastrophic. Anyone who’s ever done business with Walmart knows what this looks like. But also everyone who’s still putting videos on YouTube as they crank down the compensation to creators knows what this looks like. It’s very hard to escape a powerful buyer. But in terms of consumer lock-in, there’s many different ways of accomplishing it. This is, I think the primary source of innovation in Silicon Valley is finding ways to lock in end users. So you can do it in concert with the state. Since 1998, America has had a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. And Section 1201 of the DMCA establishes a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence in a $500,000 fine for defeating an access control. And so if there’s software in a device, and the only way to modify it is to bypass something that says, don’t modify this software, the act of modifying the software, even if you don’t infringe anyone’s copyright, even if you don’t violate anyone’s law, is a felony that you can go to jail for five years for. And so this is how you get lock in with printer ink. So the companies have merged to a cartel. Four giant companies control all the printers. They have fitted the printer cartridges with security chips that are a software lock and access control, and it checks to see whether you’re using an OEM cartridge with the original ink in it or whether you’ve refilled or bought a third party ink cartridge. And what this does is it creates a switching cost where if you want to leave your printer behind and go to one that takes third party ink, if you can find it, because the cartel have crushed those printer companies, you have to surrender all the ink that’s remaining in your other three toner cartridges and the cost of the printer as well. And so, a lot of users don’t switch, because at any given moment, the kind of economically rational thing is to stick with the printer. And so we see printer ink monotonically increasing in price. And today printer ink is the most expensive fluid you can buy as a civilian without obtaining a government permit. But it’s not just this kind of technological or state lock-in. You have Uber, which was able to violate the black letter of antitrust law by doing predatory pricing, selling goods below cost in order to remove competitors from the market. They lost 41 cents on every dollar they made for 13 years, and they crushed all potential competitors except for an also ran, which is Lyft. And so in many places now the bus isn’t coming, there isn’t a regular taxi company and it’s just Uber. And so Uber raises the price and what are you going to do? ADI IGNATIUS: So you mentioned Facebook, why don’t you talk whether it’s about Facebook or another platform, sort of step-by-step, how a platform, we fall in love with it for good reason, and then something happens? So talk in more detail about how a platform goes from great stuff to crappy stuff. CORY DOCTOROW: So when Facebook started off as a public service, they had a problem, which was that everyone who could have been using Facebook and who wanted social media already had a social media account on another service called MySpace. And so they made a pitch to them. They said, “Come to Facebook. We are like MySpace except that we will never spy on you and we’ll never show you anything you didn’t ask to see. So that was stage one. So as those end users piled into Facebook, they did Facebook’s work for them. They found a way to lock themselves in, and they did so through something economists called the collective action problem. When there’s 200 of you and you’re all stuck to Facebook, and some of you’re there because that’s where the people have the same rare disease as them meet, and some of you’re there because that’s how they plan the carpool for the league their kids are in, and some are there because they emigrated, and that’s the only way to stay in touch with the people they left back home. And some are there because that’s how they find their audience or their customers. Then the fact that you are dissatisfied with Facebook has to overwhelm the fact that you are very much dependent on your friends, and so long as you love your friends more than you hate Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg can make things worse for you in order to make things better for another group of users. So that’s where stage two starts. We draw down some of the value that has been given to end users in order to allocate it to a different group of users. The business customers, in Facebook’s case that was publishers and advertisers. So Mark Zuckerberg violates his promises and he goes to the advertisers and he says, “Do you remember when these rubes signed up for Facebook? We told them we weren’t going to spy on them. The actual fact is we spy on them with every hour that God sends, and for a remarkably small amount of money, we will target ads to them with incredible fidelity. We will devote enormous resources to make sure that when you give us a dollar to show an ad to a specific kind of user, that is the kind of user, and they definitely get shown the ad before you get billed.” So that business customers they pile in too, and they become dependent on those end users because very quickly Facebook becomes a critical source of business to their firms and they can’t replace them overnight and they can’t afford to go away. So that’s stage two. In stage three, Facebook exploits the fact that business customers and end users are all locked together, and so it starts to withdraw value from both of them in order to allocate it to shareholders and investors. So if you’re an advertiser, you find that the price of advertising has gone way up, but the fidelity of ad targeting has gone way down. So advertising costs go up, ad fraud goes through the roof. In 2017, Procter & Gamble zeroed out their programmatic advertising spend. They had been spending $200 million a year on surveillance ads or programmatic ads, and when they went to zero, they saw a 0% drop in sales, because to a first approximation, P&G’s ads were either not being seen by anyone, it was just being consumed by ad fraud, or they were being seen by the wrong people. They were just being misdirected by indifferently tended ad targeting systems. Publishers also faced rising costs, so they had to put longer and longer excerpts just to be shown to their own subscribers. And to get recommended that, excerpts had to be longer still and nothing would show up if they put a link back to their own website. And Facebook said, “Oh, we can’t tell if those are malicious links,” with the effect that they become commodity back end suppliers to Facebook. The stuff they post is perfectly substitutive for the material on their own website. Meanwhile, end users have found that the share of content that they’ve asked to see in their feed is almost nonexistent, to create a void into which Facebook can stuff things people will pay to show them to see. That’s the end of it. Stage three enshitification. ADI IGNATIUS: This is great analysis, and it’s a little bit like Clay Christensen with disruption theory that’s very specific, and your analysis is very specific to what happens with platforms. I’m wondering, to what extent should our listeners care? I mean, I think most of us have a deal with the internet where we say, all right, I’m not comfortable with every aspect of it. I’m maybe not comfortable with the surveillance aspect of it, but it’s working for me. I mean, there’s some trade-off of convenience versus the negative stuff. So yeah, I wish it were better, but it’s working fine for me. Why should our listeners care? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, I think increasingly it’s not working for people. So in a way that I think most people can relate to, Google with a 90% search market who were just allowed to go on by federal judge, given permission to go on paying Apple $20 billion a year not to enter the search market, with a competitor that might impose discipline on them, even having lost an antitrust case. I think we all understand that our gateway to knowledge on the internet kind of sucks now, but there are ways that this becomes much more pointed. So nurses, contract nurses are very common in America, because hospitals are trying to do union avoidance. And it used to be that contract nurses were supplied by local firms, several local firms in every market, and now they’ve been replaced by, depending on how you count, three or four giant apps, each of which calls itself Uber for nurses. And because the monopolies capture their regulators, those giant apps are able to violate the privacy of those nurses in ways that shifts giant amounts of money from labor to capital. So before a shift is given to a nurse, the app buys their credit history from a data broker. Data brokers are unregulated in America. Under Biden, we got a rule regulating them. Under Trump, that rule was rescinded. And the last time Congress gave us a law about this, a consumer privacy law was in 1988, when the Video Privacy Protection Act banned video store clerks from disclosing your VHS rental history. We haven’t had a single new consumer privacy law since then. And so they’re able to buy the credit history of nurses, and they are looking for how much credit card debt the nurses are carrying, and how delinquent it is. And the more economically desperate you are, the lower the wage you’re offered. And so this is very bad for nurses, clearly, but if you’re getting a catheter inserted today by a nurse who had to drive Uber till midnight the night before in order to make rent and couldn’t afford breakfast this morning, that’s bad for you too. ADI IGNATIUS: So doesn’t everything get worse? I mean, we’re looking at these platforms in and say, “Man, it’s getting…” Is this really unique to internet platforms? Obviously the details are specific to them, but isn’t this things get worse over time or capitalism leads to exploitation over time? Is this really unique to tech companies and what they’ve created? CORY DOCTOROW: There are sources of discipline on firms that used to operate on firms and that I argue have ceased to operate on firms. So historically, firms had to worry about competitors, but we have seen since the Carter years, a drawdown of antitrust law, with the exception of late Trump one and the Biden years where we saw revival of it. And that has allowed firms to just buy each other and eliminate competitors, so they don’t have to worry about you leaving. So the most obvious example of this would be Facebook buying Instagram. And so we don’t have competitors as a source of discipline. And when firms when they cartelize, when there’s only like five of them or four or three or two or one, they find it really easy to come to an agreement about what their lobbying posture is going to be. So think of Uber and Lyft agreeing to spend $225 million collectively on Prop 22 here in California that formalize the worker misclassification they do to treat employees as contractors. These companies may be competitors in some sense, but not when it comes to talking to regulators or getting policy over the line. And so all of that stuff, that acts on every firm. One company called Luxottica Esselor has bought every brand of eyeglasses you’ve ever heard of. And every place you buy glasses, from Sunglass Hut to Lenscrafters. And they’ve raised the price of glasses over the last 10 years, so they’ve gotten worse. So what’s the difference between glasses and computers or technology? It’s that there were other forces of discipline that worked on tech platforms, and that those forces of discipline that were tech specific also went away. And those two forces, one is that the tech workforce was historically very powerful because they were scarce, and a lot of them, I call them Tron-pilled, they fought for the user. Tech worker scarcity has gone away, we saw half million layoffs in the sector in the last three years. And then the other one is a very interesting one called interoperability, which is making a technology that makes another technology work better. That used to be the order of the day. If a company made its technology worse, someone else would make a technology that made it better and steal your customers from you. But the growth of IP law has neutralized that as well. So the erosion of discipline has led to the worsening of things. It’s not the iron laws of economics or the great forces of history, it’s specific policy choices that were predicted to have this outcome and that did have this outcome. ADI IGNATIUS: You don’t write much in the book about AI and I think you’re right, the Google search is… We would’ve imagined several years ago that Google search would be much better than it’s, and in your book you talk about some of the reasons why it’s intentionally not as good as it could be. But AI for all its limitations, for all its factual mistakes, it’s pretty good. I think AI search is pretty good and certainly better than classic Google search at this point. Do you think AI providers are likely to go through the same process or that maybe AI gives us an alternative, gives us agency amid some of these problems here? CORY DOCTOROW: I think that we have to understand that the investment in AI, which is extraordinary, the indisputably extraordinary, has been driven by exactly one thing, and it’s not making cool pictures. It’s not AI search. It’s the prospect of displacing labor. When Gartner says there’s $13 trillion in AI, what they mean is that there’s 13 trillion in wages that can be shifted from labor to capital. That’s foundationally what they’re talking about. And while there’s lots of other stuff going on, I think we have to keep our eyes on the prize. And I think that it’s important to note that whatever merit AI has for search or anything else, it’s actually not very good at doing people’s jobs. Like AI salesmen are much better at convincing a boss to fire a worker and replace them with an AI that can’t do their job, than AI is at doing that worker’s job, partly because they’re pushing on an open door. Bosses would love to reduce their wage bills. That is the first characteristic of being a boss, is to find ways to reduce your wage bills, because it’s an input that is something that feels like you should be able to reduce it through automation. As to whether AI is going to make this better or worse, I think mostly it’s going to make it worse. One of the use cases where AI really is very good is surveillance pricing. It’s really good at figuring out how to tighter an offer on a per user basis, whether that’s a wage offer or a pricing offer to find the minimum you’re willing to accept as a worker and the maximum you’re willing to pay as a customer. I think it’s just a pure transfer from consumers and workers. ADI IGNATIUS: Let’s get to the part of this conversation that is, all right, so what do we do about it? There are various approaches. There’s what policymakers can do, there’s what users can do. There’s what businesses that are part of these two-sided platforms can do. How about we start with businesses who appreciate your argument and say, “Yes, we’ve lost power, we’ve lost agency, we’re not happy.” I mean, your P&G example, we’re spending all this money and getting nothing in return. What can business do to try to change all of this? CORY DOCTOROW: Well, I have to say, I don’t think there’s much businesses or individuals can do. This is a policy question. I mean, what can businesses do? They can shift the policy landscape. One of the things we have to recognize is that Chamber of Commerce is extraordinarily bad at representing the interests of SMEs and often lobbies for things that SMEs owners are extremely hostile to, in order to please its largest members. And those largest members are predatory upon SMEs. But there are some large enterprises that have taken big swings at changing the policy landscape. And the best example I can think of here is Epic, makers of the video game Fortnite. Epic has sued both in the EU and the US, Google and Apple with mixed success, but some stunning successes including a federal case against Google, rather for antitrust violations. It’s going to benefit every SME that uses those platforms as having 30 cents taken out of every dollar they make in processing fees. Often the local chambers of commerce are better, and they need to find industry associations that don’t incorporate the monopolists that prey on them and that are seeking to collect rents from them, because they have these choke points in the economy. Because you can’t clear the choke point just by having a better product. If you do retail business and you want to reach customers in America, 90% of affluent households have Prime, and 90% of Prime households start their search on Amazon. If they find what they’re looking for, they don’t shop anywhere else, which means that you must be on Amazon to reach those customers. Amazon’s taking 45 to 51 cents out of every platform dollar generated by third party sellers. They take so much out of sellers that they don’t have to pay anything for Prime for their own package fulfillment. They have 100% subsidy on Amazon package fulfillment, how many businesses can really operate on a 45 to 51% margin? And on top of that, Amazon has now, it used to be an explicit, now it’s a tacit most favored nation principle where if you sell more cheaply anywhere other than Amazon, Amazon buries you in the search results on page 11 million, which means that if you raise your prices on Amazon to make up for the 45 to 51 cents that you’re spending at every dollar and platform fees, you’ve got to also raise your prices at Walmart, Target and your warehouse store. Otherwise, Amazon will effectively delist you and then you won’t reach 90% of American consumers. You can’t fix that by having a better product or better product messaging or better pricing. The only way you can fix that is with private rights of action in antitrust law and industrial associations that back them. ADI IGNATIUS: And are you optimistic that any of that could happen? You and I know the U.S. best in the U.S. in this climate. CORY DOCTOROW: Well, the U.S. has certainly done a lot of backsliding. For four years under Biden, we had a lot of focus on SMEs and fairness for SMEs at the expense of these big rent-seeking platforms, and that’s all been rolled back. What’s happening that’s very interesting though, is that under the last years of Trump one and under Biden, and I know you want to talk about America, but internationally in Canada, the EU, Australia, Japan, South Korea and China, we’ve seen this really muscular new wave of enforcement against large firms since 2019. And political science has no explanation for it, because it’s a bedrock of political science that if you examine policy outcomes, that they universally and exclusively reflect the preferences of the largest firms and the richest people. It literally doesn’t matter how popular something is with the public, if billionaires don’t like it never happens. And this is kind of the first time that’s happened in generations. And so something amazing is happening in our political landscape. This is, it’s like gravity started working in reverse and no one’s noticed, and no one even has investigated the causes of it. I am both baffled and heartened by this, because something has changed everywhere in a way that no one can explain, and that is really to the betterment of everyone who wants a fair and more open society, even as the outward signs are getting more closed and less fair. This tailwind, which is blowing so ferociously in the sales of policymakers all over the world, coming from somewhere, it’s coming. I think from if you’re in finance, you’ll know Stein’s law, anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop. It’s coming from having reached the limits of rent extraction and neo-feudalism, and there just being some inchoate force that’s changing things. ADI IGNATIUS: You’ve studied technology and you’ve studied the people who own the big technology firms. I still don’t entirely understand why some of these very idealistic people who created technologies, in fact, to make the world a better place, to find the source of all knowledge or to connect people they brought labor in who were part of the mission. So then at some point, they become CEOs of these companies and not only want to succeed, but want to destroy. Want to monopolize, want to wipe out, want to maximize everything you’re talking about. How does that happen? How do these people who invent something magical and idealistic in their garages, all it seems evolve into the worst kind of almost cartoonish predatory capitalists? How does that happen? CORY DOCTOROW: Many of our social structures are oriented around the tacit or even the explicit idea that we’re really good at kidding ourselves, that we’re really good at rationalizing our way into trouble. The scientific method, the reason you’d expose your findings to adversarial peer review where you let people who hate you and want you to fail, find the mistakes you’ve made is because it’s really easy to kid yourself that the reason you didn’t get the result you expected was because you made a mistake in the experiment and not because you were wrong and to just fudge your results. You read Adam Smith and he’s like, the greediest bastards alive will make something good for you if they fear that they will be ruined if they don’t. It is not through the generosity of the baker that we expect our bread. It is through his self-regard, because in a market society where there are competitors the baker knows that if he puts gravel and rat poison in the bread, that you’re going to buy your bread somewhere else, even if he can save a lot of money doing it that way. So what we did was we removed the sources of discipline. Being shriven of all sources of discipline allows your stupidest ideas to conquer your life. ADI IGNATIUS: So having written this book, having gotten it out, are you feeling more hopeful or more pessimistic about the future of the internet? CORY DOCTOROW: Hope and pessimism are not opposites. Optimism and pessimism are the belief that things are just going to happen no matter what, and humans don’t have a role in them. They’re both fatalism. Hope does not mean that you think things will go well. It means that you can see a way to make them better, and you have the epistemic humility to say, even though I don’t know what I will do after I make things a little better, I am willing to count into the possibility that if I change my vantage point by ascending the gradient towards a better future, even just a little, that there may be terrain that I can’t perceive or even imagine that will be revealed to me as I get further up that gradient, and then I’ll know what to do next. And I have tons of hope right now, because I think so many possibilities are opening up in terms of things we do next because of international enforcement.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/06/2025 5:36:18 PM PDT by marcusmaximus Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant and eight other major corporations have been questioned by U.S. Senators for filing thousands of H-1B skilled labour visa petitions after conducting "mass layoffs" of American employees. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The Senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. -snip- "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the U.S. on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions."

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Lee and Harris Introduce Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act February 7, 2019 WASHINGTON – Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act Wednesday, a bill that would remove per-country caps for employment-based green cards. “Immigrants should not be penalized due to their country of origin,” Sen. Lee said. “Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in a other areas.” “Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Sen. Harris said. “We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the U.S. and continue to contribute to the economy. I’m proud to join with Senator Lee on this bipartisan legislation to ensure that our country remains vibrant and dynamic.” The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act also increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7 percent to 15 percent. Without adding any new green cards, S. 386 creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is additionally cosponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Jim Moran (R-KS), Tom Carper (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maria Cantwell D-WA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Krysten Sinema (D-AZ). The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Microsoft, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others. https://www.lee.senate.gov/2019/2/sens-lee-and-harris-introduce-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act 17 posted on 10/06/2025 6:55:09 PM PDT by marcusmaximus [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus Add Cisco, Adobe, Fidelity to that list.

Title: AI could wipe out 100M US jobs – from nurses to truck drivers – over the next decade: report

Artificial intelligence and automation could wipe out nearly 100 million jobs in the US over the next decade, according to a report released by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) on Monday. The analysis – ironically based on ChatGPT findings – found the new tech could erase jobs from a wide range of fields, including white- and blue-collar roles. AI, automation and robotics could hit 40% of registered nurses, 47% of truck drivers, 64% of accountants, 65% of teaching assistants and 89% of fast food workers, according to Sanders, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions. “The agricultural revolution unfolded over thousands of years. The industrial revolution took more than a century,” the report said. “Artificial labor could reshape the economy in less than a decade.” Debates over AI regulation have been heating up in Washington.

Never miss a story. The Trump administration has argued that the US should lead the world in AI development, claiming it could pose a national security threat if China wins the race. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are calling for increased regulation on the sector – as well as worker protections like a 32-hour workweek and a “robot tax” on companies switching to automation. Amazon and Walmart – two of the largest publicly-traded US companies by revenue – have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs as they have leaned into automation efforts. In an op-ed for Fox News on Monday, Sanders warned that the “artificial intelligence and robotics being developed by these multi-billionaires today will allow corporate America to wipe out tens of millions of decent-paying jobs, cut labor costs and boost profits.” He argued that AI is simply being used as a tool to further concentrate wealth, nodding to CEOs who have invested billions into automation while announcing mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures. Sanders warned of a devastating hit to workers in the manufacturing industry, as well as truck, bus and taxi drivers, as automakers and tech startups increasingly ramp up their self-driving projects. “Some of the very wealthiest people in the world, including Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos – are now investing hundreds of billions into these revolutionary technologies,” Sanders wrote in his op-ed. “Why is that? Is it because they want to improve the standard of living of the 60% of our people who live paycheck-to-paycheck – Americans who are struggling to pay for groceries, healthcare, housing and education? Maybe. But I doubt it.” “I think it’s because investing in AI and robotics will increase their wealth and power exponentially,” he continued. Advertisement

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mkvtw6t3n Share article Print article There is a buzz of anticipation around Chris Kraus’ latest novel The Four Spent the Day Together, following the success of the television adaption of her postmodern feminist cult classic I Love Dick (1997). Review: The Four Spent the Day Together – Chris Kraus (Scribe) Kraus’ novels to this point have all been self-referential. The typical Kraus novel, as she recently explained, provides a fictionalised “case study of my life”. She writes what literary academic Mira Mattar calls “unconstrained, disobedient texts”, using “her own most immediately available raw material”. Though Kraus resists the term “autofiction”, she is interested in testing the limits of memoir, unsettling fact and fiction to deliver provocative commentaries on contemporary American culture. Her work combines high and low cultural elements with postmodern play, drawing on influences such as philosopher Jean Baudrillard and writer Kathy Acker, about whom she has written a landmark biography. This time, however, Kraus has added a true-crime twist, a move that changes the stakes of her novel’s biting social commentary. The Four Spent the Day Together is arguably Kraus’s most conceptually ambitious, formally interesting, and politically charged novel to date. Written in three historically overlapping sections, spanning the 1960s to the 2020s, it pursues new directions for her writing. The novel traces the tensions of everyday life in a declining global superpower. Its themes range from the rise of neoliberal greed, gentrification and the prison-industrial complex, to the toxic cloud of reactionary politics, censorship and cancel-culture that has settled over a twitterised America, including its literary culture. The Four Spent the Day Together initially presents itself as the story of an artist named Catt Greene – Kraus’ fictional alter ego, who is also the author of a book called I Love Dick. Readers will recall her from Kraus’ 2012 novel Summer of Hate (where she is named Catt Dunlop). The first section reads as a coming-of-age novel about Catt’s rebellious teenage years growing up in Milford, Connecticut. The second section is a work of thinly veiled autofiction about the pressures of Catt’s life as a middle-aged writer married to a recovering addict. In its final section, The Four Spent the Day Together becomes a “true-crime novel”. The move allows Catt to decentre herself, write about issues that fall well outside her usual field of vision as an artist. She sees parallels between her life and some teenagers involved in a meth-fuelled murder case. In exposing the similarities, Kraus deftly allegorises how poverty, racism and political corruption produce cycles of inequality for working-class Americans. Beginning in Milford during the turbulent 1960s, The Four Spent the Day Together adopts that era’s key slogan. It shows how “the personal is political”. Kraus reflects on the gentrification of Brooklyn, which prices Catt’s parents out of their working-class neighbourhood. The family moves to suburban Milford, where extreme economic inequality also predominates, despite the differences from the city. Catt’s father spends most of his days away at work in Cambridge University Press’s Manhattan office. Her mother remains at home caring for their two children, a housewife suffering from what second-wave feminist Betty Friedan called the “unspoken” problem haunting middle-class white women. Her sister Carla is struggling with a misdiagnosed developmental disability, which the precocious Catt openly resents, leading her to act out. Swept up in her generation’s spirit of rebelliousness, Catt becomes involved in the counterculture of sit-ins, drugs, motorcycles and radical politics. The novel then lurches forward in time to focus on Catt’s career as a writer and creative-writing professor, and on her relationships. Politics again rears its head in the characters’ everyday lives. Catt and her first husband, an older French philosophy professor (a principal character in I Love Dick), protest against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s infernal war in the Middle East and the reign of “antiterrorist” terror – one agenda of which was to crush political dissent by policing antiwar protesters. Political solidarity draws Catt to her second husband Paul Garcia (who also appears in Summer of Hate). Paul has served a trumped-up three-year prison sentence following a drug-fuelled crime spree, in which he stole $900 from a corporation Cheney had invested in. Catt and her first husband sponsor Paul to undertake a psychology degree, as he struggles to turn his life around. As Catt’s open marriage withers, she and Paul purchase a vacation house in rural Balsam, Minnesota: the land of Bob Dylan’s North Country Blues. Catt hopes to secure a creative retreat from the bustle of Los Angeles. Paul seeks a refuge from the difficulties of his social work in the city’s poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods. The longer they spend in the sublimely beautiful landscape of northern Minnesota, the more they become exposed to its dark enigmas. Once an iron-ore powerhouse, the post-industrial Iron Range is now a region in decline. Clinging to myths of a lost era of prosperity, it has become a MAGA stronghold of deeply encrusted conservatism, stark economic inequalities and rampant addiction. An epidemic of methamphetamines (or “hillbilly heroin” as it was dubbed in the 2000s) has spiralled out of control. The locale proves unhelpful to Paul’s recovery. A shift to his perspective in this section is crucial for the novel’s personalisation of politics. Paul is a working-class American from a racial minority and a mental health support worker. His life has been one of hardship. His perspective ties the book’s threads of political commentary together. A harrowing career counselling troubled youths and addicts, while struggling with his own recovery from addiction, leads him into a downward spiral: drink-driving offences, job layoffs and marital breakdown. The novel’s final section, set in the late 2010s, finds Catt grappling with the prospect of a second divorce. At this point, she learns of a murder trial in nearby Hibbing, Minnesota. Three teenagers are accused of conspiring to murder an acquaintance while under the influence of crystal meth. Their families, law enforcement, the community, Catt, and even the suspects themselves fail to understand their motives. Attempting to escape her personal and professional troubles, Catt becomes obsessed with the investigating the case. Rather than focus on the innocence or guilt of the accused, she studies their childhood experiences of poverty, broken homes, abuse and undiagnosed disability. In preparing this novel, Kraus conducted over 100 interviews with individuals who were in some way connected to the crime. It is worth noting that her publisher has heavily promoted this final section, going so far as to call The Four Spent the Day Together a “true crime” novel, even though this subplot does not materialise until the final third of the book. What is the upshot of this sudden detour into “true-crime fiction”? What are the implications of thinking about the book in this way? “Crimes are like books,” Kraus reflected in a recent interview, in that a “crime brackets life in the same way that a novel brackets time, and within the brackets you can start to study different flows”. This can lead to “a belated understanding of the whole systemic injustice that led to the situation in the first place”. Reading backwards from this point, we might trace how Kraus’s has plotted her personal history in a way that foreshadows the novel’s turning point. First, she probes her family’s troubles with depression and disability, and her own youthful experiments with recreational drugs and petty crime. Then she considers the difficulties of living with a spouse who is attempting to turn his life around but is caught at every turn, stigmatised as a felon and addict within a judicial system that racially profiles him. By refocusing the story around the lives of a group of kids before and after they commit an atrocious crime, Kraus challenges herself to “see things from the character’s point of view, not my point of view” in order to “psychically penetrate the mindscape of these kids and how they see things”. Incorporating investigative materials into a literary reconstruction of those characters and events, she explores the parallels between her history and theirs. What can a grisly meth-fuelled murder in northern Minnesota’s Iron Range tell us about post-industrial decline and the malaises of drug addiction, poverty and rising right-wing conservatism? Taking a leaf out of Truman Capote’s book (specifically, his “non-fiction novel” In Cold Blood), Kraus blends journalism with autofiction to explore how these characters’ lives are contoured by historical ruptures brought about by political struggles. Catt’s investigations into what pushed three teenagers to murder an acquaintance in cold blood lead to more urgent questions regarding what has gone so terribly wrong in American life. In a sense, Kraus is not writing a book about a crime, but about what a crime can teach us about what books do. For if books are like crimes, as she claims, then writing can be understood as means of “investigating things” by “looking a little deeper than people look in the course of an anesthetized daily life”. “The pleasure of reading is that the writer has looked that far and is telling you things that you either didn’t know or you knew in some subliminal way,” she explains. “The function of writing is to give thoughts and feelings a voice, and to bring them forward to articulate them.” On one level, the unexpected third section of the novel is Kraus using “true-crime fiction” to expose her culture’s inability to grapple with these sorts of issues. Kraus’ cult following includes major contemporary writers such as Sheila Heti, Rachel Kushner and Maggie Nelson, as well as celebrities Lena Dunham and Alexa Chung. But some readers will likely not agree with all Kraus has to say. She is razor-sharp about literary critics, within a wider satire of cultural criticism in the age of social media. Through Catt, Kraus also reflects on the strange consequences of becoming famous after the television adaptation of I Love Dick. At first, Catt is regarded as a trailblazing “older white feminist” and a forebear of the #MeToo movement. But she soon draws ire for refusing to boycott a Los Angeles artists’ collective accused of tacitly supporting the gentrification of working-class Chicano suburbs. Kraus here turns her satirical gaze back onto privileged but unaware Ivy League students and other commentators, who picketed her speaking events at NYU when she was promoting her Acker biography. In Summer of Hate, she wrote about her experiences investing in and restoring dilapidated apartment complexes in the 2000s. The project aimed at increasing decent and affordable housing for low-income families. In The Four Spent the Day Together, Catt (like Kraus) finds herself likened to coldblooded property investors like the Trump family – “slumlords” who profit from ruthless campaigns of racial redlining and gentrification (see Woody Guthrie’s classic song about the shady dealings and racism of his landlord Fred Trump for a concise account). Without knowing her, the protesters accuse Catt of “racially fetishising” her husband. Revisiting these scandals could, on one level, be dismissed as merely defensive. But Kraus also uses these uncomfortable experiences to develop an incisive social commentary on the toxic twitterisation of politics and culture. She draws attention to the contradictions and reactionary tendencies of social media and online communities, as well as the dangerous effects of censorship when these tendencies migrate into the sphere of literature and criticism. Kraus has said that, in writing this novel, she hoped it might provide “a window into what the culture and consciousness is outside of the intellectual worlds in mainstream America”. This is, she observed, “not something that’s looked at much in high art” in the United States. The Four Spent the Day Together, however, achieves precisely that. It culminates in a vision of cultural vacuity, rampant political corruption, overpolicing and mass incarceration – and public health and welfare systems that fail to provide adequate safety nets for individuals or support for communities in crisis. Instead of an autobiography with a true-crime novel tacked on, we are left with a sobering allegory of America’s contradictions and its longstanding political inequalities. Kraus describes how these have deepened and morphed into new, frightening shapes over the past 60 years. Provocative yet unflinching, The Four Spent the Day Together promises to ignite difficult conversations about what has led to the culture and politics of Trump’s America 2.0.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 1:36:33 PM PDT by marcusmaximus US senators Charles Grassley and Richard Durbin have raised concerns about major corporations, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Cognizant, for filing thousands of H-1B skilled worker visa petitions even as they conducted large-scale layoffs of American employees. Other companies questioned include Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart. The inquiry comes amid high unemployment in the US tech sector, which exceeds the overall national jobless rate. Recent American graduates with STEM degrees are reportedly struggling to find jobs, prompting the senators to question why companies are replacing US workers with foreign visa holders, as per PTI reports. Allegations Against TCS And Cognizant TCS announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including Americans, while applying to hire 5,505 foreign H-1B workers in 2025. The company is also under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly replacing older American staff with H-1B visa holders. Cognizant similarly laid off thousands of workers and applied for 2,493 H-1B employees. A 2024 federal jury found Cognizant favored South Asian H-1B workers over American staff, resulting in punitive damages. Other Tech Companies Under Scrutiny Amazon laid off tens of thousands of employees while applying for 10,044 H-1B visas. Google cut large numbers of employees, including managers, and applied for 4,181 foreign hires. Meta laid off 3,600 employees while applying for 5,123 H-1B workers. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees but applied for 5,189 H-1B visas despite reporting record profits. (Excerpt) Read more at timesnownews.com ...

There is no need to bring them to the US. They can work from India. Good point.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 11:16:50 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Sudden layoffs from jobs are tough to process and it gets worse when questions of employees remain unanswered. In one such case, an Indian employee detailed his sudden layoff from a US-based company in a Reddit post which has gone viral. According to the post, the employee was caught off guard by the termination, which took place on October 1, over a three-minute video call. “It was literally like any other day, woke up at 8:30, logged into work at 9 and saw a calendar invite for 11. It was a mandatory meeting with our COO for all India employees. I joined it at 11, he joined at 11:01, disabled everyone’s cameras and mics, casually let us know that they had “made the difficult decision of letting most of their Indian work force go”,’ the post read. The employee clarified that the layoffs were not performance-based but part of an internal organisational restructuring. ‘No time to prepare’ Sharing the emotional impact of the layoff, the Reddit post further stated that the three-minute video call left Indian employees “shocked, stunned, frustrated, stressed”. “No prior intimation, no time to prepare. They have offered October’s salary to paid at the end of the month and any leaves would be encashed. None of it even remotely makes up for what I’m feeling right now. This is the first time I’ve been laid off and it just truly…sucks,” read the post. (Excerpt) Read more at financialexpress.com ...

They didn’t want people screwing up airplanes as a frustration at an upcoming layoff. I was never laid off from Boeing, my brother was, he spend a year or so in another profession and was recalled to Being. He is a thirty year retiree now. Woke up at 8:30 and logged in at 9. Probably lsying atound in his underwear and periodically checking email all day while playing video games.

It has been updated after AMD announced it had entered into a multi-year deal to provide chips to OpenAI. Lisa Su is the engineer behind one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds in the tech industry. The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia. On Monday, the company announced that it had agreed to a massive multi-year deal to provide its AI chips to OpenAI. The announcement sent AMD's stock soaring as much as 27% in premarket trading. When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025. But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing. Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation: Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City. As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986. Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s. Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies. After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor. As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research. Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion. At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming. AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market. In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD. In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel. In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles. The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips. In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60. By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion. Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event. "I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility. In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building. Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology. Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together. Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends. Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title. Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother. Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers. AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia. When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because "the market is humongous" and she sees plenty of opportunities. On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware. In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential. But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out. "Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem." Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips. In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market. "We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. "They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation." In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses. On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead." The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations. On Monday, AMD announced it had agreed to a multi-billion-dollar partnership to supply its artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI. The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia. The multi-year deal, announced Monday, will see OpenAI deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first 1 gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026. It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets. "This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said. Jump to
