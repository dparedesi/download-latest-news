Title: Corporate America's new layoff strategy: smaller cuts, more often

Every time Tim publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The good news: You didn't get laid off. The bad? You might be cut next month. Some large employers are now embracing recurring job cuts rather than axing a bunch of workers all at once. That can help companies avoid cutting too deeply and minimize disruption. Yet drawn-out cuts can prolong workers' unease, pulverize morale, and make it harder for leaders to rally teams to move in a new direction. Companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have recently made cuts in stages. Amazon, which this week said it was laying off 14,000 employees, expects that in 2026 it will uncover "additional places we can remove layers," and "realize efficiency gains." Paramount, following its August merger with David Ellison's production company, Skydance, said this week it would cut about 1,000 employees. That's only about half of the expected reductions, a source familiar with the company's plans previously told Business Insider. Translation: More cuts are likely. Amazon declined to comment, and Paramount Skydance didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. "We're seeing a lot more of this drip-drip, which does cause uncertainty," Carly Holm, founder and CEO of the consulting firm Humani HR, told Business Insider. "It's not ideal." Layoffs have, in some cases, become a form of corporate preening — a way to demonstrate that those in charge are avoiding bloated org charts or feeble business lines, especially after turbo-charged hiring during the pandemic in industries like tech. Companies have also simply grown accustomed to routinely shedding workers, said Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "They may not have quite the same sense of, 'Gosh, this is bad, so let's just do it once and do it big,'" he told Business Insider. And with the job market cooling, Bidwell said, bosses don't have to worry as much that workers who remain will feel free to walk away. Many CEOs' thinking about layoffs has shifted over the decades, he said. Prior to around 1980, Bidwell said, employers tended to furlough workers, such as those in factories, when demand slipped, with the intention of hiring them back once things picked up. Layoffs, particularly among white-collar employees, were seen as a last resort, Bidwell said. "The big change today is, 'If we think it might raise profits, we're going to do it,'" he said. Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, said that researchers have found that layoffs can decrease creativity among workers who remain, and increase their stress and rates of burnout. That's why, he told Business Insider in an email, it would be "much better" to make one-time cuts rather than spreading them out. Another reason employers might prefer one big swing: People start leaving after layoffs. Research has shown that the share of workers who quit tends to increase by about 50% in the year following a layoff — and often the best performers are among them because they have options. While it can be disruptive to workers, it's easy to see why CEOs might not want to swing the axe all at once. If they overshoot, they risk having to hire again, and few things signal instability like a whiplash hiring spree. Getting the cuts over with might help morale and trust bounce back sooner, yet the approach also brings risks, said Sarah Rodehorst, cofounder and CEO of Onwards HR, which helps large companies stay compliant with regulations when laying off employees. In a moment when everything from AI to tariffs to government spending cuts is making decision-making difficult, there's a danger in cutting too quickly. What a business needs today could look very different six months from now, Rodehorst said. Plus, slashing too many people at once can make it harder to reassign work and rewire the organization's operations. "The business may need people for a period of time as part of that restructure," she said. "So, it's hard to let everyone go all at once." The risk, of course, is that the people left behind spend more time wondering if they're next rather than focusing on their jobs. Much as CEOs overseeing the cuts might wish it, the period after layoffs isn't exactly "innovation and growing-the-business time," said Scott Kirsner, CEO of InnoLead, a research firm focused on corporate innovation. Instead, he said, teams tend to be busy figuring out who's managing whom and what the company even looks like now. Bidwell, from Wharton, said that big cuts often create "huge turmoil" and that trying to avoid layoffs for several years can require leaders to make big predictions about what a business will need in the future. Even so, he said, the idea that businesses can simply cut and rehire as needed overlooks the hidden drags — things like damaged morale, lost institutional knowledge, and the time it takes new workers to get up to speed. "There are serious adjustment costs every time you bring new people in," Bidwell said. Besides, he said, while it's easy to tally up the salaries of laid-off workers, "it's a lot harder to assess the challenges that you're going to face in continuing to motivate your people and getting the work done."

Title: Amazon's Big Holiday Plan? Replacing 600,000 Human Workers With Robots, a New Report Says

Your guide to Amazon's automated future: What the 75% goal really means for workers. Learn more about Amazon's new goal to automate three-quarters of its warehouse tasks. Let's be real: Robots doing the grunt work at Amazon warehouses is nothing new; they've been sorting and moving packages for over a decade. But that was just the beginning. Amazon is now reportedly planning to make its human workforce a whole lot less necessary. According to The New York Times, the company is looking to replace replacing more than half a million jobs its human employees hold with a new, expanded robot army. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Internal Amazon documents suggest that the company is looking into building and using more robots to replace human workers. The publication doesn't specify if this will result in massive layoffs. However, the robots would allow Amazon to avoid hiring new workers to meet increasing demand, translating to 600,000 jobs replaced by 2033, according to the report. Amazon announced in June that it had hit a workforce milestone of deploying more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment and delivery network, making it about two-thirds the size of the company's human workforce. The Amazon documents show that the company's goal is to automate 75% of its operations, The Times reported. The shift to increase the role of robots in Amazon's warehouse could save the company billions of dollars each year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimated the annual savings to be as high as $4 billion by 2027, according to a CNBC report. The report also says the company wants to mitigate the fallout in communities that may lose jobs. Documents show the company has considered building an image as a "good corporate citizen" through greater participation in community events such as local parades and Toys for Tots. And the leaked documents discuss avoiding using terms like automation and AI, instead using terms such as "advanced technology," and replacing the word "robot" with "cobot" to suggest collaboration. "Leaked documents often paint an incomplete and misleading picture of our plans, and that's the case here," an Amazon spokesperson told CNET in an email. "In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines -- now or moving forward." The spokesperson said "no company has created more jobs in America over the past decade than Amazon" and that the company is actively hiring at operations facilities, with plans to fill 250,000 positions for the holiday season. Amazon is the third biggest employer in the US, behind the federal government and Walmart. To date, the company employs an estimated 1.5 million employees, most of whom work in warehouses or as delivery drivers. Only a handful of companies in the US have more than 600,000 employees on the payroll. Delivery company FedEx has an estimated 550,000 employees. Reducing its size as reported by The Times would be akin to FedEx disappearing entirely. Studies have been done on the impact of robots on human wages. As of 2020, every robot added by a company per 1,000 workers reduces US wages by 0.42% and has cost humans an estimated 400,000 jobs. "Our investments will continue to create substantial employment, emphasizing higher-paying positions," Amazon said in an email. "In particular, and as mentioned in The New York Times story, efficiency gains in one area enable us to invest in other areas -- both existing and entirely new ones -- that create additional value for customers. While it's difficult to predict the future precisely, our track record demonstrates that we've consistently been a major job creator while simultaneously investing in upskilling our workforce for evolving roles."

Title: System changes are being made in how organisations hire, train, and incentivise employees: Microsoft’s Jay Parikh on AI’s impact on tech industry
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/microsofts-jay-parikh-on-ais-impact-on-tech-industry-10337683/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T08:22:16Z

As generative AI tools become one of the most significant changes in software creation since the rise of the personal computer, their impact can be felt in how both large and small tech organisations operate. The latest tech executive to echo this trend is Microsoft’s Jay Parikh, who has once again indicated that the artificial intelligence boom is not only changing the size and shape of the workforce at organisations but also how products are being developed. “There are some system changes here in terms of companies going through organisational change whether it be how they have organised things, how they incentivise, hire, and train employees, how they think about product development, or how they may think about should they be growing, staying flat, or shrink,” Parikh said in a closed-door briefing with select journalists at the GitHub Universe event in San Francisco this week. Parikh avoided using the term “layoffs”, but said companies are still “learning” and “figuring things out” as artificial intelligence, which Silicon Valley sees as the next major technological revolution, is dramatically changing organisations. Parikh, a former top engineering executive at Meta, was hired by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last year. Earlier this year, he was announced as Microsoft’s Executive Vice-President of CoreAI, a new engineering team responsible for AI initiatives across the company. He also oversees GitHub, which now operates as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI group. At major organisations worldwide, especially in the tech sector, several companies are reducing their workforces due to the adoption of AI. These job cuts are affecting white-collar workers in HR, marketing, sales, and engineering divisions — roles that were once considered high-paying. A recent Stanford study suggests that the impact of AI may hit harder on younger workers, especially in coding and customer support roles. This week, Amazon announced it had begun a reorganisation that will result in the elimination of 14,000 roles worldwide, citing AI as a key factor. Amazon joins other major companies in attributing recent job cuts to the use of AI. Walmart has also recently indicated that it intends to maintain its headcount at current levels over the next several years, primarily due to the impact of AI. Salesforce recently reduced its workforce by 4,000, citing “the benefits and efficiencies” brought by AI. One might question whether AI is bringing significant benefits, leading to layoffs becoming necessary. That remains unclear, but more large companies are now using, investing in, and measuring the business impact of generative AI, which suggests that the size and structure of their workforces are about to change, if they haven’t already. Ever since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT a few years ago, the AI chatbot has introduced consumers to a new way of interacting with technology by simply providing a prompt and receiving information about almost anything. It has since made its way into enterprises, with companies deploying customised AI agents to automate functions in customer support, marketing, coding, and across many domains. It’s not hard to see why Microsoft is turning to GitHub, which now boasts 180 million developers, to increase the adoption of AI agents across enterprises. In fact, Microsoft wants GitHub to become the central platform for AI coding agents. Its new Agent HQ interface allows external coding assistants, including OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code, to plug into the GitHub ecosystem. Microsoft and the entire tech industry are promoting AI agents as the most critical AI tools for businesses. These agents can automate complex routines, solve multistep problems, and handle large volumes of work in structured tasks such as computer programming, and document processing. As more organisations deploy armies of AI agents at scale, these agents work on their behalf, much like interns. However, the concern is that as demand for AI agents grows, these systems can now make sales calls and write software code — tasks once reserved for humans. The question is, if AI systems start writing code and building software, who will fill those roles when entry-level engineers are cut off and no longer get the opportunity? “I believe that the notion and definition of developers is going to change radically. I think we are going to see a lot more people able to build within any team, whether it’s a team of four or a team of 40,000; it doesn’t matter. I think the focus will be on how we use these superpowers – the capabilities of these agents and tools, and how quickly we can create things to reduce toil. This will allow us to spend more time on the creative and ideation side, and to be able to burn down backlogs much quicker,” Parikh said, responding to how the role of developers will evolve.

Amazon Games has confirmed it will stop active development on its MMO New World, following the recent company-wide layoffs. The studio said Season 10: Nighthaven will serve as the final content drop, and that servers will remain online through 2026 while the team focuses on stabilization and basic support, stating in the official statement that “It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision.” The move follows a major restructuring across Amazon that has hit its games division hard. Reporting and company notices show substantial cuts affecting multiple Amazon Games teams, and the broader corporate shift appears to prioritize smaller, cloud-focused, and AI-driven projects over costly first-party MMO roadmaps. For players, the news stops short of an immediate closure: PvE, PvP, and in-game services will continue to operate, and the storefront will remain available, with Amazon providing a minimum notice period should a shutdown be considered beyond 2026. For the community, the announcement confirms what many dataminers and active players feared after earlier layoffs. New World enjoyed a resurgence earlier this year after substantial reworks and a cross-platform push, but sustaining the schedule and scope of MMO content is expensive. With active player numbers well below the title’s earlier peaks, Amazon judged further investment in fresh seasons and expansions to be unsustainable. Amazon’s approach is to treat the upcoming seasonal update as the last significant chapter, while shifting remaining staff to maintenance, bug fixes, and player support. The studio explicitly noted it will keep servers running for an extended wind-down period, allowing guilds and long-term players time to finish objectives and archive progress. The company also made recent content, such as Rise of the Angry Earth, free to players as part of the transition. Streamers and community organizers have already begun planning legacy runs and archival events, and questions about refunds, in-game economies, and long-term item availability are trending topics in community threads. The New World outcome highlights how corporate layoffs ripple into player communities and long-term product plans, and it underscores the high cost of sustaining large-scale online worlds. Players should expect official patch and compensation details to appear on New World’s channels in the coming weeks. For now, Season 10 is the swan song for active development, and players have through 2026 to finish their goals or prepare for whatever comes next in Amazon’s games strategy.

Title: Corporate America says AI isn't about cost-cutting, but jobs will go anyway, a Goldman Sachs banker survey finds

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Corporate America has touted artificial intelligence as the start of a new era of productivity, but Goldman Sachs' latest report suggests job cuts are already on the horizon. Goldman's analysis is based on a survey of 105 Goldman bankers, who service clients across various industries. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at how major US companies are actually utilizing AI and what that means for their workforces. The survey found that companies are primarily turning to AI to boost productivity and revenue — not to slash costs — with nearly half of banking clients using the technology to drive growth. This compares with just one in five deploying it primarily to cut expenses. Meanwhile, only about one in 10 firms has reduced head count so far due to AI, though nearly a third of bankers covering technology, media, and telecom clients report early signs of job pressure. Still, the bankers expect AI to start trimming payrolls soon. They forecast a 4% reduction in head count over the next year, followed by a deeper 11% cut within three years. "The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and head count reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected," wrote Goldman's analysts, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, in a Thursday note. About 55% of Goldman's bankers expect clients to rely on hiring freezes or natural attrition as AI reshapes roles, while 26% anticipate layoffs or broader restructuring. Goldman's bankers also see the most significant potential for AI-driven reductions in head count in customer support, where 80% of respondents expect cuts as automation takes hold. Other positions at risk include those in administrative support, operations at 49%, and IT and engineering. Goldman's report lands amid a wave of recent layoffs that underscore how quickly workforce reductions are spreading beyond traditional cost-cutting drives. Earlier this week, tech giant Amazon cut 14,000 jobs with CEO Andy Jassy saying the cuts were driven by cultural fit — not cost savings or AI. Still, the timing highlights how technology is reshaping hiring across sectors. "The relatively high current and expected adoption rates for US corporates and meaningful expected head count reductions support our long-standing view that AI is set to have a transformative impact on the labor market and economy," they wrote. Goldman's forecast for job losses reflects the rapid adoption of AI by companies. Goldman's bankers report that 37% of clients are already using AI for regular production — significantly above the Census Bureau's recent survey, which showed a 9.9% adoption rate. They expect the share of overall adoption to rise to 50% next year and 74% within three years, suggesting a rapid acceleration as AI tools become more embedded in day-to-day operations. Yet many companies remain cautious. About 61% of Goldman's bankers said clients view AI as "too early a technology" to deploy widely, and 47% said firms lack the in-house expertise to build the right tools. Jump to

Title: Not AI Or Costs, Amazon CEO Cited This Reason Behind Mass Layoffs

Amazon’s decision to slash 14,000 jobs this week was not about cutting costs or chasing artificial intelligence (AI) trends. Instead, it was a move to realign the company’s culture, according to CEO Andy Jassy. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Oct. 30, Jassy commented on the layoffs for the first time. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said, according to a Business Insider report. “It really— it's culture.” Jassy’s remarks reportedly reflect his ongoing effort to reshape Amazon’s internal culture this year, a push focused on raising performance standards, enforcing discipline and cutting through bureaucracy. The job cuts announced on Oct. 28 represent Amazon’s largest round of layoffs since the company shed 27,000 roles in late 2022. During Thursday’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon’s rapid expansion in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers” within the organisation, which in turn slowed down decision-making. He said that with the ongoing AI transformation reshaping industries, agility is more important than ever. “Sometimes, without realising it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy said, according to Business Insider, adding, “And it can lead to slowing you down.” Jassy’s comments highlight a trend spreading across Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft have also been flattening their organisational structures, reducing management layers to accelerate operations and eliminate corporate excess. In the latest round of job cuts on Oct. 28, Amazon reportedly informed some affected employees of their termination through text messages. Many workers received two early-morning texts that day, notifying them their roles had been eliminated. The first message advised staff to check their personal or work email accounts before leaving for the office, while a follow-up text instructed anyone who had not yet received an email about their employment status to contact the helpdesk for assistance. The purpose of these text alerts, sent shortly after the emails, was reportedly to prevent affected employees from facing the awkward situation of arriving at work only to find their building access had been revoked.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defends 14,000 job cuts, says ‘not about costs or AI’ — so what's behind it?

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after CEO Andy Jassy had warned that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could reduce the company’s workforce. In a surprising twist during Amazon's quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not about cost-cutting or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said the affected employees did not align with Amazon's culture. This marked the first time he addressed the layoffs since their announcement. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” Andy Jassy's remarks align with Amazon's broader mission to reshape its culture this year, as chronicled by Business Insider. He has been working to raise the e-commerce giant's performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy across the company. During the earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon's rapid growth in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers,” which has ultimately slowed down the decision-making process. He stressed the need for the company to “operate leaner and move faster,” especially amid the transformative impact of AI across different industries. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.” While Jassy focused on cultural and structural factors behind the layoffs, the initial announcement — made by Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, through a blog post on Tuesday — cited a different reason. Galetti explained that the rapid evolution of the world due to AI was the reason behind reducing employee headcount, despite the company's strong performance. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” Galetti wrote in the blog post. The most recent layoffs at Amazon marked the company's biggest job cut since it let go of 27,000 employees in late 2022, Business Insider reported. The move also points to a wider trend in Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft are embracing what's being called the “Great Flattening” - trimming layers of managers to move faster and reduce corporate bloat. Amazon also disclosed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs, the news report said.

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: AI didn’t break agencies – the talent drain did

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A senior marketer at a major WPP Media client told me recently they’re thinking about shopping around for a new agency. That, in itself, isn’t surprising, especially after WPP’s new CEO Cindy Rose, publicly admitted the company had “lost its way”. What stood out was why they’re considering the move. It’s not about chasing AI breakthroughs or assembling yet another full-stack planning and buying setup. It’s something more fundamental — and harder to fix: the people. “They’re ultimately what matter to me as a client,” they continued. “If we put the account up for a review, that’s going to be part of our decision. We’re not big enough to get the best payment terms so we have to focus on where we get the best service.” Because while AI and data dominate the holding company narrative, the harder truth is it’s still about the people, specifically the ones talking to clients, translating their needs and hopes into something a machine can use. Without them, there’s no story worth telling and no work worth executing. That’s true for small clients as much as it is for the biggest ones. And it’s the quiet advantage of the best holdcos. Not the grand vision but the execution. It’s why WPP fought so hard to keep Laurent Ezekiel from leaving for Publicis – and taking Coca-Cola’s North American media business with him. It’s also why Jacki Kelley, IPG’s chief client and business officer, has become such a stabilizing force as she guides clients through the uncertainty surrounding Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of the group. “The client owners at the holdcos are very powerful at the moment,” said Rube Schreurs, CEO of media management firm Ebiquity. “They run these big pitches, and they are the ones who coordinate and bring together all these different capabilities across the agency group to benefit the client.” The real power inside holdcos now belongs to the people who run the clients, not the ones running the agencies. Think of them as chief client or business officers. Their work isn’t flashy but its crucial. Take something as basic as managing a client roster. Stack too many high-maintenance accounts that demand constant re-planning, and even the strongest teams start to crack. Balance one or two of those with steadier clients, and things stay sustainable. It’s agency management 101 but it’s harder to pull off when the pressure to chase growth collides with the reality of leaner headcounts. Ultimately, that’s what CMOs buy. Not tools or tech stacks but people who can make the complicated feel simple and the promises real. I was reminded of that in a recent conversation with a consultant who advises two WPP clients. I asked whether either of them was concerned by the holdco’s struggles, and they laughed before saying no. For them, what matters most isn’t the corporate shakeups. It’s the service they get from their account director – the person who knows their business, answers the phone and makes things happen. That person, the consultant said, is far more valuable to them than any data platform or AI capability. Not least because the technology can flatter to deceive. Agencies have laid off hundreds of people in the name of AI, yet the promise of truly autonomous agents still hasn’t materialized. Most of what’s being sold as automation still needs human oversight. And even then, it hasn’t shown it can come close to the kind of ingenuity that made advertising a cultural force in the first place. None of this dismisses the importance of technology. It just means the human layer – the senior talent that keeps clients connected to a complicated, centralized structure – has never mattered more. These are the people who know how to make a holding company work for a client, not against them. When that experience walks out the door, things start to fray: briefs go missing, timelines slip and what was meant to feel seamless turns into red tape. The irony, of course, is that these executives are now in short supply just as their value is becoming obvious. Some have left on their own terms, others were pushed out. Many were the ones who didn’t fit in a model that prized consolidation over chemistry and scale over service. Now, as holdcos try to rewire themselves for the AI era, they’re learning the same old lesson: the people were the strategy all along. The machines are improving but the judgment around them is eroding. That’s what stood out in the World Federation of Advertisers’ latest report: more marketers are reaching a level of maturity where they value agency execs who can move across a holdco’s resources, unshackled by P&L silos or internal questions. When they ask a question, they don’t want spin or salesmanship, they want a clear, honest answer. “These people are unicorns,” said one executive. “They can read the numbers, understand the brief and challenge the model. But they’re the first ones deemed too expensive.” Which is to say: for all the talk about AI transforming agencies, it’s also hollowing them out, leaving fewer people capable of critical judgement inside increasingly automated structures. Agencies save money on executional labor but rarely reinvest it in the translators — the people who can make the technology useful. Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer of MediaSense, summed it up in a message he sent me: “AI is of course transforming the future of work for Agencies but agentic without agency (small a!) is a potential recipe for disaster. There are essentially two transformations underway within agencies. First delivering the promise of AI through more effective, more strategic and thoughtful work (at scale). Second, doing this ‘through the line’ and breaking down the silos that are holding clients back from truly customer centric marketing. This was an important theme in our Future of Media Organisation study which revealed how intentionally brands and their media organizations are pivoting from being individual contributors to connectors of the customer journey. For agencies this demands a reset in their talent profile and the curriculum needed to be valuable to today’s marketer.” The ad industry’s plan to define what counts as AI With AI on the rise, industry bodies such as the IAB, MRC and WFA are all taking their own approaches in an attempt to bring some order to the chaos. At the same time, some marketers are already starting to steer their clients away from AI-made “slop” In graphic detail: how AI search is changing brand visibility Digiday has charted the state of AI search for marketers and how brands are (and aren’t) responding. Ad tech’s economy depends on float and it’s getting pricier to keep it moving Typically in ad tech, money moves slower than the ads it sells. But it turns out as time goes on, those late payments are being delayed more and more, and agencies of all sizes aren’t immune to the impacts it has. Meta shares fall on higher expense guidance despite record revenue Meta recorded $51.2 billion in revenue during its Q3 2025 earnings call, equating to a 26% year-over-year growth, but after warning analysts and investors that the amount the company spends on AI is likely to rise “significantly”, Meta’s stock dropped more than 7%, according to WSJ. OpenAI has an AGI problem – and Microsoft just made it worse OpenAI has a new for-profit structure, but its latest deal with Microsoft seems to come with some strings attached, according to The Verge. Nvidia becomes world’s first $5tn company Nvidia has become the world’s first $5 trillion company, according to Financial Times. The company’s stock increased as a result of strong sales of its AI systems, as well as the prospect of access to China, an idea that is expected to be floated by President Donald Trump during his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. More than 1,500 chief executives have left their posts so far this year through August, up 4% from last year. It’s no secret the company wants advertisers to see its demand-side platform as the backbone for buying across the open web. The holdco hopes its new product can open up SaaS revenue.

Title: Sega Forever creator confirms departure from Sega after seven years

Former Senior Global Community Manager for Sega of America, Danny Russell, who spearheaded the Sega Forever initiative, confirmed that he’s left the company after more than seven years via a LinkedIn post. In the post, he announced, “After some time away from socials for personal reasons, I’m ready to share that last year I moved on from Sega, closing an incredible chapter of my career.” Russell mentioned his proudest achievements in the post, including launching and running Sega Forever from scratch. The initiative was launched in 2017 by Sega as a move to re-release retro classics on iOS and Android. The Sega Forever project evolved beyond a retro-emulation service and gradually shifted into a game preservation effort, featuring retrospectives and unearthing and preserving rare assets in a digital archive. Sega Forever’s social media handle on X became the voice for retro enthusiasts worldwide, posting almost daily until it finally went silent by the end of August 2023, with the final post celebrating the recovery and restoration of the SEGAWORLD London Sonic statue at Gamescom. Many speculate that the abrupt silence was due to layoffs at Sega. In September 2023, Russell deleted a post that suggested some internal struggles. In the post, Russell stated: What should you do when you’ve been bullied all year and no one is helping, five months after raising a grievance. I have been off ill in recent weeks, adapting to medication due to the stress of this past year, and this bully has used this time to take even more away from me. Sega briefly teased a revival of the Sega Forever project back in January 2025 with a rebranded X account, but it has not led to anything new since. By June 2025, Sega delisted many of its classic titles from Android and iOS storefronts. However, players who downloaded the now-removed titles can still play them offline. Russell concluded the post, stating: I am deeply grateful to fans, collaborators, content creators, and partners I worked with along the way. Your creativity and passion made every project special. I am especially excited to have seen Shinobi return and remain hopeful that other legacy IPs that I supported behind the scenes (Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Virtua Fighter) get the spotlight they deserve. I wish my friends at Sega all the best for the future. Buy Sega Genesis Classics on Amazon Danny Russell – LinkedIn, Mirror post on X

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Earnings week for the Mag 7 brought mixed results and sharp stock moves. Apple rose more than 3 percent after reporting $102.47 billion revenue and $1.85 EPS, driven by iPhone and Services. Alphabet logged its first $100 billion quarter, up 16 percent year over year, on strong search and cloud performance. Microsoft posted $77.7 billion revenue and $3.72 EPS but fell on concerns about AI infrastructure spending. Meta set a record $51.24 billion revenue, then dropped 10 percent after a $15.9 billion tax charge and rising Reality Labs capex. Oracle stayed elevated as cloud sales climbed 28 percent in September. Amazon jumped over 13% after the market closed thanks to the AWS cloud unit posting its largest revenue growth rate since 2022. Nvidia reached a $5 trillion valuation on relentless AI chip demand, announced seven U.S. supercomputers, invested $1 billion in Nokia, and confirmed plans for up to $100 billion in OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang forecast $500 billion in AI chip sales as investors treated Nvidia as the core of global AI infrastructure. Shares rose 5.6% to $212.19 after reports that President Trump will discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chips with China’s Xi Jinping. CEO Jensen Huang projected $500 billion in AI chip sales and announced seven new U.S. supercomputers. Nvidia also invested $1 billion in Nokia to develop AI-native 5G and 6G networks. Its stock is up 50% this year. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, cementing its dominance as AI infrastructure demand outpaces supply. Sesame, the smart-glasses startup led by former Oculus co-founders Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell, raised $250 million in Series B funding. Sequoia Capital and Spark Capital led the round bringing total funding to about $300 million. The company is developing lightweight AI-powered glasses equipped with voice assistants named Miles and Maya to create an “ambient interface” that understands context and environment. Sesame’s blend of spatial computing and conversational AI positions it as a competitor to Apple, Meta, and Google-backed Magic Leap in the race to define the next generation of AI wearables. For Iribe, who previously founded Scaleform (acquired by Autodesk) and co-founded Oculus (acquired by Facebook for $2 billion), Sesame marks his fourth major venture. White-collar layoffs are accelerating as AI adoption reshapes office work. Last week we reported Amazon is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. This is the tip of the AI iceberg looming before the labor market. UPS has trimmed 14,000 managers over two years, and Target plans 1,800 more cuts. JPMorgan, Walmart, Accenture and others have revealed plans to slow hiring. All cited AI. PwC, the accounting and consulting giant, cut staff globally, partly because of AI. Nestlé cut jobs, blaming automation.GM to Booz Allen are reducing staff, citing efficiency and automation. Nearly two million Americans have been unemployed for six months or longer, while demand for trade, healthcare, and construction workers rises. Recruiters report middle-aged professionals struggling to keep up with new technologies and entry-level hiring tightening. Economists warn that AI-driven restructuring is eroding white-collar stability even as overall productivity improves.The irony is that the companies downsizing will yield huge dividends from Wall Street, which as far as I can tell, has never met a reorg it does not like (remember Meta’s “year of efficiency”?) OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced plans to create an autonomous “AI researcher” by 2028, with an intern-level assistant expected by 2026. The company is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing large-scale investment while its nonprofit foundation retains 26% ownership. Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki said models could surpass human intelligence within a decade through greater “test time compute” and algorithmic advances. OpenAI plans to dedicate entire data centers to major research problems, investing $1.4 trillion to build 30 gigawatts of infrastructure. The foundation will allocate $25 billion for disease research and oversee safety and governance. Magic Leap and Google have partnered to build reference hardware for the Android XR ecosystem. At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, they revealed a prototype that merges Magic Leap’s waveguide optics with Google’s Raxium microLED engine, a key technology for lightweight AR glasses. The three-year deal positions Magic Leap as an optics and display supplier rather than a consumer brand, with Google focusing on the software layer. The prototype underscores Google’s return to spatial computing and its strategy to seed Android-based AR hardware through partners instead of producing its own glasses. VRChat has launched on Android and iOS, opening the social VR platform to millions of mobile users. The iOS app supports devices running iOS 17 or newer, while Android requires version 10 and at least 6 GB RAM. Phones with less memory can use a limited “Companion” mode. The mobile rollout ends the platform’s beta phase and extends its reach beyond PC and VR headsets, potentially driving major user growth. VRChat recently hit 54,000 concurrent users on PC, its highest count in years, and expects a significant surge as mobile players join its creator-driven virtual worlds. Meta Horizon is approaching mobile XR the same way. Rec Room tried this, but all it did was add users and UGC spam, not revenue, and was partially responsible for layoffs there. This column has a companion, The AI/XR Podcast, hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, and Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and futurist for Paramount and Fox, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

Title: Amazon CEO Now Says AI Is Not Responsible for Recent Layoffs
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-ceo-now-says-ai-is-not-responsible-for-recent-layoffs-2000679893
Time Published: 2025-10-31T00:15:14Z

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes Amazon just posted its third-quarter earnings and it turns out it was a phenomenal quarter for the e-commerce giant, despite recent layoffs. The company giant raked in $180.2 billion in sales in the three months ending Sept. 30, up 13% from the same period last year. Its cloud business, AWS, reported its largest year-over-year growth since 2022, climbing 20% to $33 billion. The company’s stock even popped 13% in after-hours trading following the report. So why, with the company performing so well, did Amazon just slash 14,000 corporate jobs and hinted that more cuts could be on the way? Fortunately for us, CEO Andy Jassy was asked to comment on the layoffs during the company’s earnings call Thursday evening. However, he was quick to downplay any connection to AI. âWhat I would tell you is, you know, the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now at least,â Jassy told investors. âIt’s culture.â He went on to try to make the case that the companyâs rapid growth over the last several years added more people, layers, and complexity to its operations. This quick growth, in turn, slowed decision-making and weakened ownership for workers at the frontlines. Jassy said Amazon is now committed to operating like the world’s largest startup in order to move more quickly during what he called the major “technology transformation happening right now.â The memo sent to laid-off employees earlier this week hit a lot of the same points Jassy made. But it also directly named the big tech shift, AI, that he had been hinting at, even as he claimed it wasnât driving this round of layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,â wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, in the memo. Still, these job cuts also come as Amazon, and the rest of Silicon Valley, is seemingly betting it all on AI. Jassy said on Thursday that the companyâs AI and cloud infrastructure added more than 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months and is expected to add another gigawatt this fourth quarter. And future cuts may not be limited to corporate workers. The New York Times reported last week that Amazonâs automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. Overall, Amazonâs robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the companyâs operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.

Title: Amazon's CEO says its 14,000 job cuts weren't driven by costs or AI: 'It's about culture'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs this week — not to cut costs or chase AI, but because they didn't fit the culture. That's according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who shared his thoughts about the layoffs for the first time during the company's quarterly earnings call on Thursday. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said, referring to the job cuts announced on Tuesday. "It really — it's culture." Jassy's remark aligns with his broader mission to reshape Amazon's culture this year, which Business Insider chronicled. He is trying to raise performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts on Tuesday in a blog post, explaining that despite the company's strong performance, it is reducing jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote. Tuesday's layoffs marked Amazon's biggest job cut since it shed 27,000 positions in late 2022. On Thursday's call, Jassy said Amazon's rapid growth in recent years created "a lot more layers" that have slowed decision-making. He emphasized that, with the ongoing AI transformation, there has never been a more critical time for the company to operate leaner and move faster. "Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work," Jassy added. "And it can lead to slowing you down." Amazon isn't the only Big Tech giant embracing the "Great Flattening." Google and Microsoft have been trimming layers of managers too, aiming to move faster and shed corporate bloat. Amazon also revealed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs. Have a tip?

Title: Amazon CEO Says 14,000-Person Layoffs Weren’t Due to AI or Finances: ‘It’s About Culture’

“It’s important to be lean,” Andy Jassy says as he touts the tech behemoth as “the world’s largest startup” Amazon’s 14,000-person layoffs earlier this week weren’t necessarily driven by financial or AI factors, CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. Instead, the primary motivation behind cutting the workforce was “culture,” he explained. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now. It’s culture,” he told analysts on the call, explaining that as Amazon grew dramatically over the last few years, the company added more “layers” that became cumbersome to its decision-making process. “When that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down,” he said. Jassy continued: “As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and that means removing layers, it means increasing the amount of ownership that people have and it means inventing and moving quickly. I don’t know if there’s ever been a time in the history of Amazon, or maybe business in general, with the technology transformation happening right now where it’s important to be lean, important to be flat, it’s important to move fast, and that’s what we’re going to do.” When Amazon cut 14,000 people on Tuesday, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, cited the need to be nimble in the AI era in a note to staff. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” The layoffs may not be over yet, although Jassy did not indicate more to come on Thursday’s earnings call. The company has plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots in the coming years, believing it can leverage new technology to avoid filling hundreds of thousands of roles, according to the New York Times.

Title: Amazon Stock Pops As Q3 Tops Forecasts: AWS Strong, $1.8 Billion In Severance Costs, Shout Out To ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Amazon shares jumped 10% on Thursday as the company’s third quarter numbers beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines by a lot and by even more for the closely watched Amazon Web Services, or AWS, division. Revenue rose 13% to $180 billion for the September quarter and jumped 20% at AWS. Total net income per share of $1.95 was a big beat including gains from investments in Anthropic. Operating income was flat at $17.4 billion including a $2.5 billion FTC settlement and a $1.8 billion in estimated severance charges related to planned job eliminations. Those came this week when it announced a hefty 14,000 layoffs across divisions with video games among the hardest hit and departures of creative executives across Amazon MGM Studios. Just 10 days ago, Amazon Web Services was the target of national and international ire as a major outage took down its own suite of apps and websites from Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa, to other major sites from Signal, WhatsApp and Snapchat to IMDb, Disney+, Fortnite, Roblox and Wordle among many others. Watch on Deadline So the company badly needed some good at AWS, which is its window to AI. Investors were also pleased with the company’s guidance. “We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,” said CEO Andy Jassy. “AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY. We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.” He said the e-commerce giant is on track “to deliver to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever again this year, expand same-day delivery of perishable groceries to over 2,300 communities by end of year, and double the number of rural communities with access to Amazon’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery.” The company ticked off an army of bullet points as it does each quarter, now mostly around AI but with a few entertainment shout-outs. They were: 70 million+ viewers globally for The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 (through seven days post-finale), global viewership growth for second consecutive season (exceeding Season 2 by 65%), and the announced feature film; kicking off fourth season of Thursday Night Football on Prime Video, averaging 15.3 million viewers (the best for TNF on any network in a decade) according to Nielsen, which is a 16% increase over last season’s seven-game average; debuting NBA on Prime in more than 200 countries, delivering average audience of 1.25 million viewers in the U.S. during a season-opening doubleheader, according to Nielsen; adding Peacock Premium Plus and Fox One to Prime Video add-on subscription offerings of 100+ channels in the U.S.; and launched the reimagined Luna cloud gaming service, including GameNight, a new collection of living room games, at no additional cost to Prime members.

Amazon (AMZN) shares popped in extended trading Thursday after the e-commerce and cloud giant posted third-quarter results that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growth in its cloud business. The shares were up over 13% above $253 after hours, at what would be their first all-time high since early February. The online retail and cloud computing provider reported earnings per share of $1.95, up from $1.43 the same time a year ago, and well above the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $180.2 billion, also beating expectations as sales in the company's Amazon Web Services segment jumped 20% to $33 billion. Like many of its big tech peers, Amazon faces pressure to show its investments in AI are paying off, and Thursday's strong showing from its cloud business and the ensuing jump in Amazon's stock would point to growing optimism about its trajectory. "We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business," said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, adding that the company has particularly benefited from "strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity." Looking ahead, Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to come in between $206 billion and $213 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $208.66 billion. The company also lifted its projected capital expenditures for the full year to $125 billion from about $118 billion previously, with CFO Brian Olsavsky telling investors during Thursday's earnings call he expects it to rise in 2026. Earlier this week, Amazon announced what could be its largest layoffs in the company's history, with plans to reduce its headcount by about 14,000 jobs, through layoffs and changes to hiring plans as it and other tech companies look to trim costs elsewhere as they boost investments in AI infrastructure. Through Thursday's close, the shares were up less than 2% for 2025, as concerns about tariffs and disappointing cloud growth earlier in the year weighed on sentiment around the stock. This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share prices.

Reading time: Reading time 4 minutes It’s not a particularly good time to be a (human) worker in America. Tens of thousands of people have been laid off over the past several days, and the general outlook for job-seekers appears grim, to say the least. This week, Amazon announced plans to neutralize some 14,000 positions, while Meta said it would purge several hundred people from various offices throughout California and Washington state. Chegg, the online learning platform, announced plans to reduce its workforce by a whopping 45 percent on Monday. Several other large American companiesâincluding FedEx, Paramount, General Motors, Target, and UPSâsimilarly announced plans to eliminate jobs. The consensus seems to be that this sudden employment blood bath may just be the birthing pangs of the new AI ageâa time in which jobs are no longer an indicator of economic success, I guess. Headlines about the layoffs have routinely included AI as a factor, a trend encouraged by the companies themselves. Indeed, in Amazon’s announcement about its new downsizing, the company’s executive, Beth Galetti, cited AI, noting that the company needs to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Similarly, in its layoffs announcement, Chegg cited the “new realities of AI” as a factor. But is it really AI’s fault, or is it just the case that the American economy is currently riding a one-way ticket to the trash heap? Is an AI-ified economy one with fewer jobs? Or does a bad economy just mean more AI? Or are the companies suffering from other ailments and simply leaning into the AI narrative for cover? NBC News recently interviewed an economic scholar who seemed skeptical of the narrative surrounding job loss and AI. âItâs much easier for a company to say, âWe are laying workers off because weâre realizing AI-related efficienciesâ than to say âWeâre laying people off because weâre not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,ââ David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. âWhether or not AI were the reason, youâd be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI,â he added. BBC, meanwhile, recently interviewed Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University, who felt that the AI talk was overblown. “A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,” Gimbel told the outlet. “But so far, nothing that I’ve seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle.” In other words, companies may be simply saving face by pretending that losing team members and downsizing is really just part of a glorious pivot towards “leaner,” “more efficient” automation. In reality, these companies may be hurting and may be taking advantage of the current narrative around AI to spin that hurt into PR gold. If you’re a large company, you’d be forgiven for not feeling your best these days. Indeed, the indicators for the U.S. economy right now are, in a word, bad. Conveniently for Trump, the U.S. government continues to be shut down, which means that the organizations that would traditionally monitor and report on the nation’s economic health (like the Fed) are unable to do their jobs. However, even without official government analysis, financial experts are expressing skepticism about the health of the economy. For instance, Morningstar, a financial services firm that specializes in economic analysis, recently noted that U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was lower than in previous years, and that this growth slump is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with consumers becoming more and more cautious about spending. Additionally, consumer sentiment and the strength of the labor market have both been weakening, the report says, citing the most recent job growth data provided by the government: There are multiple ways to look at the health of the US labor market, which is tied to the overall health of the economy. Job growth is a primary indicator…The US economyÂ added just 22,000 jobs in AugustÂ as unemployment continued to rise. That number is well below what economists had previously expected and the 79,000 reported in July. The revised June numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the US economy lost 13,000 jobs in June. The report also notes that inflation has continued to stick around, and the price of goods has shot up “in response to tariffs, as producers started passing along higher import prices.” In short, due to the Trump administration’s bizarre policies, there is a lot of economic uncertainty right now, and uncertainty, as we all know, isn’t great for markets. As an example, next month, the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Trump’s tariffsâwhich have been challenged by lawsuitsâare legal or not. If they prove to be illegal, the Trump administration may have to facilitate the repayment of all of the revenue generated by those tariffs, which would be logistically insane and a hugely disruptive process for the federal government. As we all know, uncertainty is, itself, not great for an economy, since, to confidently maneuver and make money, businesses need to know that they can put one foot in front of the other without falling down a manhole. So are layoffs happening because more companies are adopting AI or because the economy is doing poorly? Or for some other reason? From the outside, it’s impossible to tell, but suffice it to say, there is definitely more than one possible explanation for why companies are currently shedding jobs like nobody’s business.

Title: Goldman Sachs survey says only 11% of companies are actively linking layoffs to AI—but the real shock is yet to come

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. While the latest wave of AI-linked layoffs has put job seekers—and even the Federal Reserve—on high alert, a new survey from Goldman Sachs suggests the real AI labor meltdown is still to come. The report, which surveyed more than 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers, found that only 11% of their clients across industries such as tech, industrials, and finance were actively cutting employees as a result of AI. Instead, 47% of the bankers reported their clients were disproportionately using AI to boost productivity and revenue, while only a fifth were mostly using the tech to cut costs. “AI use has so far been more skewed toward raising productivity/revenue than reducing costs,” wrote analysts led by Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of global investment research Jan Hatzius. The catch: A much higher percentage (31%) of tech, media, and communications companies were cutting jobs because of AI. This caveat is reflected in the spate of mass layoffs that large tech companies have conducted over the past couple of months. Amazon earlier this week was the latest—laying off 14,000 middle managers as the company prepares for a new world of advanced AI with a “leaner” workforce. Other companies such as Salesforce and tech-focused consultancy Accenture have together added tens of thousands of workers to the pile of AI-related layoffs in the past few months. The headlines have been so bleak that Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve is watching carefully. While companies may not be laying off workers now, bankers believe more layoffs could occur in the next few years. Over the next year, the bankers predict their clients will push forward a 4% general decrease in headcount, while over the next three years, those headcount reductions could skyrocket to 11%. The worst-affected category for future layoffs is financial institutions, which bankers predict could see a 14% reduction in general headcount over the next three years. Tech, which has been among the quickest to adopt AI, could see slightly lower cuts of 10%. “The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and headcount reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the U.S. labor market could arrive sooner than expected,” wrote the Goldman analysts. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Palantir CTO Thinks AI-Driven Mass Unemployment Is a ‘Fundraising Shtick’

Reading time: Reading time 4 minutes The chief technology officer of one of the most consequential mass-surveillance companies in the world, Palantir, thinks that artificial general intelligence is a fantasy and that the narrative that AI will replace jobs is a marketing tactic. “I think the secularists in Silicon Valley are filling the God-shaped hole in their heart with A.G.I,” Sankar told the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday. “The doomerism of Silicon Valley is both a fund-raising shtick, where the Frontier Labs can say: My technology is so powerful, it’s going to lead to mass unemployment, so you better invest in me, or you’re going to be poorâand also itâs divorced from any sort of reality,” Sankar said. He isn’t the only one who has raised skepticism over the future of AI and its relationship to labor. AGI, sometimes referred to as superintelligence, is a yet-to-be-developed AI system that could theoretically outperform human intelligence on virtually all scales. It has become the holy grailÂ for AI-first Silicon Valley companies likeÂ Meta, which has undertakenÂ a multibillion-dollar spending spree to be the first to reach it. Many experts warnÂ of theÂ perils of AGI if it is achieved, while others are skeptical that the technology can ever reachÂ that level of sophistication. But AI need not evolve into superintelligence before it can start fundamentally shifting the way our society operates. The most recent and major hit has been to labor. CEOs across industries have been open about their plans to have AI replace current or potential future workers as a profit-maximization effort. Amazon just recently laid off 14,000 corporate workers, citing the “transformative” potential of AI. Meanwhile, a recent Stanford study found that AI might have already started disproportionately crushing the young graduate job market. Still, despite all these findings, many remain suspicious. New York University professor of management and organizations Robert Seamans told Gizmodo in August that AI adoption across the corporate sector remains relatively low. Instead of AI being the culprit behind the layoffs, Seamans thinks it’s a scapegoat for the performance of the firm, because it’s much harder to blame tariffs or economic uncertainty for hiring reductions. Others, like author Cory Doctorow, believe that bosses “love the story” of AI overtaking the workforce because they want to have workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” Doctorow thinks that AI can’t successfully replace the work of many workers and there might be some evidence to back this up. An MIT study in August found that corporate AI pilots are not good at generating real revenue gains. But of course, Sankar’s observations on just how powerful AI technologies can get might be at least partially self-motivated, and Ross Douthat, the New York Times columnist interviewing him, pointed this out to Sankar pretty clearly. “Itâs in your interest, in a way, to convince yourself that the moral stakes of your work is always going to be somewhat constrained,” Douthat said. The moral backlash to their work has been something Palantir has had to deal with in recent years. Palantir’s self-proclaimed moral purpose is to build technologies to be used as a force for good, according to Sankar. That purpose is hard to grasp when seen in conjunction with Palantir’s prolific work as a defense contractor and surveillance technology provider. Sankar himself is rather passionate about “optimizing the kill chain,” something that he talks about in almost every interview, and he made sure to mention several times in this one. When asked if Palantir’s software was involved in the Trump administration’s controversial strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Sankar just said: “Yeah, our software is deployed ubiquitously across the military.” Palantir also works with the U.S. government, and particularly ICE, to help turbocharge their surveillance efforts. In August, ICE announced that Palantir would build a $30 million surveillance platform called ImmigrationOS to help with the agency’s mass deportation campaign. Then, an Amnesty International report from August found that AI products by American companies like Palantir were used by the Department of Homeland Security to target non-citizens who speak out for Palestinian rights. “I think a lot of the policies, a lot of things that people are struggling with right now in the U.S., were voted on at the ballot box. What ICE is doing was voted on at the ballot box,” Sankar said to justify the company’s involvement. When asked how Palantir determines which governments to work with and what projects to say yes to, Sankar said that they look for legal use, trust in the government, and potential for misuse and abuse. So it’s rather surprising that they have an ongoing strategic partnership with the Israeli military, whose actions in Gaza amount to a genocide according to UN authorities. Late last year, Storebrand Asset Management, a major Norwegian investor, sold all of its Palantir holdings due to concerns about international human rights violations. The company shared that an analysis indicated that Palantir aided an AI-based IDF system that ranked Palestinians based on the likelihood to launch âlone wolf terroristâ attacks, which then led to preemptive arrests. Sankar is adamant that Israel is a morally appropriate partner. Earlier this year, Sankar was among four Silicon Valley executives to join the U.S. Army Reserve as officers, the other three being Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, and current OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil. His decision to join, he says, was inspired by his “observation in Israel after Oct. 7.” “Israel is an incredibly technical country. Bountiful resources of technologists,” Sankar said. “The IDF got more modernization done in four months after Oct. 7 than in the 10 years that I’d worked with them prior.” Perhaps Palantir’s claims to being a force for good are also, in their own way, a “fundraising schtick.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Title: Creatorverse: Laid Off? Consider the Creator Economy

Time Published: 2025-10-30T19:00:00Z

As Paramount and Amazon undergo a fresh round of cuts, creators are offering new opportunities Boo! Did I scare you? Well if I didn’t, the state of Hollywood right now probably will. This past week has been a rough one. On Tuesday, Amazon announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs to keep up with this “generation of AI,” layoffs which impacted the company’s video games and publishing divisions. And then there’s Paramount. As part of the company’s new cost-cutting strategy under David Ellison, Paramount will reportedly be laying off 2,000 employees in the coming weeks. But as bleak as these axings are, there is one area that’s hiring. Yep, it’s the creator economy. From 2022 to 2024, Los Angeles employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, workers in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. As the creator space has gotten bigger, its biggest players have created their own media companies. These businesses are often created with the goal of expanding a creator’s audience and turning their reach and popularity into a more passive and sustainable revenue stream. To make that happen, a lot of these creators have been turning to Hollywood alum. And at the pace some of these creators are moving, they need good experienced people, stat. Take Sean Atkins, the president and CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, who originally came from MTV and Discovery. There’s also Corie Henson, the former head of NBC unscripted TV who moved to Beast Studios. As I’ve spoken to more creators, there seems to be a shift from solely recruiting other digitally-native personnel to bringing in people with more experience in traditional media. Or as one high-ranking creator exec told me, “They’re looking to add adults to the room.” This broadening doesn’t just apply to creator-made companies. There’s also been a boom of companies designed to support creators like Kajabi and Raptive on the tools and strategy side; Night and Digital Brand Architects on the agency side; and QYOU Media on the advertising side. If these companies haven’t already started hiring from film and television pools, they’re at least talking about it. G&B Digital Management, a creator-focused management company founded by Kyle Hjelmeseth, even hosts workshops to help actors, crew members and creatives in traditional media pivot to the creator economy. The next one is coming to Brooklyn on Nov. 12. This isn’t meant to sugarcoat a truly sucky week. Thousands of talented people are getting booted from their jobs. And the ones who are still lucky to be employed are either panicking about their futures (hello Warner Bros. Discovery!) or are spread so thin they can barely breathe. But amid all the horror, there is a small sliver of hope. Now onto the rest. Kayla Cobb Senior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com IShowSpeed freaks out over AI deepfakes MrBeast isn’t the only mega creator panicking over the state of AI. During a livestream last week, IShowSpeed (45 million YouTube subscribers) watched several deepfake videos of himself generated by Sora 2, OpenAI’s latest model. Speed admitted that giving the app permission to use his likeness publicly was a mistake and said, “Whoever told me to make it public, chat, you’re not here for my own safety, bro. I’m f–ked.” So he’s not a fan. Tubi ups its creator bets with Hartbeat and Audiochuck Tubi, the free ad-supported streamer owned by Fox, upped its creator investments in two major ways this week. First up is a deal with Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat for four movies, the streamer’s first exclusive deal for creator content. Two of the upcoming movies will come from Kinigra Deon (5.5 million YouTube subscribers) and 85 South Show (3.4 million Instagram followers). That was on Wednesday. On Thursday, Tubi announced a multiyear deal worth $150 million with Audiochuck, the media company from Ashley Flowers that’s behind “Crime Junkie,” “The Deck” and “So Supernatural.” As part of the deal, Tubi will have exclusive distribution and advertising sales rights and will develop a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel. No wonder Tubi got so many shoutouts during this quarter’s earnings call. NASCAR and Night partner on creator-focused series with TimTheTatman, Emiru and more NASCAR is tapping creators as part of its effort to expand to younger audiences. The upcoming Creator Series, launched in partnership with the digital talent agency Night, will be hosted by NASCAR analyst Mamba Smith and will see professional driver Carson Hocevar race alongside eight top creators. The creators taking the wheel include: The four-event series will run through October through February and will be available to watch across Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. TikTok creators can earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions During TikTok’s Creator Summit, the company announced creators can now earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions. As the name implies, subscriptions let fans can gain access to paywalled content from TikTok creators. The platform also introduced two new AI-powered tools. Smart Split automatically edits longer content into multiple shortform videos. Then there’s AI Outline, which helps creators generate video titles, hashtags, hooks and outlines for their videos. Netflix is experimenting with vertical videos but swears it’s not competing with TikTok At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Netflix Chief Technology Officer Elizabeth Stone said the company is starting to experiment with more vertical videos, which is home to shortform content. But Stone promised the company isn’t trying to compete with TikTok or the emerging shortform drama trend. Remember when Netflix promised it wasn’t going to have ads? Or it wasn’t going to invest in live sports? Or when it swore “Stranger Things” wasn’t coming to theaters earlier this month? So sure, Netflix. YouTube partners with Adobe, settles Disney lawsuit It was a big week for YouTube. As part of Adobe’s new slate of AI toolsfor creators, the company announced a partnership that will add a Create for YouTube Shorts option to the app version of Premiere (I’ve been trying it out, and that platform is seriously awesome). YouTube also announced a series of updates to optimize watching videos in the living room. In the past year, YouTube channels earning six-figure paydays from TV viewership increased by 45%. YouTube and Disney also settled their ongoing legal feud over Justin Connolly, the former Disney employee who’s now YouTube’s global head of media and sports. Oh, and Alphabet posted its first $100 BILLION quarter. Very casual, guys. Steven Bartlett’s company backed by Slow Ventures at a $425 million valuation Slow Ventures and Apeiron Investment Group backed Steven Bartlett’s company Steven.com at a $425 million valuation. Bartlett is behind the podcast “Diary of a CEO,” which has 13 million subscribers on YouTube and is routinely included on lists of the most listened to and watched podcasts. The exact investment amount hasn’t been disclosed. By the way, Kamala Harris stopped by Bartlett’s podcast today. Shorthand Studios hires BuzzFeed alum Zack Evans You know how at the top I said creator companies are looking to hire Hollywood talent? They’re also looking at media alum. Case in point Zack Evans, the BuzzFeed and Cameo alum who was just hired as Shorthand Studios’ VP of creative strategy. Shorthand Studios is the content and production studio under Underscore Talent. Kaya Yurieff and Jasmine Enberg launch Scalable to cover the business of the creator economy The Information’s former creator expert Kaya Yurieff is going off on her own. On Thursday, Yurieff and eMarketer alum Jasmine Enberg announced the launch of Scalable, their new venture dedicated to covering the business of the creator economy. Scalable will be partnering with The Lighthouse, Whalar Group’s creator campus. Stapleview “SNL” may wanna watch its back because Stapleview’s content has been crushing it lately. A comedy collective for up-and-coming comedians, Stapleview (198,000 TikTok followers) has already launched several internet shows like “Ad World” and “Clear the Air with Taylor Ortega.” But its latest batch of sketches have been on fire. It’s also the company behind Grace Reiter’s (3.4 million TikTok followers) “That’s Enough” podcast. Reiter is great on her own, but there’s something magical happening right now with Stapleview’s full comedy lineup. Want more? Explore WrapPRO now.

Title: ESRT Closes Q3 2025 With Strong Fundamentals But Muted Leasing Numbers
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/esrt-q3-2025-earnings-call/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T18:14:27Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) reported an increase in visitors to its eponymous building, along with fewer leases in the third quarter of 2025 as its portfolio reaches critical capacity. Net operating income from the observatory at the Empire State Building saw a modest increase to $26.5 million — up slightly compared to $24.1 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis — but it still hasn’t reached the $28.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, the real estate investment trust said Thursday. The decrease in visitations has been attributed to tourism being negatively impacted by international politics, according to ESRT. Leasing velocity across its entire portfolio, both retail and office, was down from 232,108 square feet in the second quarter to 87,880 square feet in the quarter ending Sept. 30. ESRT explained to investors during an earnings call that the drop was due to its available spaces reaching capacity. In the third quarter, ESRT’s notable lease deals included a 19,883-square-foot renewal and expansion for Jencap Group at 1350 Broadway, and a 16,402-square-foot renewal for Haver Analytics at One Grand Central Place. Occupancy increased 80 basis points to 90.3 percent across its Manhattan portfolio. ESRT reported 150,000 square feet of leases currently in negotiation, and 500,000 square feet of Manhattan office vacancies. “We have less space to lease, and a portion of our Manhattan office vacancy is held off-market in connection with our assemblage of large block opportunities at several properties in response to market demand, which will provide strong long-term results,” an ESRT spokesperson said. ESRT’s portfolio is optimized to protect against possible market contraction through layoffs at big companies like Amazon — which just cut its headcount by 14,000 people — according to ESRT Chairman Tony Malkin, who emphasized that he is in talks with enough potential new tenants that he does not see the job market being an immediate cause of concern. “Everybody we speak with comes to us for the quality of our portfolio, and several of them have migrated from what would be thought of as glass and steel buildings,” Malkin said. “We still have ongoing expansion within our portfolio from existing tenants. There are all kinds of reasons people might not expand, but we don’t see any of them playing out right now.” Funds from operations was 23 cents per diluted share compared to 26 cents in the third quarter of 2024, which equates to about $61.2 million compared to $69.2 million, respectively, over the same periods. Malkin reiterated his agnostic stance on politics, specifically in terms of how leasing could be impacted by the presumptive victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Nov. 4 mayoral election. “We do policy, not politics,” Malkin said. “So whoever shows up, whatever administration arrives, that’s the one with which we deal, and that’s where we try to both contribute to policy and do our best work from a business perspective.” But in a more direct address to the question of whether the market is vulnerable to policies from a Democratic Socialist mayor, Malkin said he is confident that the New York City market will continue to be what it has always been to people looking to build a business and a career. “New York City has and continues to be a magnet for the job-seeking college graduates, folks who want to come and make their careers and live in a vibrant environment,” Malkin said. “And by the way, those are an awful lot of today’s voters. They are the employees. The employers are here because they want those employees.” Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Amazon Ads Business Jumps 24% From Prior Year to $17.7 Billion

$33 billion: How much Amazon made in the third quarter from its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services—up 20% year-over-year and beating analyst projections. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. $17.7 billion: How much Amazon made from advertising in the second quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year. 13%: The amount that Amazon’s total net sales increased compared to last year’s Q3 earnings, to $180.2 billion. $1.8 billion: What Amazon expects to pay in severance fees related to layoffs, which started this week when the company announced cuts of around 14,000 corporate jobs. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal both reported that the total number of affected jobs is expected to hit 30,000. -69%: The drop in Amazon’s free cash flow—down to $14.8 billion versus the $47.7 billion reported in Q3 last year—largely due to capital investments related to artificial intelligence. 60%: Increase in the number of rural communities that have access to Amazon’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery over the last four months. 250 million: How many people have used Rufus, Amazon’s generative AI shopping assistant, so far this year. The company claims people who use Rufus are 60% more likely to complete a purchase. $2.5 billion: The settlement Amazon had to pay this quarter after the FTC proved it misled people and made it exceedingly difficult to cancel subscriptions. CEO Andy Jassy kicked off Amazon’s Q3 earnings call by discussing AWS, the company’s cloud-computing business, noting that the 20% growth rate is a return to a pace the company hasn’t seen since 2022. He also teased “several” new AWS deals signed in October that haven’t yet been announced. “AWS is where the preponderance of companies data and workloads reside, and part of why most companies want to run AI on AWS,” Jassy said. The AWS growth numbers outpaced analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares jumped as much as 14% in after-hours trading. The company still has more demand for AWS services than it has capacity for, however. Currently, the bottleneck is in power, Jassy said, though it could at some point shift to chips. Amazon has added 3.8 gigawatts of power to its AWS infrastructure in the last year, with another gigawatt coming in Q4. For its advertising division, Amazon highlighted deals with Netflix, Spotify, and SiriusXM. The ads business saw 24% growth from the year prior, to $17.7 billion in revenue. Agentic commerce is coming. While it’s become very easy to buy things online when you know what you want, a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages over ecommerce when you don’t know exactly what you want, Jassy explained in response to an investor question about agentic. But that’s going to change as AI agents get better at guiding online shopping experiences, he said. “AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online,” Jassy said. “That’s really good for customers, and I think it’s really good for Amazon, because at the end of the day, you’re going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably.” Kathryn Lundstrom is ADWEEK’s commerce and sustainability editor.

Title: The Great VC Reshuffle: OpenAI’s $500B Restructuring, A16z’s $10B Mega-Fund, and Why Two-Thirds of Series B Investments Fail

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back!! 20VC x SaaStr with Harry, Rory and Jason! Bottom Line Up Front: Three seismic shifts hit venture this week. OpenAI completed the most significant corporate restructuring in tech history, clearing the path for a potential $2 trillion IPO while Sam Altman keeps zero equity. Andreessen Horowitz raised $10 billion—but when you break down the individual funds, they’re more beatable than the headlines suggest. And new data proves what great investors always knew: two-thirds of Series B investments return less than 2x, making picking more critical than ever. Meanwhile, companies like Mercor hit $500M in revenue in record time, and the debate over when founders should sell intensifies as regulatory risk reshapes M&A. The big news this week: OpenAI successfully cut deals with Microsoft, Delaware, and California attorneys general to implement their long-awaited restructuring. They’re now a proper public benefit corporation (PBC)—similar to Patagonia—with a $135 billion charitable foundation owning roughly 20%, Microsoft owning 27%, and employees owning another 20%+. What This Actually Means: The most shocking detail? Sam Altman will have zero equity in the restructured entity. Think about that for a moment—we’re simultaneously watching Elon Musk argue for a trillion-dollar pay package while the CEO of OpenAI owns nothing in a $500 billion company. Jason Lemkin noted the absurdity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll explained the power dynamics: “It gives him in some ways more power as well as less power. You can’t assail the man for capitalism when his other billion-dollar entities are the ones that let him finish off the McLaren collection.” Microsoft emerges as a clear winner, turning their $13 billion investment into a 10x return with ongoing revenue share and Azure contracts. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” The charitable foundation also wins big—$135 billion is, as O’Driscoll put it, “a significant contribution to whatever good they hopefully will do with that money. There’s $135 billion out there that’s not going into someone’s pockets to buy yachts, boats and football teams. It’s actually going to try and solve world’s problems.” He added the historical perspective: “I would have laughed in 2016 at the people who started OpenAI saying we want to do good for the world. But at a big picture level they succeeded—they built something worth $130 billion which is a foundation that they can be proud of.” Here’s where it gets interesting for founders and investors: OpenAI now has a clear path to what could be the most popular retail IPO in history. Lemkin was direct: “I just can’t think of a retail IPO that would be more popular than OpenAI. Just bringing everyone out of the woodwork to put a little bit of their life savings into it—to ignore even if the valuation makes no sense. This would have to be the most popular retail IPO of all time, right?” O’Driscoll agreed: “I think you’re exactly right. People aren’t going to be reading the prospectus and saying maybe we won’t make profits. They’re not going to be reading the thing about $250 billion of cloud commits to third parties. They’re just going to be like, let me get some of that OpenAI.” Current math: At $500 billion with roughly $12 billion in revenue, they’re trading at ~40x revenue. O’Driscoll broke down the trajectory: “At even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion… It’s kind of, you know, 40 times gap and if it’s 20 billion it’s 25 times AR run rate. My guess is it would take two years in the normal course but you might see that euphoria moment. It’s within the trajectory, it’s within the strike zone if anything like the current growth rate continues.” But he added the critical caveat: “If you’re trading at 40 times revenues and your growth rate slows, it’s nasty and you fall sheer.” Lemkin pointed out another crucial advantage: “This unlocks maybe four times more equity for them potentially if the public markets are different than the private because of the potential valuation they could IPO. They may need that—they may need an extra 200 billion to go the distance.” O’Driscoll noted the banker feeding frenzy to come: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak and calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Everyone’s talking about a16z’s massive $10 billion fundraise, but when you break down the funds, it’s actually more reasonable than the headline suggests: Lemkin had the contrarian take: “I thought they were small. And what I mean is I didn’t think it was small until I saw the breakdown of the funds. At first when we talked about this before, I’m like 10 billion—that’s unprecedented. But when I look at that and the new Sequoia fund, $200 million Sequoia seed fund—that’s not that big compared to 20 VC… 1.5 billion for AI apps when you’re investing in 11 labs and friends and Replit doesn’t seem to get you very far.” He continued: “When you break apart the funds, I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has. And I don’t think one and a half billion for their AI app funds—I think it’s only twice the scale. So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” The Red Army Strategy O’Driscoll provided the big picture: “Andre Andreessen Horowitz is the red army of the venture industry now. They got the 10 billion and they’re going to march it forward. The amount of self-knowledge embodied in that is stunning. There’s one of my favorite expressions from the Russian Red Army which is quantity has a quality all its own. In other words, when you want to take Berlin, at some point what you do is you just get two million people willing to die and you march them forward.” But he also acknowledged the scale advantages: “It’s not of course it’s 10 billion. It’s 10 billion of 30% carry and 10 billion of 2% fees and 10 billion of all this. The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Harry Stebbings added the structural insight: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity.” O’Driscoll explained the optionality advantage: “You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. If you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high. The more bankroll you have to build up option value… the more option value you have at the back end because you have a $10 trillion fund, the easier it is to spray because you can amortize the cost of the losses over the one winner.” Stebbings noted the LP dynamic most don’t understand: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” O’Driscoll summed it up: “Bundling and rent extraction is fully understood.” While everyone obsesses over foundation models, Mercor quietly hit $500 million in revenue faster than any company in history—just 17 months to reach that milestone. They’re now valued at $10 billion, up from $2 billion just eight months ago. What They Actually Do: O’Driscoll explained the business: “They provide humans with specialist knowledge to—and their customers are the large foundation model companies—and what they do is they bring this human talent to bear to help the foundation model companies train the models by providing human feedback. You people would have heard RLHF—reinforcement learning through human feedback—these are the humans that do that.” He continued: “If I’m OpenAI and I want to teach my latest model how to do advanced math, what I need is a whole bunch of doctorates and PhDs who understand math that are available to pose questions to the model, judge model questions, give feedback on which answer is correct. By doing that, you effectively—by giving this human feedback—I think of it as you pound the model into submission where it eventually says, ‘Okay, I’ve learned this shit by adjusting the weights.'” The evolution is stunning: “Five years ago, we were labeling cats. And you had people often overseas charged with labeling cats and not getting a lot of money. I think Mercor realized that the market today is not labeling cats. It’s in fact answering complex physics questions, math questions, bio questions because the models know how to label cats now and what they need to do is the outer edges of human knowledge.” The Bull Case: Stebbings broke down the expanding value proposition: “It all started with talent acquisition—if you got the talent and could provide it, fantastic. We’ll pay you. Pillar two is get the talent, now we want data acquisition—you provide it to us, not we extract it. And you measure the quality of it too. And now we’re adding the third pillar, which is the implementation layer—we expect you to implement it efficiently and make sure our models get off the ground more effectively. And with that, you also see increased pricing and the willingness to spend much, much more from the model providers.” O’Driscoll on the growth opportunity: “The growth isn’t surprising because if you think about it, these model companies have grown faster than any company in human history. They’re spending $400 billion on compute. They’re probably spending $4 billion dollars on RLHF and they were spending zero five years ago. It’s an explosive growth market.” The Bear Case: But Stebbings identified the concentration risk: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue. So there is real revenue concentration there. It’s high quality customers but you do have that dynamic as well.” O’Driscoll was even more direct on the structural challenges: “Your margin profile is not amazing because the gross revenue is 500 million but you give 70% of it to the doctors and the mathematicians who are doing all whatever it is—some percentage I’m not going to speculate—and then the second fact you have against you is massive customer concentration. And at some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million,’ right?” He concluded with the ultimate framing: “From a long-term value extraction perspective, you prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two. When you look at those positives and negatives, this is fundamentally a bet that the AI capex train will keep running for two or three or four more years.” Lemkin added the timeline caveat: “OpenAI is not going to focus on getting efficient until it’s dealt with hyperrowth. So as long as it’s not getting efficient, you probably can lean in. If it slows down, then the positives—which is the growth rate—goes away and then all the negatives come back to bite you.” On the valuation at $10 billion with $500M revenue, Stebbings noted: “It’s only 20 times revenue. So like it doesn’t seem—this is where actually we’re seeing revenue compression.” But O’Driscoll provided the sobering underwriting math: “You should be underwriting anything to a 3x. So you got to be 30 billion to make it worth your while and 30 billion… at even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion. You’re underwriting a lot of training data.” Ramp raising again at $30 billion (up from $23 billion) prompted questions about whether constant fundraising is now just part of the playbook. Why The Skepticism: Lemkin was blunt: “To me, going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough. Let’s say I was a seed investor, I’ve probably had a token of dilution. So let’s imagine I’m down to 2%, which would be great. I have a $400 million position at the last round. Right now, it’s worth $480 million with dilution after this next round. I mean, it’s a lot, but it’s not doubling my position like a classic round is.” He continued: “These little rounds—22, 25, 30—and with a lot of AI companies, a lot of dilution or a lot of others, you could see 10% annual dilution in these companies or more. You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share. It’s possible. I just don’t really care about these micro step-ups that look great—you’re like 30 billion—well if the last round was at 10, impressive. If the last round’s at three like Mercor, impressive. Here I’m like, meh, that’s cute.” Why It Makes Sense: O’Driscoll explained the capital needs: “There does appear to be a combination of insane demand for the stock, an ability to use that to create this aura of inevitability. And this is more than most companies—this is one where constant growth requires lots of capital because you’re in a capital advancing business. So you probably have every dollar you add of revenue takes $5 of capital because you got to finance purchases—you’re effectively recreating Amex. So it may well be that there’s a larger demand for capital here than the average deal.” On the valuation progression, he noted: “Someone’s lending you $4 billion of that, they’re probably going to want a $1 billion equity cushion. Going from 23 billion to 30 billion… let’s say I was a seed investor with 2%—I have a $400 million position at the last round, right now it’s worth $480 million with dilution.” The Public vs Private Debate: O’Driscoll made a critical distinction: “Another spin on what you’re saying is with the exception of the new AI companies, that probably is the kind of IRR you should expect to get in a mature growth private company. There’s really early and late stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public, could just as easily be a small midcap stock at this point in time public.” He continued: “You don’t expect midcap stocks to gap up 3x in a year—you expect the overall market will go by 11%, the best companies grow 30-40% year-on-year. There’s no reason to assume that the return to the stock should be different just because it’s held in a different corporate structure. The company is the company independent if it’s public or private.” Lemkin countered: “You just said we’re still underwriting Harry asked you what we’re underwriting to. You said at least 3x. So if I’m going to underwrite to 3x and I did the last Ramp round at 23, it’s not really getting me to my 3x.” O’Driscoll clarified: “You’re confusing your pronouns. You’re trying to underwrite to a 3x. If you’re running money doing companies at 30 billion pre, you’re probably not underwriting to an overall 3x on your fund. I don’t think you are underwriting to a 3x when you’re doing ultra late stage billion-dollar revenue run rate $30 billion valuations and you’re definitely not underwriting to a 30% IRR.” New data from Carter looked at all 547 Series B investments from 2018. The results are sobering for anyone who thinks picking doesn’t matter. The Distribution: The Math: O’Driscoll analyzed the data: “If you hit those three buckets correctly, the blended return—I know it from our fund model—is 3.7x gross, 3x net to the LP. So if you look at that business, if you get enough slots in the buckets, right, in each of the buckets—the good buckets, the 5x bucket and the 10x bucket—you end up with a 3x net to the LP. So the first piece of good news is if you do it right, the return was available to you.” But he emphasized the picking challenge: “Jason picked on the negative which is two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. And what it says is picking is so important because if you skew instead of 66%, if you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” The Brutal Truth About Series B: Only 1 in 3 Deals Even Double Investors’ Money, Per Latest Carta Data Does Spray and Pray Work? Lemkin disagreed with the spray characterization: “At series B, everyone thinks they’re a great picker, don’t they? This isn’t pre-seed. Everyone’s a great picker at series B, right?” O’Driscoll responded: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. I think if you don’t pick, if you’re not a good picker, you will end up with more… If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off. I don’t think the spray and pray strategy would work here.” He identified three distinct strategies: “There’s actually three approaches. There’s picking, there’s spraying, and then the third one which someone big like Andre can do which is optioning. You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. But if you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high.” On the a16z seed strategy with 72 seed bets (compared to number two at 27), Stebbings noted: “Exactly to your point there, Rory, you said you can’t win without being a great picker. I’m not saying Andre are not great pickers, but you can if you have 72 option bets.” O’Driscoll agreed: “There are three strategies. There’s spraying, picking, and optioning. Optioning allows you to spray more. Once upon a time, you thought seed was all about option value and anything beyond that wasn’t. Because we’re dealing with gargantuan sums of money, it is now plausible that for some people A’s and B’s are partially options. If you’re going to deploy $200 million in the growth round, you don’t want to be totally slipshod at the A and the B, but you can think of it as more option value. That’s absolutely a superpower that a wall of money gives you.” Even at Seed: On whether spray works at seed, O’Driscoll did the math: “Going back to the Carter data, there were 547 series B’s in 2018. I’m going to guess graduation rate probably implies 800 A’s. That probably implies 1,600 seeds. So even what you are pejoratively calling spray and pray is doing 50 deals out of 1,600. There’s still a huge element of picking involved in that.” He identified the only exception: “The only people on the planet who have a structural business where they can de-emphasize picking because they can write checks—option checks at scale—is Y Combinator because they have a structured advantage in terms of their economics. They are the only people who’ve built a mass production seed business.” On why even the single best outcome doesn’t justify true spray: “It’ll always be true that if you pick the single largest outlier in any vintage—like if one of those deals was Figma where the B made 100x—even if it’s 300x, if you did an index and did every deal equally, it’s only a 0.2x. If you put a dollar into everything, your Figma check doesn’t return the fund. Maybe an OpenAI would—maybe there is one deal so big that it would literally return the vintage such that if you just bought the entire vintage you’re good—that probably happens maybe once every decade or two.” Synthesia, the AI video generation company at $150M ARR, reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Adobe. They’re now raising north of $3 billion instead. The Case for Selling: Lemkin was direct: “I would tell him to take it unless you’re 100% sure you’re going to build a $20 billion public company, $10 billion public company. And if you are, do it. I like to stress the test. So I’m not saying that’s the right thing to do, but I want to be the guy that gives that advice.” He continued: “Even 10 is not really worth it for a founder. It is worth it for the VCs. Excel gets another play. 3 to 10 for Excel—huge difference. So let’s say they own 15% out of a—what—$450 million fund. Instead of a 1x fund returner, it could be a two or 3x. You make that bet as a VC all day long. For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference.” On the reality of wealth: “We’ve had billionaires on our show. You’ve had billionaires, Harry. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money. It’s the same dude.” The Underrated Question: Lemkin raised the question no one asks: “There’s another thing that’s under-discussed and I’ve had this conversation twice with founders in the last 12 to 18 months in similar situations: Are you really an IPO guy? I love everything about this company, I love the founders, I love everything. There’s nothing negative. And I told them to take the offer even though I didn’t want them to as an investor. I told them to take the offer because I said, ‘You’re such a great set of founders, but I don’t know if today I see you living the public company CEO life. I just don’t see it—the way you have to do it, the constraints, the stress.'” He explained the stakes: “You have to assume it’s IPO or bust. And if you’re not that guy, then you’re going to bring in an outside CEO or it’s just a mess. So that’s the question I have: Do you really want to run a public company for real?” On the weight of being public: “I was at this Dreamforce Benioff dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know that have all been on Harry’s show and Rory’s invested in some of them. And it was great and it was fun. I got some hugs. But man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight—they weren’t stressed, no one was stressed—the weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” The Case for Taking the Risk: O’Driscoll provided the growth analysis: “Victor, I admire Synthesia enormously as a company. We tried to contact them—they didn’t get back to me. They got the deal done. I’m so disappointed. We have another investment in the space. I love the space. I admire Synthesia a ton and many of the investors there. I think the first question is how do you feel about the business? And you threw out a statistic there—they said they’re at 100 million in ARR when they took the Adobe money in April. I checked. And if they really have gone from 100 to 150 in less than 6 months, then I can make this conversation really quick. There’s no way they should sell because that thing’s exploding.” He added the category perspective: “It’s a great category. There’s a reason we made another investment in the space. We like the category. I think there’s runway there for that kind of human interface to compute.” On the LP pressure question, Lemkin pushed back: “I don’t believe that. I don’t see it. I’ve asked my LPs, I’ve asked a few others. If you’re a strong manager—okay, if you have a track record and their goal is not a 3x seed fund, but if they really want 5x or north out of you—they get the game is you got to keep playing another card. No matter what they say, I’ve asked my LP and I guess it’s a small set—do you want more money back? Even ask my most conservative LP like a university endowment that is small, that has stress—I ask you want your money back, I mean with a gain—they’re like no, we’re just telling you we’re really worried about it, like we really want DPI but we don’t want it. We want you to play another card.” O’Driscoll summarized the board conversation: “I always tell the CEO, ‘Now would be a really good time for you to look into your own heart and see how you feel. And if there’s something about the business that’s really worrying you and you haven’t told us, now would be a good time to share.’ And sometimes stuff comes out.” Stebbings added the regulatory timeline dimension: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ By which time I’ll be $400 million in revenue being acquired for $3 billion. You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times.” Amazon announced their largest white-collar layoffs ever (10% of corporate staff), is losing cloud market share (from 50% in 2018 to 38% today), and had a major AWS outage causing billions in damage. The Timing Question: O’Driscoll noted: “Contrast this with Sergey Brin coming back to Google, everything else happening. Maybe this was a tough time for your founder to leave and go to Miami. Maybe this was not—maybe it seemed like a very stable time to do a transition. Long time as CEO, but maybe this wasn’t the perfect age of maybe stepping down just before AI hit was suboptimal for Amazon.” Lemkin provided historical context: “Jeff Bezos checked out right at the peak of the last era when products were frozen in time for a decade, when AWS was the same product for a year. So are most of the companies we invested in all three of us in 2021—they were the same products as 2015. It was the great time to go to Miami because nothing was changing in the product. It was just going—just stock prices were going up in revenue, but the products were the same. So why wouldn’t you retire? There’s not going to be any change.” The Counterargument: O’Driscoll offered the alternative view: “Or maybe it was brilliant for Jeff because maybe the hook—because you’re implying in that that had he stayed all these bad things wouldn’t have happened. And it’s plausible just given his world top two or three entrepreneurial achievement of the last three decades.” But then he turned cynical: “When you’ve got a couple hundred billion dollars, my guess is you’re not maximizing money. You’re maximizing psychic pain and joy. My guess is his psychic joy in the last three or four years doing what he’s been doing has been significantly higher than the psychic pain that would have been involved in realizing you’ve never done a big acquisition in your life, you got to do a huge corporate deal in AI to matter, and all those people you hired in ’21 trying to do the right thing for COVID and expand—you all got to lay them off.” Lemkin was even blunter: “I think Bezos would lay off half his company in a fortnight if it was the right thing. I don’t think you even care.” The Problem Analysis: O’Driscoll broke down Amazon’s challenges: “The first problem is in their retail business they overinvested for COVID and now they’re trying to replace people with robotics because the technology is there and that’s just something that had to be done. And in cloud it’s less that their core AWS business has folded up. It’s like all the new compute which is 10x and 20x larger in terms of demand for these customers is AI-related compute and you’ve neither built something compelling standalone nor have you partnered—except to be fair a little bit with Anthropic. You didn’t make a meaningful partnership and you haven’t found a way to get some of that compute.” On the hyperscaler comparison: “Of the three hyperscalers in the pre-AI world, Google was able to be relevant because they had their own model. Microsoft went and rented a model from OpenAI and now the contract’s nearly up and they did it to make a lot of capital gain but they didn’t actually in my view really develop something compelling that they own from it. And you did nothing—so you lose.” Lemkin added perspective: “One thing we shouldn’t do here and you saw a lot of it with Google too is that you don’t want to overcompensate. There’s a bunch of bad news in one day and it is bad. But your position in retail is broadly good. You’re a little schlocking in terms of shopping experience but you have dominance because of your distribution and you’re doubling down on that. You’re reinvesting in robotics, you’re cutting costs. Amazon wins in their retail business because they can deliver shit faster than anyone else on the planet pretty much anywhere and you’re doubling down on that. So that’s like a win on the compute business on the AWS business. Your problem is you just—you’re not relevant in the new world. So just knuckle down and figure that out.” iRobot (Roomba) had a $1.7 billion acquisition offer from Amazon blocked by the EU “because of an incipient monopoly in the house vacuum cleaner marketplace,” as Benedict Evans sarcastically noted. The company raised $200 million in debt to bridge the deal. Now that debt is spent and they’re likely going bankrupt. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “It’s a horrible and unfair outcome for which the government and Lina Khan and the FTC is entirely responsible based on an outdated, stupid, and foolish belief about how things work beyond doubt.” The M&A Lesson: Lemkin explained the broader implication: “It’s also a reminder that when you’re going to the M&A offer like Synthesia, sometimes you’ll get the acquirer will pay a multiple that only sort of kind of makes sense—a revenue multiple that makes sense for them but you couldn’t get. And so when you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” Stebbings added the timeline problem: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ This prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions.” O’Driscoll provided the math: “Everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, you got a 2.5x in 6 months.’ No, you didn’t. You got a 2.5x in 2 years. And this prolongs—this antitrust—this prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions and at the margin probably pushes people to either push on or in the case of the crazy deals when the acquirer only wants the people, then they do the Silicon Valley acqui-hire routine. But when you’re buying the vacuum cleaner company, you want the freaking vacuums.” The conversation turned to a technical but critical question: Should investors optimize for IRR or multiple? Stebbings made the case for duration: “That duration period is also why I think it’s our responsibility as early-stage managers to be much more proactive in secondary markets because we get cash back way sooner. And the age-old thing of a 4x fund over 17 years is the same as a 2.5x fund over 10—and duration matters and time matters and IRR is king.” O’Driscoll provided the mathematical answer: “It’s not the only king because—I mean back to Jason’s comment—look, in this very show Jason was going, ‘Oh, it’s only a 30% IRR Ramp from the 22 billion to 30 billion.’ From an IRR perspective that looks amazing. So I don’t think IRR matters. I actually think the correct formulation of the optimization function is the maximization of multiple subject to a constraint on a minimum IRR.” He explained: “Basically you should know what your target IRR is—and let’s just say it’s 25%—you want to maximize the multiple provided you don’t dip below 25%. That’s actually what you’re trying to do. So a 30% IRR in one year isn’t as good as a 25% IRR for four years. But if you hold on too long and that 25 starts dipping to 19, 18, 17, then you’ve gone to a different place.” The reasoning: “In the end you want the maximum amount of capital to invest and you get that because you are held accountable at the investor level at the IRR basis because at some point they’re looking at you, they’re looking at the public markets and they’re saying risk-adjusted I need my 20%. So it is the constraint because it’s what prevents money from coming down the spigot to you but you’re actually trying to maximize your multiple.” The mega-funds are real and here to stay. But as Lemkin pointed out, when you break down their individual fund sizes, “I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has… So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” O’Driscoll agreed but added the caveat: “The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Revenue multiples are compressing for mature companies. As Lemkin noted, “Going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough… You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share.” Understanding your per-share price, not just company valuation, is critical. Stebbings emphasized: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue.” When a strategic acquirer offers a premium multiple, think hard about whether you’re really an IPO CEO. Lemkin’s advice: “Are you really an IPO guy? Can you really run a—do you really want to run a public company for real? The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today.” But understand the VC incentive misalignment: “For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference. We’ve had billionaires on our show. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money.” Factor in 18-24 months for regulatory review on any significant acquisition. O’Driscoll: “You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times, and it’s just not going to feel that much.” And as iRobot shows, Lemkin noted: “When you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” The Carter data confirms what great investors always knew: picking matters. O’Driscoll: “Two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off.” Companies like Mercor with massive customer concentration can grow incredibly fast, but as O’Driscoll warned: “At some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million.’ You prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two.” OpenAI IPO Watch: O’Driscoll: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Mega-Funds Everywhere: The venture industry is bifurcating. O’Driscoll: “This is the dominant modality today. These are—this is what top dog venture investing looks like. This kind of scale, this kind of dollars at work and there’s four or five other firms doing this.” AI Capex Super-Cycle: Everything from Mercor to OpenAI to AWS vs Azure is a bet on continued AI infrastructure spending. O’Driscoll: “This whole thing top to bottom is one big-ass bet on AI capex hyperrowth and as long as it keeps happening… you got to stay on the floor and keep dancing.” As Chuck Prince famously said in 2007: “As long as the music is playing, you got to get up and dance.” Private Staying Private: Companies like Stripe, Brex, and Ramp are staying private far longer than historical norms. O’Driscoll explained why: “There’s really early and late-stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public.” The venture game is evolving faster than ever. The winners will be those who understand not just what’s changing, but why it’s changing—and what that means for where the puck is going, not where it’s been. Jason Lemkin on Sam Altman Having Zero Equity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion-dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll on Microsoft’s Win: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” Harry Stebbings on LP Bundling: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” Rory O’Driscoll on The Spray and Pray Myth: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” Jason Lemkin on Public Company CEO Stress: “I was at this Dreamforce dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know… and man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” Harry Stebbings on A16z’s Structural Advantages: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not convinced. "This is different," Powell told reporters on Wednesday when asked about applying any lessons from the 1990s dot-com crash to today's AI boom. "If you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [era], these were ideas rather than companies," he added. "So, there's a clear bubble there. Whereas—I won't go into particular [tech company] names—but [today's top performers] actually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits. So it's really a different thing." In other words, Powell believes businesses like Amazon, which reported $18 billion in profit last quarter, have ongoing revenue streams to keep the companies afloat, even if their AI ambitions don't pan out. An economic bubble is the "rapid escalation in asset prices, often due to speculative behavior, followed by a sharp contraction," according to Investopedia. They're hard to identify in real-time, but lead to "significant economic consequences" once they burst. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is one of the most notable examples, along with the Japanese economic contraction in the 1980s, and the Dutch "Tulip Mania" of the 1630s. Today, it's not speculative tulip investments that would bring down the economy, but data centers. The sums of money tech companies are pouring into them are astronomical, suggesting a high level of confidence that has sent stocks soaring. Nvidia just hit the $5 trillion valuation mark. Earlier this year, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank pledged to invest $500 billion in AI data centers over the next four years via their Stargate project. Yesterday, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, while Google, Microsoft, Meta, and others have similar plans. Data centers require a small number of employees, but building them generates temporary business for suppliers and construction companies. "The investment we're getting into equipment and all the things that go into creating data centers and feeding AI, it's clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy," Powell said this week. He admitted he couldn't say if the data center investments "will work out," but does not think they will affect interest rates either way, which is his primary concern. (On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point.) Still, the AI hype is not translating into a hiring boom. Amazon just laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the need to move fast in AI (and pay for the GPUs needed to power it), which might climb to 30,000 in 2026. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI and poached its founder to lead AI at Meta, but recently laid off 600 employees as part of a team restructuring. When asked about whether AI is contributing to layoffs, Powell said it's too soon to tell, but it's an area the Federal Reserve is concerned about and watching closely. "You see a significant amount of companies announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or are actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they are talking about AI and what it can do," he said. "It could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't see it in the initial [jobless] claims data yet, but it takes some time to get in there. We are watching that very carefully, but don't see it yet." The government shutdown is further hampering efforts to secure the federal employment data report for September. In its absence, Powell referenced "anecdotal data" from earnings reports, where companies are discussing a "bifurcated economy," meaning very different activity among high-income consumers who are still spending a lot, and lower-income consumers who are tightening their belts. "We think there's something there," Powell said. Other data points the Fed is using as a proxy for the official, federal report—such as unemployment insurance claims and job listings on Indeed—show that the situation has been "stable" over the last few weeks, Powell said. Regarding tariffs, which have hit tech companies like Apple, Powell seemed cautiously optimistic. "Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation," he said. "A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived, a one-time shift in the price level. "But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent," he cautioned. "And that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem."

Title: The Fed Chair Is Not Worried About an AI Bubble. Here's Why It Differs From the 90s

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Are we in an AI bubble? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not convinced. "This is different," Powell told reporters on Wednesday when asked about applying any lessons from the 1990s dot-com crash to today's AI boom. "If you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [era], these were ideas rather than companies," he added. "So, there's a clear bubble there. Whereas—I won't go into particular [tech company] names—but [today's top performers] actually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits. So it's really a different thing." In other words, Powell believes businesses like Amazon, which reported $18 billion in profit last quarter, have ongoing revenue streams to keep the companies afloat, even if their AI ambitions don't pan out. An economic bubble is the "rapid escalation in asset prices, often due to speculative behavior, followed by a sharp contraction," according to Investopedia. They're hard to identify in real-time, but lead to "significant economic consequences" once they burst. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is one of the most notable examples, along with the Japanese economic contraction in the 1980s, and the Dutch "Tulip Mania" of the 1630s. Today, it's not speculative tulip investments that would bring down the economy, but data centers. The sums of money tech companies are pouring into them are astronomical, suggesting a high level of confidence that has sent stocks soaring. Nvidia just hit the $5 trillion valuation mark. Earlier this year, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank pledged to invest $500 billion in AI data centers over the next four years via their Stargate project. Yesterday, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, while Google, Microsoft, Meta, and others have similar plans. Data centers require a small number of employees, but building them generates temporary business for suppliers and construction companies. "The investment we're getting into equipment and all the things that go into creating data centers and feeding AI, it's clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy," Powell said this week. He admitted he couldn't say if the data center investments "will work out," but does not think they will affect interest rates either way, which is his primary concern. (On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point.) Still, the AI hype is not translating into a hiring boom. Amazon just laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the need to move fast in AI (and pay for the GPUs needed to power it), which might climb to 30,000 in 2026. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI and poached its founder to lead AI at Meta, but recently laid off 600 employees as part of a team restructuring. When asked about whether AI is contributing to layoffs, Powell said it's too soon to tell, but it's an area the Federal Reserve is concerned about and watching closely. "You see a significant amount of companies announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or are actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they are talking about AI and what it can do," he said. "It could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't see it in the initial [jobless] claims data yet, but it takes some time to get in there. We are watching that very carefully, but don't see it yet." The government shutdown is further hampering efforts to secure the federal employment data report for September. In its absence, Powell referenced "anecdotal data" from earnings reports, where companies are discussing a "bifurcated economy," meaning very different activity among high-income consumers who are still spending a lot, and lower-income consumers who are tightening their belts.

Former New World devs could find work at Riot Games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Fantasy MMO New World got the death knell from Amazon this week, as the company announced season 10 would round out updates to the game amid wider layoffs affecting some 14,000 jobs. Players and devs alike are commiserating, and now a co-founder of Riot Games has put out a call for the talent who are seeking their next gig. In the immediate wake of New World being sunsetted, someone tweeted at Marc Merrill, who co-created League of Legends and now serves as co-chair and CPO at Riot, stating that he needs to pick up some of the developers who've been set adrift. "Who are the star devs on the teams?" he says. "We're always on the lookout for S-tier talent who want to take on some of the hardest challenges and solve problems on behalf of the most dedicated players." The person who contacted Merrill states that a "Riot MMO" is a "massive need," likely referring to the online RPG the company announced in 2020. Where that project is remians up in the air, but the staff of New World probably wouldn’t be a bad fit for LoL, the still-upcoming Project F, and whatever else Riot is working on. They have experience handling a massive game through peaks and valleys, responding to the needs and wants of a global fanbase for four years. Who are the star devs on the teams? We’re always on the lookout for S-tier talent who want to take on some of the hardest challenges and solve problems on behalf of the most dedicated players. https://t.co/AeVrJ4UgjLOctober 28, 2025 Game-changing rollouts were part of their regular workload. In fact, the most recent expansion, Nighthaven, helped revive New World and put it on a more positive trajectory, making the recent turn of events even more heartbreaking, especially for players who’d stuck with Aeternum through thick and thin. In Merrill’s replies, Fabrice Condominas, an executive producer at Riot, sent the eyes emoji. With any luck, some of those now needing another opportunity can find one in the annals of Runeterra.

Title: Update on Next Tomb Raider Game Is Surprising Amid Recent News

Time Published: 2025-10-30T17:04:00Z
Full Content:
By Jonathan H. Kantor A new Tomb Raider game that’s in development received a surprising update in October 2025. Since the first Tomb Raider game arrived on the Sega Saturn in 1996, the franchise has been one of the most enduring of the past few decades. There have been multiple titles, many of which have received widespread critical acclaim, and there’s also a feature film franchise and a forthcoming Amazon Prime series starring Sophie Turner. The last mainline Tomb Raider game was Square Enix Europe’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018. Since then, a mobile game, two remasters, and a collection have become available, but no new AAA titles have been released. The next game entered development in 2022, and it just received an interesting update. In late October 2025, Amazon announced a mass layoff of 14,000 employees, which had a significant impact on Amazon Game Studios. However, according to Variety, this didn’t derail the development of the next Tomb Raider title. The as-yet untitled game was first announced by Variety in 2022, and while it seemed the game would be on the chopping block, it appears it’s been spared. The same cannot be said of Amazon Games’ previously forthcoming Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which was cancelled. Still, fans of Lara Croft and her adventure game series can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing development continues, though a release date remains elusive as of writing. The next game in the Tomb Raider franchise is being developed by Crystal Dynamics, with Amazon Games set to publish. The game will ultimately be released as a multi-platform title, although details of the story, gameplay, and other elements remain closely guarded secrets. It’s been in development for over three years, so hopefully, it’s nearing completion, but its release window is anyone’s guess. The game is said to continue Lara Croft’s story, set in an environment that rewards players for solving puzzles, creative pathfinding, and overcoming deadly enemies. Crystal Dynamics is developing the game using Unreal Engine 5. From perilous expeditions to adrenaline-filled Trials, Lara Croft is ready for every situation.The @tombraider Collection returns with two new looks: the Iconic Lara Outfit and the Shadow Runner Outfit. Now available (cont) https://t.co/wO5hNvRrr6 pic.twitter.com/wAHQugSlIQ Like other Tomb Raider games, fans can expect a strong, story-driven single-player narrative. Crystal Dynamics previously claimed its game would be transformative, and the developer is excited to team up with Amazon Studios. Following the announcement of mass layoffs at the publisher, which was launched in 2012, it seemed likely that every game currently in development would be terminated. While the layoffs did hit several titles, Tomb Raider and March of Giants, which recently completed its closed alpha, were spared. According to Bloomberg, Amazon Games is restructuring to support its cloud gaming service Luna with a focus on “casual and AI-focused games.” News of Tomb Raider’s survival brings hope to players who’ve longed to return to the familiar and beloved IP since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That game was successful, and while Crystal Dynamics, then a subsidiary of Square Enix Europe, offered support, it wasn’t a primary developer. The game featured a continued story in Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix. Now that the IP has returned to Crystal Dynamics (Now part of Sweden’s Embracer Group), there’s a lot of talent coming from a studio with a longstanding history with the franchise.

Many changes have taken place within Amazon, and some people fear that the development of the next Tomb Raider game will be affected by them. But fortunately, this does not seem to be the case. Thus, these layoffs have particularly affected Amazon's gaming division, with budget cuts for several studios. And this has caused considerable concern among players, who fear that projects currently under development will be canceled. But Steve Boom announced some good news in a note relayed by Game Rant. Amazon is still working on an open-world driving simulator and on March of Giants, which is the first game from Amazon Games Montreal. In addition, the collaboration with Crystal Dynamics continues, reassuring many fans. However, no further information has been revealed about its gameplay or its story, even though many rumors have emerged in recent months. Indeed, while we know that this will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used, some people believe that it will be an open world, offering many possibilities. But it will be necessary to wait for new information from Crystal Dynamics to confirm these rumors. Not to mention that the decisions made by Amazon in the coming months could change the projects around this game. Game Rant

Title: Jerome Powell says the AI hiring apocalypse is real: ‘Job creation is pretty close to zero’

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell drew a stark picture of a labor market that looks fine on the surface—4.3% unemployment, solid consumer spending—but is quietly losing momentum underneath. Once you adjust for statistical overcounting in the payroll data, he said during a press conference Wednesday following the FOMC meeting, “job creation is pretty close to zero.”He connected that slowdown, at least in part, to what CEOs are now openly telling investors: AI allows them to do more with fewer people. He noted “a significant number of companies” have recently announced layoffs or hiring pauses, with many of them explicitly citing AI as the reason. “Much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s rate-cut decision, warning large employers are signaling they won’t need to add headcount for years. “We’re watching that very carefully,” he added. The comments come as the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75%–4%, citing “downside risks to employment” even as inflation remains elevated. Powell said the U.S. economy is still expanding at a “moderate pace,” even as hiring slows. He described that spending as one of the “big sources of growth in the economy,” driven by companies building data centers and other equipment tied to artificial intelligence. Powell also pushed back on the idea that all that spending is amounting to another speculative bubble. He drew a clear line between today’s surge in capital expenditure and the dot-com era, noting “these companies actually have earnings.” Those projects, he said, aren’t especially sensitive to interest rates, though, since they reflect long-term bets on higher productivity. At the same time, Powell emphasized the boom creates a policy dilemma for the Fed. AI and automation are boosting output, but they’re also allowing companies to do more with fewer workers, leaving the labor market softer, even while GDP stays positive.“We have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment,” he said. “This is a very difficult thing for a central bank, because one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher.” Recent corporate announcements illustrate Powell’s warning. Amazon announced this week it laid off 14,000 middle managers—about 4% of its white-collar workforcein an effort to “remove organizational layers.” The layoffs come amid their rampant investments into AI. Target, Paramount, and other large firms followed with their own cuts. According to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report, U.S. employers have announced nearly 946,000 layoffs so far this year—the highest total since 2020—with more than 17,000 explicitly tied to AI and another 20,000 to automation.“Job creation is very low, and the job-finding rate for people who are unemployed is very low,” Powell said.The phenomenon is so widespread some economists have coined a new term—the “Great Freeze”—to describe the dismal labor market conditions. With unemployment among recent college grads topping 5%—and AI threatening to automate entry-level office jobs—many Gen Z workers are turning to graduate school as a strategic timeout. That awkward balance—strong investment but weak hiring— is now at the center of the Fed’s decision-making. Powell said the economy increasingly resembles a K-shape, with higher-income households and large corporations benefiting from strong stock markets and AI-fueled productivity gains, while lower-income consumers pull back under the weight of rising costs. He pointed to anecdotal reports from major retailers and consumer companies describing a “bifurcated economy,” in which wealthier Americans continue to spend freely but those at the bottom are trading down to cheaper goods. ““Consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said, noting the uneven effects of growth make the Fed’s balancing act even more complicated. “There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell said. “We’re navigating the tension between our employment and inflation goals as carefully as we can.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: AI Layoffs: Why Understanding Intent May Save Your Job
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/10/30/ai-layoffs-why-understanding-intent-may-save-your-job/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:14:08Z

ByJason Snyder, Contributor. The AI layoffs I first wrote about back in February have arrived. Since Meta’s cuts last week, major disruptions have begun across the AI sector, and beyond. Amazon plans to cut about 14,000 corporate roles globally, and as many as 30,000 over time (roughly 10% of its corporate workforce), as part of a restructuring tied to artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Google and other firms are also reorganizing – citing efficiency, focus and alignment with AI strategy. This isn’t just a tech correction. It’s a structural reset. As AI shifts from novelty to infrastructure, the human roles that once defined creativity, strategy and judgment are being automated or absorbed into systems that optimize for speed over understanding. And yet, there’s still one thing machines can’t own: intent, the upstream human signal that gives action purpose. Understanding and articulating intent may soon be the difference between those who shape AI and those replaced by it. The dominant AI players: Meta, Google, OpenAI, Amazon are no longer competing merely on intelligence. They’re competing on possession. Each is building an integrated loop that spans: Distribution once meant where ads were placed. Now it’s where experience is orchestrated. These models don’t just distribute information, they author it. They can create therapy sessions, games, music, fiction, or conversation tailored to a single person. They don’t just engage your mind; they train your emotions. And as they enter the physical world, embodied in robots, vehicles, wearables, and domestic devices, engagement will soon be sensorial, kinetic, and intimate. The system that writes, distributes, and monetizes the experience will also measure how your pulse, posture, or tone responds to it. That’s not an advertising ecosystem. It’s an ecosystem of human behavior. On paper, the job reductions are framed as efficiency moves, reallocating human capital to fund automation and infrastructure. Yet there’s a second-order effect worth noting: historically, waves of mass layoffs often precede efforts that show higher operating margins and signal “discipline” to investors. Meta’s 2025 cost-cutting, alongside its AI push, coincided with a strong share-price run this year. Whether that’s coincidence or choreography, it points to a deeper truth, AI isn’t just reshaping labor; it’s reshaping perception. The narrative of efficiency has become as valuable as efficiency itself. If you can show Wall Street that you’re automating the future, you don’t have to prove it’s working yet. This isn’t just a tech correction, it’s a structural shift. As AI systems evolve from novelty to infrastructure, companies are resetting human-capital priorities, reallocating talent, and signalling that automation plus consolidation is becoming the new baseline. And the significance of this magnitude reaches far beyond engineers and labs, it touches the upstream layers of agency, narrative, design, and human intention. If the roles that once defined value are shrinking, then the only remaining locus of value becomes the channel that can’t be fully automated: the intent behind the action. When the model, the medium, and the market collapse into one stack, autonomy becomes scarce. If the same company owns the intelligence, the infrastructure, and the interface, then creativity, communication, and even emotion occur inside its design space. You may feel free, but you’re acting within pre-optimized constraints. The question isn’t “Can AI replace humans?” It’s subtler: Who decides what we experience, and why? Every major platform is quietly merging its business model with its model of you. As AI systems generate news, entertainment, education, therapy, and commerce, they’re also shaping the frameworks that determine what you see, when you see it, and how you feel about it. The feed has become the factory. When model owners bolt shopping carts onto chatbots and pair inference with advertising, they don’t just mediate attention; they monetize intention. The same engine that recommends your next purchase is learning what persuades you, predicts your emotional triggers, and trains itself to keep you inside the loop. That’s the trap. The user becomes the product, the participant, and the proof of concept. Algorithms already taught us to insulate, to hate, to consume the illusion of choice. Generative AI takes that one step further, it can now manufacture the choice itself. What begins as personalization ends as programming. The danger isn’t that AI will replace your job; it’s that it will replace the space in which decisions, creativity, and dissent once lived. When meaning, money, and motivation all flow through the same systems, we stop being users and start being used. That’s where intent becomes the new field of power, and the last one not yet owned. Intent is the upstream signal, the human why that precedes the algorithmic what. It’s the one variable platforms can’t fully predict or possess. As my friend Mark Masterson, founder of the Bureau of Bad Decisions, put it to me recently as he was preparing for a talk to the Singapore AI Association: It’s a perfect description of the moment we’re in. AI isn’t killing art, design, or innovation, it’s revealing the hollow parts of them. It’s showing us where process replaced purpose, where scale drowned sincerity. When everything can be generated, the only thing that still matters is whether we meant it. Masterson is right. When every platform measures success through engagement, intent is the only metric that can tell us whether that engagement is authentic or automatic. Intent isn’t something brands can own; it’s something they can learn to recognize and measure. It becomes the independent variable of efficacy, a way to assess outcomes outside the black box of model-defined metrics. If a platform tells you a model “works,” it’s grading its own homework. Intent lets you ask a different question: Did this align with human purpose, or merely optimize for platform goals? Intent reframes success as alignment, not amplification. It’s how we separate meaning from manipulation in an environment where the algorithms increasingly speak for us. If intent is the signal, consent is the boundary, the line that defines whether interaction is mutual or extractive. In a world where AI doesn’t just read your words but your tone, gestures, and micro-expressions, consent must evolve from legal checkbox to continuous state. It must become dynamic, not static, an ongoing negotiation of access, data, and emotional bandwidth. Apple’s privacy architecture hints at this shift: it turns consent into a user-level design principle rather than a buried agreement. Likewise, the EU’s emerging AI Act and the proposed “right to explanation” are early attempts to legislate that same principle, the right to know why a model acts on your behalf. Spotify also publishes explanations of how recommendations are generated, another small move toward algorithmic transparency. Consent ensures that participation remains voluntary even as systems grow more persuasive. It re-anchors human agency in a world optimized to remove hesitation. In the frictionless economy, sameness is the side effect. Everything that’s easy begins to look the same because it’s produced by identical optimization logic. Friction, the resistance that slows execution, is what verifies intent. It’s the pause that reveals whether a purpose can withstand pressure. For brands, friction might mean transparency, restraint, or a moment of human intervention that interrupts automation. Those aren’t inefficiencies; they’re signs of integrity. When we remove friction, we don’t just accelerate; we flatten. Some leaders are already redefining what autonomy can look like in an age of consolidation. Brad Jackson, founder and CEO of Out Of Office, is one of them. His platform virtualizes production talent, turning experiential-marketing skills into modular, portable assets rather than static employment roles. Sharing his perspective with me, Jackson said: His model signals a transition: from employment as a fixed position inside a platform-owned stack to employment as a portable expression of human intent. It’s a blueprint for reclaiming control under consolidation. This isn’t poetry, it’s an operating model for the next economy. When platforms own the pipelines of content, commerce, and cognition, the only independent measure of value left is meaning, and meaning requires friction. Leaders who understand this can reclaim autonomy by managing what machines can’t: the why behind every what. 1. Measure intent, not just engagement. Engagement tells you what happened; intent tells you why. Track upstream indicators, search phrasing, timing, tone, motivation, to gauge whether behavior aligns with purpose. When a platform hands you engagement metrics, ask for intent metrics instead. 2. Design for productive friction. Frictionless systems scale fast but flatten everything they touch. The right amount of resistance creates reflection, a moment when a user chooses instead of drifting. In commerce, that might mean a confirmation step that clarifies consent; in storytelling, a pause that deepens connection. Friction turns participation into intention. 3. Treat consent as a continuous dialogue. Consent isn’t a checkbox; it’s a conversation. Every data exchange, recommendation, or model-driven touchpoint should make choice visible. Apple’s privacy prompts and Spotify’s algorithmic transparency are small but powerful examples of consent-by-design. 4. Build your own validation layer. Don’t let the platform grade its own homework. Create independent measures of success, qualitative feedback, narrative alignment, employee sentiment, that test whether technology is amplifying your intent or replacing it. Friction isn’t failure; it’s a diagnostic for authenticity. 5. Reinvest in the human interface. As AI takes over execution, value shifts to presence: empathy, creativity, and judgment. Brands that invest in conversation, care, and curiosity will stand out amid perfect automation. When every system is engineered to erase hesitation, the leaders who can pause, reflect, and act with intent will define the next era of intelligence. AI’s consolidation signals the end of technical differentiation but the beginning of philosophical differentiation. The next competitive frontier won’t be who trains the biggest model; it will be who defines the clearest why. Brands, creators, and institutions that thrive will measure not just engagement but alignment, the resonance between human intent and machine output. They’ll design consent architectures that make participation explicit. And they’ll use friction strategically, as the necessary resistance that proves authenticity. In the coming years, as generative systems evolve from companions to collaborators to co-inhabitants, teaching, healing, building, touching, the challenge won’t be how fast AI can think. It will be how faithfully it reflects what humans mean. Because when the models own the engines, the platforms, and the distribution, and soon the gestures, the voices, and the gaze, the only remaining space for human agency is before the prompt. That’s the moment of intent. And that’s where meaning, freedom, and identity still belong to us, Some thinkers are already working to rebuild the relationship between people and the systems that shape their lives. Joe Woof, co-lead of the Addiction Economy project and founder of Society Inside, is one of them. His work focuses on redesigning technology and policy frameworks so that social systems and data systems evolve together, accountable to human purpose rather than platform growth. As Woof told me, the problem runs deeper than technology: Woof’s warning reframes the stakes: this isn’t just about ethics, it’s about public health, trust, and long-term business survival. Protecting human intent isn’t simply the right thing to do; it’s the durable thing to do. Systems that honor agency and consent outperform over time because people trust them. They attract loyalty, repeat use, and genuine advocacy, the very qualities algorithms still can’t manufacture. When people feel seen rather than scanned, they stay. In capital markets, authenticity scales faster than optimization because it compounds: customers return, employees engage, and regulators back off. The same principle applies to any business that relies on data or creativity, when individuals understand how and why their participation matters, they participate more fully. Woof’s vision mirrors the argument running through this piece: intent shouldn’t just guide individuals, it should be embedded in institutions. As AI centralizes intelligence and distribution, Society Inside reminds us that true innovation is not only technical but relational, building ecosystems where choice, consent, and shared intent become competitive advantages. The workers most at risk in this wave aren’t simply those with outdated skills, they’re the ones whose work has been stripped of visible intent. AI can replicate tasks, but it can’t replicate why you do them. For many people, that “why” has been buried under bureaucracy or burnout, not lost through laziness. Understanding intent isn’t about individual heroism; it’s about rediscovering the purpose that technology can’t code. When your daily output connects to judgment, empathy, synthesis, or creative intuition, qualities no model can truly imitate, you become harder to replace. Seeing your own intent clarifies where you add meaning. It turns you from an executor into an architect, someone shaping outcomes, not just performing them. We can’t control the speed of automation or the AI layoffs that follow, but we can control how clearly we act with intent. Those who do will shape the next chapter instead of being written out of it.

Google’s YouTube is restructuring its products team in a major shift towards AI, offering voluntary buyout packages with severance to its U.S.-based employees. CNBC reports that YouTube, Google’s online video platform that has been a staple of the internet since its launch in 2005, is undergoing a significant staffing shakeup as the company pivots to focus on AI. According to an internal memo from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, the company is restructuring its products team for the first time in a decade, a move that comes as parent company Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai has urged staff to embrace AI for increased productivity. As part of the restructuring process, YouTube is offering its U.S.-based employees voluntary buyout packages that include severance pay. This decision follows a growing trend among tech giants, such as Amazon, which recently announced layoffs of 14,000 employees as the company also embraces AI. A YouTube spokesperson stated, “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI,” claiming that no roles are being eliminated with the restructure, despite buyouts being offered to staff. Instead, the company aims to reorganize its teams to better align with its AI-driven future. The move towards AI is not unique to YouTube and Amazon. Many tech companies are recognizing the transformative potential of this technology, with some even calling it the most significant advancement since the advent of the internet. However, this shift has also raised concerns about the impact on the workforce, as evidenced by the layoffs and restructuring at various tech giants. In a memo shared publicly, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Read more at CNBC here.
