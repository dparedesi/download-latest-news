Title: October Layoffs the Worst Since 2003

Time Published: 2025-11-06T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
Layoffs in the US have reached recession-level numbers, reports the Washington Post, which cites new data from the private firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas to back that up: So far this year, employers have announced 1.1 million job cuts, a figure in line with the Great Recession of 2008-09, and the biggest number since the pandemic. Layoffs are up 65% over last year, per Reuters. October alone saw more than 153,000 cuts—a 183% jump from the previous month, per the Post—making it the worst October for layoffs since 2003. "We're entering new territory with these layoffs in October," says John Challenger, the firm's CEO. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009." The hardest-hit sectors include technology, retail, warehousing, and service. Technology firms, in particular, have cited the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence as a factor, with tech layoffs up 17% from last year. Despite the spike in layoffs, the broader economy appears stable for now, per the Post. The most recent official data puts the unemployment rate at 4.3%, though economists warn that conditions could deteriorate quickly. In fact, the rate is expected to reach 4.5% in the coming months, per CBS News.

Layoffs in the U.S. rose sharply in October 2025 as companies tried to save money and adjust to new AI technology. Many big firms, including tech companies, reduced jobs. Experts say rising costs and slower spending are also reasons for the cuts, making it harder for people to find new work this year.

Title: Monthly job cuts surged to a 22-year high in October
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/job-cuts-layoffs-october-challenger-rcna242306
Time Published: 2025-11-06T14:58:02Z
Full Content:
news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time U.S.-based companies announced more than 153,000 job cuts in October, the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008," the firm said in a news release. From January through the end of October, employers have announced the elimination of nearly 1.1 million jobs. It's the most Challenger has recorded since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the global economy. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month," Andy Challenger, the firm's chief revenue officer, said in a statement. The last time there was a higher October monthly total was in 2003. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he said. On Wednesday, the private payroll processor ADP released its own October jobs data, showing that employers added just 42,000 jobs in the month. The ADP report also flagged job losses in the leisure and hospitality sector as a potential sign of trouble ahead, given the industry’s acute sensitivity to consumer sentiment. ADP's chief economist called the losses in hospitality and leisure a "concerning trend." Both Challenger and ADP's reports landed as major companies such as Amazon, IBM, UPS, Target, Microsoft, Paramount and General Motors announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Despite the wave of downbeat economic news, the Trump administration continues to deliver an upbeat take on the current environment. “Jobs are booming” and “inflation is falling,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. However, the most recent available data paints a different picture. Inflation has also been on the rise. Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index overall have risen every month since April. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Challenger report. Challenger’s report does not typically carry the same weight with economists and investors as federal jobs data, owing to its methodology. To arrive at its figures, the firm compiles the number of job cuts companies have publicly announced. But employers may not ultimately carry out all the cuts they roll out. Moreover, some of the job cuts that multinational companies announce could affect workers outside of the United States. Other headcount reductions could be achieved through attrition, rather than layoffs. The report also may not capture smaller layoffs over the long run. But in the midst of a federal data blackout caused by the government shutdown, Challenger’s latest report is being read more closely than usual. The federal government's October jobs report that would traditionally be released Friday will not be published this week, due to the shutdown. Other key data about the U.S. economy like GDP and an inflation indicator called PCE, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, has also been delayed. Challenger equated the impact of AI on the current labor market to the rise of the internet in the early aughts. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” it said. "Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures," Challenger said. But even firms that are not actively cutting jobs have warned that they do not plan to add to their headcount in the near term, with several pointing directly to AI’s impact on their personnel needs. On Wednesday night, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN that headcount at his company would likely remain steady as the nation's largest bank rolls out AI internally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also recently told his employees that the firm would "constrain headcount growth through the end of the year," as it takes advantage of AI efficiencies, Bloomberg reported.

Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based employers cut more than 150,000 jobs in October, marking the biggest reduction for the month in more than 20 years, a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday as industries adopt AI-driven changes and intensify cost cuts. Tech firms led the job cuts in the private sector, followed by retailers and the services sector, the global outplacement company said. Cost-cutting was the top reason for the layoffs in October, followed by artificial intelligence, while “DOGE Impact” was the leading reason for job cuts in 2025. The layoffs in October surged 175% from a year ago to 153,074. From the start of the year to October end, employers have announced 1,099,500 job cuts, a 65% rise from 664,839 in the same time period last year. So far this year, job cuts are at the highest level since 2020 when 2,304,755 cuts were announced through October. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Not only did individual companies announce large layoffs in October, but a higher number of companies announced job cut plans, Challenger said, tracking nearly 450 individual job cut plans in October compared to under 400 in September. Any economic data from private sources will be on investors’ radar as official data continues to be absent with the U.S. government now entering its longest-ever shutdown.

Δ That’s a 175% jump from October of 2024 and 183% higher than the 54,064 cuts announced in September of this year, per a Thursday (Nov. 6) report by outplacement and executive coaching company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and the company’s chief revenue officer, said in a news release. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” The report also notes that October’s total is the highest for that month since October of 2023, which saw a surge of layoffs in the retail space because of acquisitions, and in telecommunications as cell phones became more popular. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Challenger. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue He added the onset of social media has allowed workers to share their negative work experience, meaning the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays faded away, “a practice that seemed particularly cruel.” Among the companies cutting jobs last month was Amazon, which said it planned to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate roles. The report comes one day after the announcement of planned Senate legislation that would require major companies and federal agencies to report artificial intelligence-related layoffs, hires, job displacements, retraining and other impacts to the Labor Department. The bill would also require the DOL to compile data on AI-related job effects and publish a report to Congress and the public, according to a press release issued Wednesday (Nov. 5) by the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Meanwhile, research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Generation AI: Why Gen Z Bets Big and Boomers Hold Back” found that among people who use generative AI, 33% are worried that the technology might threaten people’s jobs. That concern is most pronounced among Generation Z, with 38% of the gen AI users in that age bracket worried about the impact on employment. The report said Gen Z users tend to have — or are looking for — the types of entry-level jobs that the technology can most easily replace.

Title: AI open letter by Amazon workers
URL: https://www.amazonclimatejustice.org/open-letter
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:49:42Z
Full Content:
Amazon coworkers: sign our open letter below to tell Amazon leadership that we need a more responsible rollout of AI. Every single signature makes our message stronger. In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond. We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth. We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm: Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas. Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional. Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance. All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need. We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following: No AI with dirty energy.No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments. No AI without employee voices.We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact. No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine. The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are. This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of. Signed, The Amazon employees below I signed the letter, what else can I do to help? Fill out our Get Involved form! We have a lot of work ahead to hold leadership accountable and we need all the help we can get. If you don’t work at Amazon, click here tosign on to a solidarity statement. I'm not an Amazon employee! What can I do? Your support can still help to strengthen our message to Amazon leadership. Click here to sign on anonymously to our solidarity statement. I’m signing with my name and personal contact info -- can Amazon see my name? Who’s going to have access to my information? Your contact info is confidential: we will not share it with Amazon or anyone else. We are asking for it so we can contact you with updates and to verify you work at Amazon. When at least 1,000 employees have signed the letter, we will publish the roles and orgs of all signatories, not names. We will not publish any employee names. I’m scared to sign. What are the risks? We will never share your name with Amazon or with anyone else. We will only publish job roles and orgs after we collect at least 1,000 signatures. We understand why you’re scared because we are too. We have written and signed this letter not only because we are deeply worried about senior leadership driving us into a dark future but also because we see an opportunity for our actions to ripple beyond just our company. We ourselves have been looking for inspiration, trying to find everyday people fighting to resist authoritarianism and all its insidious arms, and we realized that we can’t just rely on others to inspire or save us. We have to do our part too. Signing is a decision only you can make. Thank you for deeply considering. Why should I sign? Why does this matter? We wrote this letter because we feel a deep pit in our stomachs working at this company, knowing that our leadership is actively supporting the Trump administration and exploiting workers and the planet along the way. The AI transition, the climate crisis, and descent into authoritarianism are happening right now; Jassy and Bezos have already made it clear what they’re doing about it. We have a narrow window to demand a different path before it’s too late, and those demands will only be heard if as many of us as possible sign on and speak up together. There is too much at stake. Will this letter be released publicly? Will my name be shared publicly? After we hit at least 1,000 signatures from Amazon employees, we will publicly list all the roles and orgs of everyone who signed. We will NOT publish names. This letter will be fully public once it's released Amazon is a big company with a lot of power! What do we think this letter will do and why? We want to catalyze change, and we think amassing a number of signatures to a well-researched and well-publicized letter will do that in a few ways. It will add a much-needed dose of reality to the larger Al conversation. Right now, it seems like everyone is talking about AI, but the points in this letter are not being talked about enough. We can change that. The tide is already turning, and we’re at an inflection point; the MIT study about 95% of corporate purchases of AI failing to increase profits, and the possible deflation or even bursting of the AI bubble. It’s the right moment to start a more serious, balanced conversation. If enough employees sign and this letter enters public awareness, that may force Amazon leadership to respond in some way to our demands. We want tech workers to know that they have a voice and a stake in how AI development plays out, and that their perspectives are crucial in the fight for the future. We think the letter will encourage more conversations among tech workers at Amazon and beyond. Isn’t AI inevitable? What are some examples of workers being able to push back? SEIU in Pennsylvania established a workers council on AI. AAUP in Miami established an AI Task Force and sent out a survey asking faculty members and librarians how AI affects teaching and research—showing that AI is an issue that affects their working conditions. National Nurses United created a bill of rights regarding the use of AI in healthcare, including rights to person-to-person care and for developers to demonstrate that AI tools are safe before being used to help with patient care. And NNU has had some early victories — at USC hospitals and Kaiser Permanente — they’ve won assurances that AI won’t replace human nurses and for workers to form an oversight committee on how AI is getting used in hospitals. Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, through sustained striking and contract negotiations, won new contracts that included some protections against GenAI being used without their consent or compensation, and more worker agency in determining how they use GenAI on the job.

Title: More Than 1 Million Jobs Have Been Cut This Year, Report Says

ByMary Whitfill Roeloffs, Forbes Staff. American companies have cut more than 1 million jobs so far this year, a new report showed Thursday, ranking 2025 among the worst years for job losses in decades as companies embrace artificial intelligence, consumer spending softens and hiring freezes take effect. Private and public employers cut 153,074 jobs in October, according to a report from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a 183% increase from the month before and a 175% spike over the same month last year. More than 1 million jobs have been cut so far this year, up 65% from the 664,839 announced in the first 10 months of 2024 and 44% more than cuts made in all of 2024. The government, responsible for more than 300,000 job losses, remains the sector with the most cuts this year, followed by the technology, warehousing, retail and service sectors. Job cuts have surpassed 1 million in a year only four other times in the last 32 years: 2001 (when the dot-com bubble burst), 2008 and 2009 (in the midst of the Great Recession) and 2020 (when the COVID pandemic struck). Andrew Challenger, chief revenue officer and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, blamed the adoption of artificial intelligence, federal budget cuts, lower customer and corporate spending and rising costs for the job cuts announced in October. Last month brought the highest number of job cuts for any October since 2003, when large layoffs were announced in the telecommunications sector as cell phones gained wide adoption. "Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape," Challenger said.

The philanthropist dropped upward of $300 million on historically Black colleges and universities this fall. Campus leaders are overjoyed and spending in ways they never thought possible. By Sara Weissman You have /5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. Historically Black colleges and universities are celebrating another round of donations from MacKenzie Scott. Photo illustration by Justin Morrison/Inside Higher Ed | Raymond Boyd and picture alliance/Getty Images | Katherine Frey and Michael A. McCoy/The Washington Post/Getty Images | sshepard/iStock/Getty Images Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott showered historically Black colleges and universities with hundreds of millions of dollars this fall in another one of her signature giving sprees. HBCU leaders say the unrestricted lump sums are a godsend after decades of chronic underfunding—and they’re putting them to good use, padding previously meager endowments and funding a wide variety of technology advances, research ventures and scholarships. Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has repeatedly poured funds into often underresourced institutions, including HBCUs, as part of a 2019 pledge to give away half of her wealth in her lifetime. Her largess to colleges and nonprofits has come in waves since 2020. By 2023, her gifts to educational institutions and nonprofits exceeded $1 billion. At HBCUs, those funds led to new research centers, endowed chair positions and more aid for students, among other initiatives. Some institutions, like Bowie State University, saved and invested the money, benefiting them years down the line. Scott’s latest round of donations to HBCUs includes some whopping sums: $80 million to Howard University in Washington, D.C.; $38 million to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore; and $38 million each to Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University in Georgia. Scott gifted $50 million to Virginia State University, $42 million to Alcorn State University in Mississippi, $38 million to Alabama State University and $63 million to Morgan State University in Maryland, marking the largest individual gifts in their histories. The United Negro College Fund, an organization representing private HBCUs, also received $70 million from Scott toward its capital campaign to create a $370 million pooled endowment for 37 institutions. The sum, announced last month, will be distributed among HBCUs in the pool. Notoriously private, Scott has spoken little about why HBCUs have loomed so large in her philanthropic portfolio. But in a 2021 blog post, she called higher ed “a proven pathway to opportunity” and said she sought to bolster institutions “successfully educating students who come from communities that have been chronically underserved.” She also had close ties to Howard alumna and author Toni Morrison, who served as Scott’s thesis adviser at Princeton University. Scott cited everyday “acts of kindness” as her inspiration for her recent gifts in a post last month. “When my next cycle of gifts is posted to my database online, the dollar total will likely be reported in the news,” she wrote, upward of $300 million to HBCUs alone, “but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into the world this year.” HBCU leaders say that “tiny fraction” has gone far for their institutions. Scott “really understands the value that these institutions have historically made to the overall competitiveness of our country,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan State University. She’s “making transformational investments in these institutions that will enable them to continue to provide in perpetuity opportunities for students to taste the magic of a college degree that will enable them to live productive and prosperous lives.” Brent Swinton, vice president for philanthropic engagement at Bowie State University, which received a $25 million gift from Scott in fiscal year 2021, emphasized how rare unrestricted grants are for any institution, let alone HBCUs. “Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry,” he said. Scott is “single-handedly saying to HBCUs, ‘Here is an investment for those who already are getting it right but just haven’t had the same opportunities to be in the conversation with philanthropists.’” With fresh funds in hand—and the freedom to use the dollars how they choose—HBCU leaders are dreaming up new plans. Morgan State University put $60 million into its unrestricted endowment. Wilson expects that investment will generate an extra $4 million to $5 million per year for the university and its students going forward. Wilson also set aside $1 million to immediately support its most cash-strapped students. The institution reached out to 2,100 students with “severe financial need,” and already, 600 students have requested the funding to help them finish out the semester. The university has plans to create a new brain science research center as well, adding to the research centers it established with help from the last grant from Scott in 2020. Morgan State used part of that $40 million grant to win state appropriations for its National Center for the Elimination of Educational Disparities and its Center on Urban Health Equity. The university is filling those centers with “faculty members who will be churning out original research that’s coming from the perspective of researchers who really understand what some of those challenges are within our communities that are preventing the students from achieving their full potential,” Wilson said. He partly credits Scott’s gifts for Morgan State hovering on the precipice of R-1 status, the Carnegie Foundation classification for universities with very high research activity. Howard University received $80 million from Scott. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Howard University became the only HBCU to attain R-1 status earlier this year. Now, about $17 million of Scott’s donation to Howard is earmarked for its College of Medicine, to expand it and establish a new academic medical center. Howard also plans to invest in capital construction and renovation projects, including new residence halls, and to create a reserve in response to the government shutdown. Interim Howard University president Wayne A. I. Frederick said students are affected by delays in federal food benefits and layoffs and furloughs of federal employees in their families. Federal appropriations to Howard have been waylaid, as well. “We want to give students some temporary relief,” Frederick said. Spelman College’s interim president, Rosalind Brewer, emphasized that these gifts come at a time of “quite a bit of uncertainty in higher ed” as federal policy changes roil institutions. She said the $38 million to Spelman offers her flexibility in how to respond. Unrestricted gifts are the unicorn, the white whale of the fundraising industry.” For example, Spelman plans to put some of the funding toward new scholarships, particularly for juniors and seniors who rely on Parent PLUS loans, which will be capped starting next year due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The goal is to close financial gaps for juniors and seniors who may struggle to pay to finish their degrees. Spelman also spent a previous gift from Scott, $20 million given in 2020, on student scholarships, as well as its endowment. “Some days, we don’t know what we’re going to face the next day,” Brewer said. The donation “gives us the confidence that, come what may the next morning, we just may be a little bit more prepared.” The gift to Spelman will also support an effort to improve classroom technology, including new tools to teach artificial intelligence skills to students. The college came out with a technology road map last month that it’s eager to get started on with the new support. An unrestricted gift “allows us to look at our strategic plan and apply it to where we know the money will work best for us,” Brewer said. “That makes this donation, quite honestly, a lot more generous than most people would realize.” HBCUs that received funds from Scott in years past say the gifts are still paying dividends. Bowie State University invested $22.5 million of its $25 million gift into its endowment. At the time, the endowment stood around $8 million. Four years later, it’s surpassed $49 million, buttressed both by Scott’s giving and other philanthropic donations that followed her “vote of confidence,” Swinton said. He noted building up endowments has been a longtime goal for many HBCUs but hard to achieve. “Endowments are not sexy, but they are lifeblood and the nest egg for an institution,” he said. “If you took all 103 HBCU endowments and added them up today, they still wouldn’t come close to any of the top 10 endowments of [predominantly white institutions].” Bowie State took the $2.5 million left over and used it to apply for matching grants from other philanthropies that it wouldn’t have had the funds to qualify for in the past. One of those partnerships enabled Bowie State to create its first endowed chair position in cybersecurity and innovation. “We look to do more of that, to be able to establish positions that will build our infrastructure, that now have a source of permanent funding, instead of being completely reliant on whatever the state budget allows” as a public HBCU, Swinton said. Frederick, of Howard University, said he also feels a lasting impact from Scott’s past gifts in 2020 and 2023, $40 million and $12 million, respectively. Those funds enabled Howard to set up the Toni Morrison Endowed Chair in Arts and Humanities and to spread the wealth, creating a $500,000 scholarship for graduates of the University of District of Columbia, a local HBCU that didn’t get Scott funds, to attend Howard’s graduate and professional programs. Howard also increased its emergency aid funding for students. Scott is “doing things so differently,” Frederick said. “It provides us with a lot of freedom to do what we need to do.” (Article was corrected to reflect UNCF's plans for a $370 million pooled endowment.)

Title: Laptop Class on Notice

Amazon was busy this week, sending out pink slips. When it’s all said and done, this massive round of layoffs could hit up to 30,000 employees. This amounts to about 10 percent of the entire corporate workforce. The reduction in force (RIF) is expected to spread across several departments, including Human Resources, Cloud Computing (AWS), and Advertising. Moreover, this is Amazon’s largest RIF since 2022, which eliminated around 27,000 jobs. The massive layoffs have several aims. First, to address the remaining excess of the pandemic hiring spree, when online shopping boomed and Amazon doubled its warehouse network. Second, CEO Andy Jassy says he wants to use Artificial Intelligence to “do more with less.” In other words, these layoffs aren’t merely a reaction to typical economic headwinds – things like high prices or a slower market. Rather, they’re part of a structural shift for big corporations and will have permanent consequences for business, labor, and the economy. For example, massive layoffs like this at a company as enormous as Amazon are a signal that big businesses are tightening their belts. They’re looking for ways to cut expenses without hurting growth. At the same time, as tens of thousands of corporate jobs disappear, consumers will be compelled to reduce their spending. Amazon still has a market capitalization of over $2.3 trillion. These layoffs show that even the mega companies are working to conserve cash and increase efficiency by cutting jobs and replacing workers with AI. Specifically, the current strategy is to achieve growth without hiring. Amazon is not alone in this “do more with less” strategy. In fact, RTX Corporation, an aerospace and defense company, recently noted that its sales rose without adding employees. Goldman Sachs recently sent a memo to staff stating they would “constrain head count growth” to get more efficient with AI. Even Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, plans to keep its head count flat for the next three years while growing sales. Same story with UPS. The package delivery company announced this week it’s slashing a massive 48,000 jobs – 34,000 from operations and 14,000 from management – in a major effort to cut costs. This huge workforce reduction, which helped UPS beat Q3 profit expectations, is part of a plan to save $3.5 billion in 2025. A big driver for the layoffs is a massive push towards automation and AI to make operations more efficient and less labor dependent. Here’s UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes on the features and benefits of AI and automation: “You need less variable capacity, fewer leased aircraft, fewer rented vehicles, fewer seasonal workers. That allows you to run a much more efficient network.” JPMorgan Chase’s CFO Jeremy Barnum recently told investors that the bank now has a “very strong bias against having the reflective response” to hire more people. The first thought is no longer ‘hire,’ but ‘automate.’ Earlier in October, white-collar workers from Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips, or learned that they would come soon. The latest wave of generative AI is proving it can efficiently handle tasks in coding, marketing, customer support, and more. Thus, companies are using AI to staff fewer jobs. While AI is augmenting some roles, its primary corporate function right now is a swift reduction in payroll… One of the key takeaways from Amazon’s layoffs is that the increased use of AI is not just for assisting, but for replacing. The layoffs are a direct result of Amazon’s massive investment in AI, which is now explicitly framed as a job eliminator. In this regard, Amazon CEO Jassy already told employees that the increased use of generative AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” in the next few years, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change.” Jassy is putting his money where his mouth is. For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, with most of that dedicated to AI and cloud-computing investments. Yesterday (October 30), following market close, Amazon released its third quarter 2025 earnings results. Of note, AWS segment sales increased 20 percent year-over-year to $33 billion. Amazon has also been automating its warehouses using Blue Jay, an impressive system of robotic arms combined with AI systems, which will significantly reduce the need for warehouse laborers. Per the announcement from Amazon: “Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball—only here, the “balls” are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed. It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.” Blue Jay also doesn’t call in sick, take lunch breaks and vacation days, or require the company to contribute to an employee 401(k) match. This is but one example of the endless types of automated, worker replacement, AI applications that are being rolled out. Blue collar and white-collar workers alike should be worried. AI is coming for their jobs. But what choice do companies have. Now that the AI cat is out of the bag, its implementation and use are required to compete. Amazon’s value is now fundamentally tied to its AI aptitude. After reporting slower cloud growth than competitors earlier this year, its shares fell 7 percent. But this proved to just be a slight setback. As part of yesterday’s Q3 report, Amazon “added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months – more than any other cloud provider.” This sent the after-hours share price skyrocketing by over 13 percent the last we saw. Simply put, AI has moved from a shiny new tool to a serious factor when executives are making headcount decisions. The future is looking lean, and it’s being powered by algorithms! Amazon CEO Jassy’s aggressive push into generative AI means a slimmer corporate workforce is on the horizon. This is an all-encompassing push to replace human tasks with tools like AI agents built on services such as Amazon Bedrock. The impact is already being felt across Amazon’s white-collar departments. In Tech and AWS, the goal is to massively speed up development. AI is being deployed to write code, summarize information, and tackle research. The Bedrock platform itself allows developers to create powerful AI agents that execute complex workflows, essentially automating traditional software roles. In the process, white-collar jobs are eliminated. Human Resources – everyone’s least favorite department – is also a prime target. Layoffs have already hit the department as Amazon seeks to automate administrative work. Generative AI is now handling automated resume screening and shortlisting. AI-powered assistants are taking over common employee queries and training support, cutting the need for human administrators. AI is also taking over Advertising and Content creation. It can instantly write new marketing copy, draft social media posts, and create realistic images for campaigns. This transition proves that AI is rapidly automating the “laptop class” jobs that were once considered safe. When the industrial revolution took root, workers moved from the farm to the factory. When factory jobs were offshored over the last 40 years, the next generation of workers moved to the office. Now, with the burgeoning AI revolution taking over both factory and office jobs, where will these workers go? Is there room for them all on the government dole? Can AI somehow turn unemployment into funemployment? Certainly, as AI automates routine work, it will also create an entirely new set of jobs. Prompt Engineers, for instance, are needed to effectively communicate with AI. There’s also the need for AI Trainers to perfect the models. Perhaps a whole suite of new jobs will soon appear to fulfill the promise of AI. Yet for workers who received pink slips this week, those jobs better come soon.

Title: Anxious about AI job cuts? How white-collar workers can protect themselves - starting now

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. What's been a hard 12 months for professionals just got tougher. Fears over the increased use of AI to complete white-collar roles have been compounded by news of layoffs. If you're a mid-level professional, it's tough not to feel anxious about the future of work. In a memo to staff last week, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said her company's decision to cut 14,000 corporate roles was aimed at "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources." Also: AI struggles to cite results properly. Can Perplexity and Getty's new partnership fix that? The news from Amazon is the latest in a series of layoffs by big businesses. Experts believe one significant factor affecting the fast-changing job market is AI. Earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could be responsible for eliminating half of all entry-level white-collar jobs -- while spiking unemployment to 10-20% -- in the next one to five years. However, while AI is fundamentally altering the nature of white-collar work, professionals can take steps now to reduce their anxiety and prepare for the future. First, said Bev White, executive chair at technology and talent solutions provider Nash Squared, professionals must be honest. Examine your role and make a genuine assessment of how at risk it is from AI, now or in the future. "Think about what transferable skills you have, the core human skills that machines can't replace, and where they can be applied," she told ZDNET, suggesting professionals should research the market, network with contacts, and look for opportunities. "Work hard on how you present yourself and communicate your core strengths, to make yourself highly visible both within your own organization and to others." Also: A minority of businesses have won big with AI. What are they doing right? That approach resonates with James Carney, associate professor at the London Interdisciplinary School, who told ZDNET that we're entering an era where neither technical training nor AI competency will guarantee employability. "Instead, the differentiator will be how well people can use AI thoughtfully and how they apply their own judgment, creativity, and ethics alongside the technology," he said. Education will be a crucial component for professionals who want to future-proof their skills. To that end, Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight, told ZDNET that professionals should retrain, reskill, and rescope their roles. "Think of AI like online banking when it arrived -- you learned the basics because it became the default," she said. "Do the same here by getting comfortable with writing clear prompts, checking outputs, and documenting what you did. That's the new baseline." Also: 4 ways to turn AI into your business advantage Rotibi also encouraged professionals to learn about data ground rules, such as where models fail, and guardrails, including the General Data Protection Regulation, audit trails, and sector policies. Finally, Rotibi suggested a principle for the digital age is that AI training should be a right, not a perk. If employers want to achieve generative AI assistant-level productivity, they should invest in access, time, and clear guardrails. "Workers should feel entitled to ask for and expect accredited courses, safe sandboxes, and clear policies, backed by government and education providers," she said. Amazon's job cuts could be indicative of several larger trends that professionals should be aware of. Rotibi said the cuts represent a shift in the work that the company considers important. AI is speeding things up, so Amazon wants fewer people coordinating and more people building technology, which explains why some office roles are affected. AI is both the tool that reduces some jobs and the magnet that pulls money and new roles into chips, power, and platforms. Also: Adobe might've just solved one of generative AI's biggest legal risks She also stressed that Amazon's cuts are part of a broader IT industry trend, with companies such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce reshaping teams, trimming middle layers, and redirecting spend toward AI platforms and data centers. Other professionals outside IT are also subject to cuts. In its analysis of Amazon's job cuts, "The Wall Street Journal" pointed to UPS reporting last week that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. "White-collar work is being reshaped, not erased," Rotibi noted. "The center of gravity is shifting from coordination to designing, integrating, and governing automated systems with fewer hand-offs and more ownership of outcomes." For professionals who will be anxious about these workplace changes, it's important to recognize that AI isn't the only explanation for the reshaping of white-collar work As Karim Morgan Nehdi, CEO at consulting and training specialist Herrmann International, suggested to ZDNET, the IT layoffs should be seen in the context of broader macroeconomic challenges. "They're about AI arriving at exactly the wrong economic moment," he said, with some of the challenges including over-hiring during the pandemic, weakening economies and tariffs, and continued geopolitical instability. "Companies facing higher costs and investor pressure needed a compelling efficiency narrative, and AI handed them one on a silver platter." However, and most crucially for professional staff, Nehdi also recognized that these layoffs feel different -- and that divergence, whatever the explanation, is due to the potential longer-term impact of AI on professionals. Research by Herrmann, in collaboration with MyPerfectResume, compared ChatGPT's cognitive profile with that of 2.5 million professionals across 800 jobs. The analysis found that ChatGPT's thinking style closely aligned with professions that rely on decision-making under pressure. Also: Is AI making it harder for new college grads to get hired in tech? Professions most cognitively similar to ChatGPT include colonels, cardiologists, and -- crucially for many readers of this article -- IT managers, with each profession sharing an alignment of over 93% with the AI's analytical thinking profile. "Our research shows that AI's cognitive overlap is highest with work we once thought was safe from automation: analytical, structured tasks that have defined many white-collar roles," he said. The conclusion, added Nehdi, is simple: "The 'safe' white-collar jobs just became a lot less safe." For anxious IT professionals concerned about the ongoing influence of AI, that warning sounds a bit like a death knell for white-collar work. However, various experts told ZDNET that it's important to put fears over AI-enabled job losses into context. Also: No ROI in AI yet? Try these six proven tactics for creating real business value First, said Nehdi, emerging technology has uneven superpowers. While AI can write code effectively, it struggles with interpersonal and visionary tasks, such as empathy, creative improvisation, and reading the room, which are capabilities that define human advantage. He said those flaws are good news for white-collar workers: "This means there's no clean 'AI replaces X profession' story. It's messier and more interesting than that. Second, and adding further complexity to the trend alluded to above, Richard Corbridge, CIO at property specialist Segro, told ZDNET that, while the march toward AI offering efficiency in some roles is valid, the pathway toward how this impact will play out is unclear. And while the recent job cuts will raise anxieties among white-collar workers, Corbridge said AI could have a positive impact on workplace roles in the longer term, as younger professionals adapt and adopt the capabilities that will define future success. Also: Are you part of 'the great stay'? Here's what experts say is behind this latest job trend For professionals, therefore, the key is to embrace change. As Nash Squared's White concluded, there is no doubt that AI will impact some white-collar jobs, but that doesn't mean there is nothing you can do about it. "Be a pathfinder, not a victim," she said. "It is on all of us to keep ourselves relevant and current. It's something I always advocate for. Set aside time to invest in yourself. Your future self will thank you for it."

Title: Why are U.S. layoffs rising even as corporate profits surge?

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 6, 2025 / 8:13 AM EST / CBS News As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year — the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy. The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a "jobless boom." Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs. "This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook," Zhao told CBS News. "It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well." At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted. "You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine — profits are doing great," he said. "We've never seen anything like that." For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire," meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers. The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP. By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring. "Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. "While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP." The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available. Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said. "You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too," he said. "So that creates a very odd equilibrium." Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies. Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword. "These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up — it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs," he noted. But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said. "People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'" he said. "I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'." Edited by Alain Sherter © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. How many jobs are being lost to AI? A new bipartisan bill would require US companies to report AI-related job losses to the federal government to track the technology’s impact on employment. On Wednesday, Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act, which "will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce—what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging," Sen. Warner said in a statement. "Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind." Although researchers have already floated estimates about jobs lost to AI adoption, the senators say it's vital to start tracking the issue with concrete data. The bill proposes requiring both public and private companies in the US, as well as government agencies, to report AI-related job losses on a quarterly basis to the Department of Labor. This would cover jobs lost to automation and the use of artificial intelligence to replace human labor. Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals.

IBM is set to cut thousands of jobs in November and December as part of a workforce rebalancing strategy aimed at repositioning the company in the era of AI. The cuts come just months after the company claimed it is “focused on American jobs” with plans to invest in manufacturing. The Wall Street Journal reports that IBM has announced that it will lay off a small percentage of its global workforce before the end of the year. The tech giant, which employed around 270,000 people worldwide at the end of 2024, did not provide an exact figure for the number of employees affected by the cuts. Even a one percent reduction in staff would impact almost 3,000 white-collar professionals. An IBM spokesman stated, “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need. We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” IBM joins a growing list of companies, including Amazon, UPS, and Target, that have recently announced significant layoffs. These cuts are largely driven by a shift in corporate strategy towards embracing AI tools and emphasizing efficiency among employees. As AI continues to advance, many companies are investing heavily in building out the necessary infrastructure, such as data centers, to support these technologies. The layoffs at IBM come at a time when the company is striving to establish itself as a leader in the development of quantum computing. In competition with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as numerous startups, IBM is working on larger clusters of quantum chips that it believes will enable large-scale computing within the next five years. Breitbart News previously reported that IBM claimed to be “focused on American jobs and manufacturing” when it announced a $150 billion investment over the next five years: IBM revealed in a Monday press release that it “plans to invest $150 billion in America over the next five years to fuel the economy and to accelerate its role as the global leader in computing.” “This includes an investment of more than $30 billion in research and development to advance and continue IBM’s American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers,” the company said. IBM CEO and Chairman Arvind Krishna added, “Technology doesn’t just build the future — it defines it.” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently shared that the company has already used AI agents to replace the work of several hundred human resources employees. This move has allowed the company to redirect resources towards hiring more programmers and salespeople, highlighting the potential of AI to streamline certain business processes and enable strategic workforce allocation.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Layoffs are sweeping the corporate world as companies restructure around AI and automation. From Amazon to Target, major employers are slashing thousands of jobs as they race to restructure around automation and efficiency. On Tuesday, IBM became the latest company to announce it would cut thousands of workers by the end of the year as it shifts focus to high-growth software and AI areas. And for Gen Z the news might hit especially hard. Just last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna had positioned himself as a rare optimist amid widespread job cuts, pledging that his company would increase hiring among recent college graduates. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that.” Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but maintained that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” An IBM spokesperson told Fortune that the latest round of layoffs would impact a “low single-digit percentage” of the company’s global workforce. And, when combined with new hiring, it would leave the company’s U.S. headcount roughly flat. IBM did not specify how many workers would be affected or which departments would be hit. The company employed about 270,000 people at the end of 2024, meaning even a 1% cut in the workforce could affect some 2,700 workers. “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need,” the spokesperson added. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” Although it’s unclear which teams—or generations—will feel the blunt effects of the cuts, entry-level roles have borne some of the biggest impact from AI so far. Researchers at Harvard University found that junior employment has declined sharply at firms adopting AI. For professionals—whether they’re trying to break into the job market or rebound from a layoff—finding a job can feel like an uphill battle. After all, job postings have been on a gradual decline since their peak in March 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Krishna’s advice? Focus on developing the right skills for the AI age. “Skills of people are really important,” he told CNN. “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.” Hiring experts echo that view, saying that firms across industries are looking for candidates with AI experience—especially those familiar with the tools already in use internally. “Companies would rather hire a candidate who has hands-on experience with a particular tool they are implementing if they have the ability and interest to train up on other skills,” Alyssa Cook, a senior managing consultant at hiring and staffing firm Beacon Hill, previously told Fortune. A report released by Microsoft and LinkedIn last year found that 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills, as compared to a more experienced one without them. But even beyond technical know-how, experts say the right mindset can make the biggest difference. “We’re not just looking for people who know the tools,” Alejandro Castellano, CEO of automation firm Caddi, previously told Fortune. “We’re looking for those who are curious, adaptable, and thoughtful about how they use AI. That mindset makes the biggest difference.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: What Amazon’s Corporate Layoffs Signal for IT Leaders

Getty Images/iStockphoto On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced 14,000 corporate job cuts marking the company's largest single-announcement layoff at the time. Unlike previous cuts framed around economic uncertainty, this corporate workforce restructuring was largely tied to AI-related transformation. The October Amazon layoffs span business units including AWS, Devices, Prime Video, advertising, logistics and HR. This follows broader tech industry AI focused restructuring, as companies like Salesforce and Microsoft are also among the big names reducing headcount in 2025. For IT leaders, the layoffs are a cause for concern as the impact of AI begins to manifest on the future of work and what it all means for digital transformation strategy. Amazon framed the layoffs around reducing bureaucracy, flattening organizational layers and shifting resources to AI infrastructure investments. Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti wrote in a statement that this generation of AI is "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and emphasized that the company needs to be organized more leanly with fewer layers. CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in a June 2025 memo that the company would need fewer people doing some jobs as AI capabilities expanded. The connection between AI productivity and these job cuts is tenuous at best according to analysts. Amazon's job cuts are absolutely not a leading indicator and any C-suite that treats it as one is making a serious strategic misreading, according to Nate Suda, senior director analyst at Gartner. "Amazon’s actions are not representative of a widespread AI-driven productivity gain," Suda said. "The data is unequivocal: nearly four in five layoffs in the first half of 2025 were entirely unrelated to AI, and less than 1% were a direct result of AI productivity." Amazon's move is what Gartner calls a strategic "talent remix." The company is repositioning full-time employees, not eliminating them because AI made their roles obsolete. "These layoffs are a strategic reallocation of human capital to cut costs in some areas to fund high-priority, capital-intensive AI and cloud-computing investments," Suda said. The goal is to free up resources to build and sell AI services, he explained. Dave Nicholson, chief advisor at Futurum, agreed with this interpretation. "Very few of these job cuts can be attributed directly to efficiencies gained by the use of artificial intelligence," Nicholson said. "This is a preemptive effort to reorganize in support of their efforts to deliver AI services to industry." Chris Campbell, CIO at DeVry University, has watched budgets move from generalist corporate roles toward data, automation and platform engineering. However, CIOs should interpret Amazon's corporate layoffs as a signal to recompose rather than one to cut. "The future IT organization will be smaller, sharper and more specialized, with teams that know how to work alongside AI rather than compete with it, " Campbell said. There are numerous implications that Amazon's corporate layoffs have for organizations' design, governance and risk. Governance implications. Removing management layers eliminates more than bureaucracy. When organizations flatten management layers in pursuit of organizational agility, they often focus on speed and efficiency while systematically underestimating governance and risk implications. AI changes no aspects of flattening organizations in a meaningful way when it comes to fundamental governance risks, according to Nicholson. When organizations demand more productivity from an individual, regardless of the tools that individual uses, they are at risk for over-subscription.Risk of over-lean structures. According to Suda, the single greatest AI-driven automation risk is what he calls "experience starvation." AI assistants empower senior staff to accomplish more tasks independently without needing junior staff, he said. While AI can augment this work, it cannot create the expertise of discernment that comes with experience. In effect, companies are automating the future leadership of their own organizations out of existence. Change management risk. The biggest mistake organizations risk making is cutting the experts who make automation work, according to Campbell. "When organizations lose subject-matter specialists who understand exceptions and edge cases, they end up automating broken processes," he said. Regulatory and compliance implications. For regulated industries, the implications are even more critical. Financial services, healthcare and other sectors with audit, security, privacy or oversight requirements cannot simply flatten structures without ensuring that accountability mechanisms remain intact. The question is not whether a leaner design is more efficient in theory, but whether it can maintain the institutional controls the risk profile demands Many organizations approach workforce planning in the AI era by asking which roles can be automated, which in turn can lead to workforce reductions. While intuitive, this question fundamentally oversimplifies the challenge. "The binary of automation versus people is a misframed trap that leads to failed initiatives," according to Suda. The strategic analysis must be at the process level, not the individual level. Task-level assessment methodologyIT leaders should focus on task automation rather than role automation, according to Mark Moccia, vice-president and research director at Forrester. He offered a practical framework for workforce assessment: Inventory tasks by automation suitability: First focus on tasks that are repeatable with low variability. Ones that require more human judgement and have more possible outcomes should be targeted last. Apply weighted criteria: Rank tasks by highest business benefit, lowest error risk and custom organizational priorities. Determine role implications: Only consider broad role changes after task-level analysis. Futurum's Nicholson offers a practical decision framework: "Would I bet my job on the output from this AI tool?" If the answer is no, the task still requires human judgment, oversight or validation. This simple test exposes the gap between AI capability and AI reliability. Many tools can produce outputs that look plausible but contain subtle errors, omissions or hallucinations. Deploying these tools without human oversight creates risk. Maintaining oversight requires retaining human expertise. Identifying AI roles for workforce planning Gartner's Suda has a sophisticated framework for workforce planning based on three distinct patterns organizations create with AI: Experience starvation: AI empowers senior experts to work independently, reducing mentorship opportunities. The strategy here is more on hiring avoidance rather than headcount reduction. Experience compression: AI upskills junior staff in low-to-mid complexity roles. This is the only pattern that can lead to the "reduce headcount" strategy. But this is proving highly elusive as Gartner sees it successfully done in fewer than 1% of cases. Experience redistribution: Pivoting to AI-centric business models, as Amazon demonstrates. The strategy here is to capture new markets rather than improving productivity. Reskilling and redeployment strategy For organizations pursuing workforce changes, reskilling becomes critical, according to Campbell. Organizations should emphasize internal mobility, retraining and retention of institutional memory. "Fix the process before you automate it," he said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability: data quality, training, governance, so the gains actually stick." Reskilling efforts are lagging, Nicholson said. "The go-to answer seems to be to cut staff, see what happens, then patch the holes where necessary with AI-skilled labor," he said. "This reactive approach creates precisely the disruption and knowledge loss organizations can least afford." Budgeting for upskilling Investment in people skills must parallel investment in AI technology, according to Campbell. Roughly a third of an organization's AI program budget should go to people through upskilling, reskilling, change management and new hybrid roles like automation engineers and data translators. "When that share falls too low, adoption and governance tend to suffer," he said. Amazon's workforce restructuring is occurring alongside massive capital investments in computing infrastructure, data centers and AI capabilities. This apparent contradiction -- cutting corporate headcount while increasing technology spending -- reveals the fundamental economics of AI transformation. CapEx and OpEx trade-offs The shift from operational expenditure on people to capital expenditure on infrastructure changes cost structures fundamentally. Building computing, storage and network capabilities for enterprise AI requires substantial upfront investment. Traditional IT cost optimization assumes quick labor savings, but AI transformation may take years to materialize, if it materializes at all The key question is whether the organizations can quantitatively tie investments to business value achieved, Moccia said. "Is that the right use case that will bring the most value?" he said. "If not, focus investments elsewhere." Legacy architecture and modernization Organizations with decades of accumulated systems face stark choices. They can continue supporting legacy infrastructure with existing headcount, invest in modernization to enable AI and automation or attempt a hybrid approach that creates complexity and integration challenges. The Amazon corporate layoffs context suggests the company is betting on modern, AI-centric architecture over maintaining legacy systems. For most enterprises, the calculation differs. Legacy systems often contain decades of business logic that would be expensive and risky to rebuild. Operational risk and resilience Infrastructure must scale in tandem with organizational capability to manage it. When infrastructure scales faster than headcount, operational risk increases. CIOs must model scenarios where infrastructure demands grow faster than automation delivers labor savings. The gap creates pressure on remaining staff, which can lead to burnout, knowledge loss through attrition and reduced capacity to handle exceptions. Monitoring and observability become more critical as organizations become leaner. Automated systems must provide visibility into operations that previously relied on human monitoring. When issues arise, remaining staff need sophisticated tools to diagnose and remediate quickly. Budget planning: From staffing to infrastructure The strategic framework should start with business value and work backward to resource allocation. Starting with headcount reduction targets and hoping value follows inverts the logic. Amazon's infrastructure investments make strategic sense because the company builds products to sell. For most enterprises, the calculus differs. Infrastructure must enable better business outcomes, not simply replicate existing outcomes with different cost structures. "Fix the process before you automate it," Campbell said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability—data quality, training, governance—so the gains actually stick." Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mike Kostersitz spent 31 years building a career at Microsoft. Then, at age 60, he had to do something he hadn't done in decades: Find a job. In May, Kostersitz, a principal product manager lead working on Azure, said his team had a meeting with a senior leader that seemed to go well. But the following morning, he noticed a high-priority meeting had been added to his calendar — and it didn't bring good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said Kostersitz, who lives in Washington state. His manager and two of his direct reports were also affected, along with about 6,000 others. Kostersitz said the layoff came as a total surprise, so he took the rest of the week to process it before beginning his job search. Over the last five months, he's landed interviews with a handful of companies, including Nvidia and Nike. He said there's one opportunity he's optimistic about, but that he still hasn't secured a job. Kostersitz is among thousands of Microsoft workers who've been laid off over the past year. A company spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Microsoft isn't the only large tech company laying off workers. Amazon, Meta, and Google have also cut jobs. While overall layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a hiring slowdown across the industry has made it more challenging for many to secure new roles. In a challenging environment, some workers are considering options outside Big Tech — whether taking a role at a smaller company, starting a business, or retiring early. Kostersitz shared how he approached his first job search in decades. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: In the days after his layoff, Kostersitz said his initial instinct wasn't to be angry with Microsoft. He'd spent more than half his life at the company and had built many connections there. However, he wished the news had been delivered more personally. "After 31 years, you would expect at least your manager or your VP or somebody to come to you and say, 'Hey Mike, this is going to happen and here is why.'" Still, Kostersitz said he was grateful for Microsoft's "55 and 15" policy, which allows long-tenured employees who are at least 55 years old and have spent at least 15 consecutive years at the company to have their stock grants continue vesting even after their employment ends. His Microsoft stock and savings gave him time to look for a new role, but he knew that cushion wouldn't last forever. Kostersitz said he and his wife can get by financially for about two years without tapping into their retirement accounts — thanks to savings, severance pay, and Microsoft stock. As he struggled to find work, Kostersitz said he began thinking about whether an early retirement could be an option. Now 60, he'd tentatively planned to retire around 67, though he was open to working longer. However, he concluded that retiring now would be financially challenging for him and his wife. "Technically, we could retire," he said. "Would it be a huge change of lifestyle? Absolutely." Given that he'd spent the prior three decades at Microsoft, Kostersitz initially felt like a fish out of water in the job market. Over the past two decades, he'd built teams — reviewing résumés, interviewing candidates, and making hiring decisions. But being on the other side of the table was unfamiliar. So his first step was to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn, draft cover letters, and optimize his materials for applicant tracking systems. In addition to hiring a private coach, Kostersitz said Microsoft provided a career advisor as part of its layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Kostersitz began applying for jobs, targeting director-level roles in product or program management. He applied to tech companies like Google and Apple, as well as to tech roles at non-tech firms like Nordstrom. He said he tried to secure referrals at some companies — and got one from a Nvidia employee that helped him land an interview — but said he struggled to get traction. Kostersitz said one challenge during interviews is figuring out which parts of his career to highlight. He said he frequently gets "tell me about a time when" questions, and while he has decades of experience, it's difficult to know which examples will resonate. "It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?" he said. Despite these obstacles, Kostersitz hasn't given up. He said the Microsoft-provided advisor encouraged him to stick with his current strategy — and emphasized that job hunting in today's market is, in some ways, a test of endurance. "They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Jump to

Title: Job hunting's newest rules — and whether they actually work

Karishma Mandal wanted to land an AI role at a big-name company, so she designed a job search strategy she hoped would help her stand out. Throughout her search, she'd grown confident in the merits of two tactics: being among the first to apply for roles and submitting applications directly through company websites, not job boards. "You have to be early, you have to go through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," said the 29-year-old. Mandal's strategies seemed to pay off. She landed interviews with Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and an offer from Salesforce, where she started full-time in January as an AI-focused product manager in San Francisco. Mandal is among the job seekers who've embraced a growing number of job search hacks that have gained traction. Over the past year, Business Insider has spoken with dozens of job seekers who've relied not only on conventional approaches, such as crafting strong résumés and securing referrals, but also on less-proven tactics. In a competitive hiring landscape, applicants are willing to try just about anything. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, companies are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013, largely due to tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption. In this environment, job seekers are throwing strategies at the wall and hoping they stick. Job applicants rarely know exactly why they were passed over for one role or landed an interview for another. As a result, it's just as hard to debunk some job search strategies as it is to prove they can actually work. Business Insider asked career experts from LinkedIn and Indeed to weigh in on the effectiveness of some of the most commonly cited strategies — and whether they're worth your time. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year. Share your story, whether you found a job or are still looking, by filling out a form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.

Read more on the topic: Mandal thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role to ensure hiring managers see her application. Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, said it's common for employers to review applications in the order they're submitted, and that some may stop reviewing candidates or close a posting after reaching a certain number of applicants. "I definitely think applying early can increase your visibility," she said. Catherine Fisher, a career expert at LinkedIn, said that applying to a job within 10 minutes of receiving a LinkedIn alert — notifications users can set up for specific types of roles — can increase a person's chances of hearing back by up to four times. She said some recruiters may be working under tight timelines and begin contacting qualified applicants as soon as they find them. Despite the benefits of applying early, both experts emphasized the importance of submitting a quality application — not just a quick one. After earning her master's degree and struggling to land a job, Preeti Ladwa applied to roles between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. every weekday. Her rationale: Recruiters would review recent applications first when they logged on in the morning. Ladwa believes this strategy helped her land a job as a technical projects manager. "I didn't want my résumé to get buried under hundreds of others," she said. Rathod said she's not aware of any data supporting the value of early-morning applications, but believes it's smart to apply during business hours. Some recruiters receive alerts when new applications arrive, she said, and if those come in during the workday — while they're actively reviewing candidates — they may be more likely to give them a closer look. By contrast, applications submitted after hours might get lost in a larger batch of overnight submissions. However, Fisher said she's skeptical that applying at a specific time of day makes much of a difference. She believes it's more important for job seekers to pick a consistent time to submit applications — one that helps them establish a routine and stay committed to the process. "I don't think there's a magic hour to apply," she said. When Ryan Hemenway began looking for a new field scientist job in 2023, he struggled to gain traction, so he decided to shift his approach. While he continued browsing job postings on ZipRecruiter and Indeed, he stopped applying through those platforms and instead submitted applications directly through company websites. He'd heard this might boost his chances of getting noticed, so he decided to give it a shot, in addition to his other search strategies. A few months later, he landed a new role. Rathod said she believes it's a common misconception that job seekers gain an edge by applying directly on a company's website. She said it's likely based on the belief that applications submitted through job platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed are placed in a separate "bucket" from those submitted directly — and that applications in this bucket are less likely to be prioritized. In reality, she said, many employers have integrated their hiring systems with job platforms, so applications typically end up in the same pipeline. "There's not going to be a distinction to the recruiter on whether you applied on the website or on a job platform," she said. She added that as long as a job seeker is applying through a reputable platform, the method of submission is unlikely to affect their chances. Mike Kostersitz, 60, has been job hunting since being laid off by Microsoft in May. In an effort to gain traction, he's worked with a career advisor that Microsoft provided as part of his layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Fisher said she generally doesn't think having extensive experience is a drawback for employers. However, she recommends focusing the bulk of an application on recent, relevant experience — and keeping descriptions of older roles brief, or potentially leaving them out if they don't directly strengthen the application. "It doesn't mean cutting off half of your career," she said. "I just think it means looking back at when your experience stops adding value." One of the most common strategies cited by job seekers is meticulously aligning their résumés and cover letters with keywords from the job description — often with the help of AI tools — in the hope of impressing applicant tracking systems (ATS), which are often the first to review applications. Both experts agreed this is a strategy worth investing in. "Matching your keywords to your résumé is really important," Rathod said. "An ATS is going to scan for those keywords, and if it sees them, you're more likely to move forward in the process." Fisher wouldn't advise applicants to embellish their résumés just to align with job postings, but she recommends taking the time to ensure they include all of their experiences that match the role. She said that some applicants may check more boxes than they initially realize. When they do check those boxes, she said, it's worth using the precise language from the job description to better align with what ATS are scanning for. "It's not about beating the system," she said. "You're just making sure that your skills and experience align with what the company is looking for." While many of the strategies discussed above may be worth investing in, Rathod said one of her top pieces of advice is not to overlook the importance of interview preparation. "People are probably putting a lot of effort into tailoring their résumés and getting those interviews, but the interview is when you really get to shine," she said. "Job seekers need to approach interviews with that same sense of preparation." Jump to

Title: 'Musk Will Get Richer, Millions To Lose Jobs': Nobel Laureate Warns Against AI Risks

Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist, has reiterated his concerns about the risks of massive job loss amid the rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). He also cautioned against the growth of AI companies and tech billionaires at the cost of millions of workers. Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI”, remarked that although some economists argue past technological shifts both eliminated and created employment, AI-driven technology may not follow the same path. He expressed his doubts over job creation while highlighting the potential risks of massive unemployment. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned during an interview with Bloomberg TV's Wall Street Week. “The reason it's bad is because of the way society's organised. So that Musk will get richer and a lot of people get unemployed and Musk won't care. I'm using Musk as a sort of stand-in. That's not on AI, that's on how we organise society,” he added. According to Bloomberg, the four major AI hyperscalers— Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon— are projected to raise their capital spending from $360 billion this year to $420 billion in the next fiscal year. “I believe that to make money you're going to have to replace human labour,” Hinton said. “My worry is that the obvious way to make money out of it, apart from charging fees to use the chatbots, is by replacing jobs. The way you make a company more profitable is to replace the workers with something cheaper. And I think that’s a big part of what’s driving it.” “Some economists say these big changes always create new jobs. It’s not clear to me that this will,” he added. AI can do “tremendous good” in healthcare and education, Hinton said. On being questioned if he would rather have the development of AI halted altogether, he was noncommittal. “It's not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things. It’s a difficult decision, because it can do tremendous good in health care and education." Hinton’s observations come amid widespread job reductions in the tech sector, with Amazon recently revealing plans to cut at least 14,000 corporate positions. While many leading tech firms have refrained from explicitly attributing layoffs to AI, industry experts and executives are increasingly raising concerns over hiring freezes and workforce downsizing due to the adoption of AI-driven technology.

Title: IBM to layoff thousands of employees before end of year

Published Nov 04, 2025 at 05:41 PM EST Reporter, Consumer & Social Trends IBM announced Tuesday it would be laying off thousands of employees before the end of the year. The job losses will amount to a “low single-digit percentage” of the global workforce. For a 1 percent cut, that would mean the loss of 2,700 jobs. Many companies have implemented layoffs as a way to boost profits and increase efficiency as they head into new financial quarters. Meta, for instance, announced it plans to cut roughly 600 roles from its AI team as business priorities shift. While IBM had 270,000 global workers at the end of 2025, a single-digit percentage layoff would mean thousands of employees would no longer have jobs at the end of the year. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” a company spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.” Many tech companies have reduced their employee headcounts, focusing on artificial intelligence tools to boost productivity even with fewer workers. In October, Amazon announced layoffs for 14,000 corporate employees, and Meta will be letting 600 workers in its AI unit go. IBM previously reported a 10 percent jump in revenue from software last month, but the larger sector is facing uncertainty from several directions, experts say. “The current environment is filled with uncertainty, and many companies may feel like this is the perfect opportunity to get rid of what some believe to be pandemic bloat,” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek. “Many companies were forced to keep staff for longer than they had hoped and perhaps this would allow them to thin their workforce.” Newsweek reached out to IBM for comment via email. Matt Bruno, chief revenue officer at Laivly, told Newsweek: “For the past few years, the industry’s been focused on building large, experimental AI teams. Now the emphasis is shifting to precision and measurable impact. We’ve seen that same evolution on the business side, especially in contact centers, where companies are moving from pilots to embedding AI directly into workflows that help agents make better decisions and improve performance. It’s fascinating to see that same focus on outcomes now extending to the model makers themselves.” Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “While some will lay the blame on AI for these cuts, it’s difficult to say based on the initial announcement if that’s in fact the case. The workforce in the United States for IBM actually remains flat year-over-year despite the cuts. Still, this is the latest in a series of major corporate job reductions that will further stoke fears of how technological advancements are going to lead to more job losses.” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: “The tech industry is accelerating toward AI adoption, and with that comes a belief in new efficiencies that allow companies to do more with less. Some divisions are being downsized because they rely on older, outdated technologies that no longer fit the direction the industry is heading. Others are being restructured or folded into different parts of the company.” Business experts say workers should expect a continuing spree of layoff announcements as we near the end of the year. “As we move toward the end of the year, expect more layoff announcements,” Thompson said. “Year-end is traditionally when companies evaluate performance, tighten operations, and adjust forecasts for the year ahead.” © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC
