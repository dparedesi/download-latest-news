The fear is real. In meetings, Slack chats, and after-work drinks, one question is quietly eating away at millions of employees: Will AI take my job? In public, CEOs like to sound reassuring. They say generative AI will âenhance productivityâ or âstreamline operations.â But when you actually read what they’re telling their own employees, or what slips out in investor memos, the message is chilling: virtual workers are here, and theyâre not just assistants. Theyâre replacements. Letâs take a closer look at what some of the worldâs most powerful tech CEOs are saying. Not in hype videos, but in official internal messages, blog posts, and investor updates. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently published a company-wide message that sounds reasonable, until you actually read it. âAs we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today… We expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.â The key phrase? âNext few years.â Thatâs corporate speak for 2026 to 2028. Not ten years away. This is soon. Jassy is not talking about automating only simple or repetitive tasks. Heâs preparing employees for a reality where AI replaces entire job categories across the board, and where hiring slows or stops altogether for roles that machines can now do. In a memo posted to LinkedIn, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was even more blunt. âMost functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work… Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.â Translation: No more hiring unless your job is impossible for AI to do. The company is betting that most teams will soon need fewer humans. Shopify CEO Tobi LÃ¼tke shared a similar directive on X: âBefore asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI… What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?â LÃ¼tke is openly asking managers to reimagine teams as if AI agents are already integrated, and to justify why any humans are still necessary. https://t.co/6i6h3sKi3x — tobi lutke (@tobi) April 7, 2025 The message from these CEOs is clear: human employees are now the last resort. The new default is automation. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently stated that AI is already doing 50% of the work within his company, shortly before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. The CEO of Klarna, a major fintech company, was even more blunt, revealing that AI has already allowed the company to reduce its workforce by 40%. These arenât future scenarios. This is already happening. The reason for this sudden shift is the rapid evolution of AI technology. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explained in a recent podcast, the latest “reasoning models” have made a critical leap. In simple terms, these AI systems can now do more than just find information; they can “think” through complex, multi-step problems. Altman suggested these models can reason on par with someone holding a PhD, meaning they are now capable of performing the high level analytical tasks once reserved for highly educated humans. This capability is being actively harnessed. Three sources working at major AI labs told Gizmodo that they are training powerful models to perform real world tasks in nearly every “knowledge work” profession, including banking, financial analysis, insurance, law, and even journalism. These sources, who requested anonymity as their contracts prohibit them from speaking publicly, described how their work is used in side by side comparisons with AI models to refine the technology until it can produce professional grade output with minimal errors. Virtual employees are already doing our jobs; the current phase is simply about making them more perfect. The “next few years” Jassy spoke of may be closer to two years at most. Consider the tech industry’s recent layoff trends. In 2024, 551 tech companies laid off nearly 152,922 employees, according to data from Layoff.fyi. The pace has accelerated dramatically this year. In just the first six months of 2025, 151 tech companies have already laid off over 63,823 people. On average a tech company cut 277 workers in 2024. If that rate is maintained for the rest of the year, the average number of layoffs per tech company in 2025 would soar to 851, roughly three times the 2024 average. While there is no direct evidence linking all these layoffs to AI, the trend is happening during a period of record economic strength. The Nasdaq just closed at an all time high, and eight of the world’s ten largest companies are in the tech sector. Profitable, growing companies are shedding workers at an alarming rate, and the quiet implementation of AI is the most logical explanation. Tech CEOs wonât tell you outright that youâre being replaced. But the memos speak for themselves. AI is already here, and your company is likely building a roadmap to automate you out of your role. One internal pilot project at a time. One chatbot at a time. One hiring freeze at a time. If you want to understand whatâs next for the American workforce, donât listen to the marketing. Read the footnotes in the CEOâs blog. Because theyâre already telling you the truth.

Update font size. Reset Beleaguered Intel has started layoffs in California as part of a cost-cutting and restructuring plan led by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This follows Tan’s August announcement that job cuts were inevitable, targeting a 15% to 20% reduction in the company’s workforce. Anton Shilov for Tom’s Hardware: ‎ Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products… The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote over twelve years ago: [Intel’s decision to pass on Apple’s iPhone] has to be close to the top of the list of Biggest Business Mistakes in History. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You don't need to be a Silicon Valley engineer or have any technical background at all, to make ... More money with AI AI has become such a controversial topic. It's one of those things where you can look at it extremely positively, but extremely negatively at the same time. For example, just over a week ago, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that the effects of AI in the organization would lead to large-scale layoffs and workforce reductions across the Big Tech giant, as more AI tools are being implemented and integrated across their workflow and systems. While this certainly spells bad news for employees who feel stuck within these roles, on the flip side, if you’ve been a casualty of an AI-induced layoff, there is still hope, because you can actually make AI work for you, not against you. You can actually join the opposition, so to speak, and leverage your existing skills while upskilling in AI, to build an AI-powered business as a freelancer. What’s really interesting is that more employers are outsourcing their work to freelance contractors. With freelance hiring up by 260% in the past two years alone, there’s never been a better time to be laid off, because opportunities are ripe for you to start your own business and pivot your career. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to launch your own venture, this is it. You can get started today, upskill relatively quickly, and capitalize on the strong interest that organizations have with implementing AI. Use this to your advantage so that you can effectively create your own job, hire yourself, and get paid for it. You know what’s even better? The AI-powered freelance business ideas listed in this article are no-code. This means you don’t need to be a software developer, ML engineer, or have a computer science background for these to work. Each of these ideas has the potential to rake in $100,000 or more a year in client contracts, projects, and consulting work. Let’s get into the list: There are two ways of looking at AI consulting. One is where you go deep into the development aspect of implementing AI into organizations. This is where you’ll definitely need to have solid technical background. But the other way of looking at it is a no-code approach. Some no-code options and services you can deliver for AI consulting work include: How much it pays: AI consulting work can pay as much as $175,000 a project. Create a monthly swipe file or kit of resources that your target clients can use, which will help them solve a specific problem. Monthly subscriptions are an excellent business model because they ensure longer retention and help to future-proof your career and finances due to their consistency. Additionally, this business model is perfect because it provides passive income, and it has low overheads. Often, you can start for less than $50, using one or more AI tools and Canva. They also support you during feast-or-famine cycles when clients from other streams of income may be running dry, and they make it easier for you as a freelancer to accurately predict and plan for your future financially, as well as making larger purchases. Some examples of AI-powered digital subscriptions you could offer include done-for-you marketing services, like: You can also combine some services to create higher-tier offers. For example, you could offer a YouTube content calendar, plus a strategy session, plus YouTube scripts. How much it pays: This business model provides unlimited income and can easily be scales and automated. Ask ChatGPT to draft a list of learning objectives and an outline for your niche corporate training program (the niche could be corporate wellbeing, sales, leadership training, etc.). Use it to brainstorm for the content and to develop the talking points of your presentation. Then, use AI tools like Prezi.ai or Canva’s AI features to help you develop the slide deck, and finally, ask ChatGPT to create survey questions relevant to your training, that you can give to attendees at the end of the session. How much it pays: Corporate trainers make about $87,000 a year, but on the higher end some are known to earn as much as $112,000 according to ZipRecruiter. That being said, if you provide digital products that can sell on their own, like ready-to-sell courses, you can make more money. Yes, you can build a business with AI. You just need to ensure that the following ingredients are in place: AI consulting is an extremely lucrative freelance business, with some projects paying upwards of ... More $150k Can I really make $100k a year using AI? Yes, AI has unlimited potential, and it’s only restricted by how and where you apply it. Once you spot a pain point, apply your expertise and use AI to back your solution so you can deliver it more efficiently and scale your income at the same time. Do I need to learn how to code to start an AI-powered business? No you don’t need coding knowledge. Business ideas like AI consulting focus on strategy and implementation advice.

Title: JCPenney Gifts $10,000 Dream Wedding to LA Couple Amid Brand Revival

While all eyes are on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ high-profile wedding in Venice, Italy this week, JCPenney hopes to divert attention to another Venice wedding that happened recently. On Wednesday, the department store funded a Los Angeles couple’s wedding in Venice, Calif. to prove that the big day doesn’t have to break the bank. The brand assisted high school sweethearts Estefany Gomez and Leonardo Rendon by outfitting the couple and their entire guest list, as well as providing all wedding decor—all for a total pricetag of $10,000. If you don’t believe them, check the receipt. “We’ve always dreamed of a California wedding, but with our families living on opposite coasts, it felt out of reach,” the couple said in a statement. “When JCPenney reached out, we honestly wondered if it could really happen. But they didn’t just say yes to our dream—they made every detail possible, from outfitting every guest in gorgeous fashion to the venue and cake, and most importantly, creating memories we’ll cherish forever.” Per Zola’s 2025 First Look Report, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is projected to hit $36,000, an increase from $33,000 in 2024 and $29,000 in 2023. The campaign comes as JCPenney attempts to stage a major comeback under its new chief marketing officer (CMO) Marisa Thalberg, following a period of bankruptcy, layoffs, store closures, and slow sales. Per Retail Dive, the brand’s Q4 total net sales decreased more than 9% to $2.09 billion. The publication also reported on Monday that the department store will shutter its Alliance Supply Chain facility in Haslet, Texas in November, impacting 300 employees. In April, JCPenney rolled out “Yes, JCPenney”, its first campaign under Thalberg, featuring unbranded billboards across NYC’s Times Square and in Brookfield and Simon malls nationwide. The posters showcased models wearing its clothes with no indication of where they came from. A QR code printed on the ads linked to JCPenney’s site. In the two months since the campaign’s release, JCPenney said it has seen a 22% increase in Google searches for the brand, as well as a rise in brand consideration from 13.6% to 16.4%. One of the lead outfits from the ad campaign also achieved an 88% sell-through. Thalberg, who joined in October 2024, said facilitating what she calls “the other Venice wedding” was a part of the brand’s strategy to reaffirm JCPenney as a destination for budget-conscious trendsetters. “As we think about what our place is in culture, it’s to gently poke at things that are elite and show how we can translate it for everyone else,” she told ADWEEK. The CMO added that consumers can anticipate more from its “Yes, JCPenney” campaign as it rolls out back-to-school fashion in the fall. Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .

Title: Salesforce chief Marc Benioff says AI now does up to half of all the work at his company
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/26/salesforce-chief-marc-benioff-says-ai-now-half-work-company/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T23:46:35Z

UPDATED 19:46 EDT / JUNE 26 2025 by Mike Wheatley Salesforce Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff says his company is doubling down on the use of artificial intelligence, using the technology to automate dozens of workloads that were, until recently, done by humans. In an interview with Bloomberg, Benioff (pictured) said AI agents are now performing as much as 30% to 50% of all the work at his company. “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher-value work,” Benioff said. The problem for some Salesforce employees is that they’ll need to find another employer who’s willing to pay them to perform that higher-value work. Earlier this year, the company announced it’s laying off about 1,000 of its staff. Although it has also announced plans to hire another 1,000, these new employees will be focused on selling its Agentforce technology. What that means is that those new workers will be tasked with urging other companies to adopt AI that can automate work normally done by humans, potentially encouraging them to replace some of their own employees. It’s a worrying trend that seems to be catching on. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a letter to employees where he discussed the company’s increased adoption of generative AI tools and admitted that it will likely need “fewer people” in future than it currently employs. The rise of AI comes at a time when technology companies are looking for new ways to try and cut costs and boost efficiencies, and many have already announced plans to achieve that by sacrificing human workers. For instance, Microsoft Corp. had already cut more than 6,000 jobs in May and is now reportedly undergoing a second round of layoffs while investing more in AI, according to Fast Company. Google LLC has also reportedly trimmed people from various departments. The website Layoffs.fyi says more than 63,000 jobs have disappeared in the tech industry so far this year, and there are growing reasons to think AI is at least partly responsible for this trend. In his latest newsletter, Brian Merchant, author of “Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech,” writes that he has spoken with dozens of tech industry workers who have been affected by the adoption of AI. He claims that the technology is rapidly reshaping Silicon Valley’s workforces. According to Merchant, an employee at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. told him that his company’s recent round of layoffs saw many new hires booted out and replaced with AI, despite saying publicly it was about cutting underperforming staff. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week,” the employee said. An employee at Dropbox Inc. made similar claims about his employer, saying that during its recent round of layoffs, the entire team focused on improving the reliability of its products was let go in favor of AI tools that can automate this work. Benioff told Bloomberg that the workforce is now undergoing a “digital labor revolution” and said his company’s AI agents can perform work with an accuracy of about 93%. “It’s pretty good, but it’s not realistic to hit 100%,” Benioff said, pointing out that other companies are at “much lower levels because they don’t have as much data and metadata.” Support our open free content by sharing and engaging with our content and community.

Title: Monster and CareerBuilder, once popular with job seekers, file for bankruptcy

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 3:14:47 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Monster and CareerBuilder, once two of the most popular websites for job seekers at the height of the dot-com era, have filed for bankruptcy. The two sites, which merged last year to become one entity named Monster + CareerBuilder, voluntary filed for Chapter 11 Tuesday, announcing that the company is selling various parts of its businesses to several buyers as part of a court-supervised process, a press release said. Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

Monster and CareerBuilder were some of the biggest companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the former brand so popular that it often bought Super Bowl commercials promoting its services. However, both have fallen out of favor for job hunters with the rise of competitors like Indeed, Glassdoor and Microsoft-owned LinkedIn in recent years. Jeff Furman, CEO of CareerBuilder + Monster, said in statement that its “business has been affected by a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment” and determined that “initiating this court-supervised sale process is the best path toward maximizing the value of our businesses and preserving jobs.” The most recognizable part of CareerBuilder and Monster — their job boards — is being sold to JobGet, a platform for gig and hourly workers searching for jobs. Monster Government Services, which provides software to state and federal governments, is being sold to Canadian-based Valsoft Corporation. Also, its media division — the two companies own Military.com and FastWeb.com — is being sold to Canadian media company Valnet. All purchases require court approval, with the sales subject to higher offers. Furman said the company is “making difficult but necessary decisions to reduce costs and help ensure a seamless transition of our businesses,” including layoffs. It has received $20 million in financing to keep operating during the bankruptcy process. (Excerpt) Read more at cnn.com ...

Title: Audacy Shuts Down Podcast Studio Pineapple Street, Lays Off Staff

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Radio broadcaster and podcast company Audacy is shuttering Pineapple Street Studios, which had produced original audio shows and companion podcasts for TV shows like “House of the Dragon,” “Severance” and “The Last of Us.” With the shutdown of Pineapple Street, nearly 30 employees are being laid off, according to sources familiar with the company. Audacy, previously known as Entercom Communications, had acquired Pineapple Street for a reported $18 million in 2019. Related Stories 'Brand New Landscape' Review: An Architect Has No Design for Family Life in a Quietly Affecting Japanese Drama An Audacy spokesperson said in a statement, “This difficult decision aligns our resources with our core strengths and the most promising growth areas for our podcasting business. We’re sorry to say goodbye to talented colleagues and are grateful for their contributions.” Popular on Variety Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management. In March, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions. Pineapple’s shows for TV networks included official podcasts for HBO and HBO Max series “And Just Like That…,” “Chernobyl,” “Dune: Prophecy,” “Hacks,” “House of the Dragon” and “The Last of Us.” Its companion shows for Apple TV+ include podcasts for “Foundation” and “Severance.” According to its website, Pineapple also sold multiple originals for TV and film development, including “Wind of Change” to Hulu, “Missing Richard Simmons” to Amazon Studios, “Heaven’s Gate” to HBO Max and “The Clearing” to Chernin Entertainment. Audacy plans to continue producing podcasts in association with other media companies. Pineapple Street had produced the first two seasons of Apple TV+’s official “Severance” podcast. Going forward, that is now being produced by Audacy Podcasts, in partnership with Red Hour and Great Scott. Five new episodes of “The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller & Adam Scott” will be released weekly on Thursdays beginning June 26, available across all podcast platforms. In addition, a set of new episodes is slated to be released in the fall of 2025. According to the Pineapple Street Studios site, the company was founded in 2016 by Jenna Weiss-Berman and Max Linsky. The studio has staff based in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Atlanta. In March, Audacy named Kelli Turner its permanent president and CEO while also announcing the departure of four top execs. The shutdown of Pineapple Street was first reported by Bloomberg. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Grads facing tough job market

WASHINGTON — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades. The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration’s tariff increases, which could slow growth. “Young people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,” Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. “The people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.” The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law. Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Title: Salesforce CEO Claims Half of the Company’s Work Is Now Done by AI

While many companies that went all in on AI have since pulled back, Salesforce is going full steam ahead. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Marc Benioff claimed that as much as 30% to 50% of the company’s work is now completed by AIâthough no word on how much of his role personally has been made redunant or how much of his $39.6 million in compensation that he’ll be giving up. âAll of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work,â Benioff said. In the case of some of Salesforce’s employees, the whole “move on to do higher value work” thing will have to happen somewhere else. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was laying off 1,000 people. It also reportedly plans to hire another 1,000 who will be focused on selling the company’s own AI agent technology, Agentforce. Put another way, Salesforce is hiring real people to sell other companies on adopting AI to replace some of its human workforce, which certainly seems like it would be one of the ten plagues of late-stage capitalism. Benioff and Salesforce are far from the only firm that is signaling that they will push for the AI revolution, whether it’s ready or not. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent a letter to employees talking up the use of generative AI across the company’s workflows, while slipping in a little note about how AI will lead to Amazon needing “fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That seems to be the underlying message of much of tech’s embrace of AI: get ready for layoffs. Silicon Valley has gone from bragging about how many jobs it can create to bragging about how small it can shrink its workforce. Microsoft is in the midst of a second round of layoffs, per Fast Company, after already cutting its staff by 6,000 in May and shifting lots of money into AI investments. Other companies like Google and Bumble have been trimming people from departments within their firms, as well. According to Layoffs.fyi, the tech industry has laid off more than 63,000 workers in 2025 so far. Oftentimes, whether it’s made explicit or not, corporate adoption of AI is the underlying reason for the cuts. Brian Merchant, author of Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech, recently spoke with tech workers who have been affected by AI and found that the technology is reshaping jobs and workforces as a whole. An employee of CrowdStrike told Merchant that while the company positioned its recent layoff as cutting underperforming employees, many of them were new hires who the company decided were replaceable. “AI has literally killed many jobs at CrowdStrike this week.” Another at Dropbox said that their team that focused on improving the service’s reliability was let go in favor of promoting a new AI-powered tool. artificial intellienceLaborlayoffsmarc benioffSalesforce Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992. While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes. The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government’s monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months. The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate — new hires as a percentage of all jobs — has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy. For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March — the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate. Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came. “Nobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,” Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. “My resume is full, there’s no gaps or anything. Every summer I’m doing something. It’s just, ‘OK, so what else are you looking for?’” She has returned to Clark for a master’s program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She’s hopeful it will lead to a job next year. Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin. Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, “teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company’s corporate work force over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy said in a message to employees. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, “Why hire a human when you could use AI?” Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology. Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn’t, said Kory Kantenga, the firm’s head of economics for the Americas. “We don’t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,” Kantenga said. He added that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow. In fact, IT’s hiring spree when rates were low — fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing — left many firms with too many workers, economists say. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It’s a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak. Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field. She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said. She has her college diploma, but hasn’t hung it up yet. “I will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,” she said.

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — While completing a master’s degree in data analysis, Palwasha Zahid moved from Dallas to a town near Silicon Valley. The location made it easy to visit the campuses of tech stalwarts such as Google, Apple, and Nvidia. Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn’t found a job in the industry that surrounds her. “It stings a little bit,” she said. “I never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.” Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Time Published: 2025-06-26T11:00:09Z
Full Content:
by Mike June 26, 2025 Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it â these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My momâs boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but itâs still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, âI got a rock.â Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasnât going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says youâre family, just remember that itâs the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasnât so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidaysâ¦..Iâm Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word âHopeâ. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partnerâs company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said âhappy appreciation weekâ. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, âshe did not want me missing the company bonusâ. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldnât wear denim at work so the only time weâd be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when weâd have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we canât wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places donât give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Couldâve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we canât wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. Iâm guessing OP didnât get a new car as a gift, soâ¦ got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a âfree turkeyâ around the holidays. It wasnât really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didnât cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurantâs âsignatureâ steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. Weâve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat âfor the companyâ. We didnât get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: How Amazon, Duolingo, Spotify, and Others Say AI Will Reshape Staffing
URL: https://www.adweek.com/media/amazon-duolingo-spotify-ai-reshape-staffing/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T07:02:23Z
Full Content:
Tech companies once blamed layoffs on overhiring and market shifts—now it’s AI. Recent statements from firms like Amazon, Shopify, British Telecom, Duolingo, and Klarna suggest that automation is reducing demand for human workers. As these companies pour heavily into AI, they’re simultaneously streamlining costs mostly through layoffs. In 2024, 549 tech firms laid off approximately 152,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. At the same time, many CEOs are championing “AI-first” strategies and touting productivity gains. But the workforce may not be ready, with only 62% of employees having received any AI-related training, even as companies push to scale AI across their operations, according to Gartner. “We’re at this moment where making big statements is about getting attention and drawing focus to the fact that AI is being used for real business impact,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK. “Rather than the tangible, long-term conversation around what does it really look like to re-skill and up-skill talent for a modern workforce.” Former Publicis chief strategist and growth officer Rishad Tobaccowala said the shift is also about rebalancing power. Companies may need 20% to 25% fewer people for the same output, he said, but that future will rely on a new kind of worker, one who can collaborate with AI. “People are talking about AI strategy… that’s the stupidest thing in the world,” he said. “You need to figure out how your entire strategy is changed because of AI.” Here’s what company leaders have said publicly about how they believe AI will impact their workforce, in alphabetical order. Amazon Action: Since 2022, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees across multiple divisions. While the company initially cited macroeconomic uncertainty, recent statements from leadership suggest AI is becoming a key factor in how it envisions future staffing. What it said: In a June blog post, CEO Andy Jassy pointed to the company’s deep investment in generative AI—highlighting over 1,000 services and applications in progress—and signaled a shift in how work gets done. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents,” he wrote, “it should change the way our work is done… [and] we’ll need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” While Jassy didn’t specify which roles would be affected, he noted that the company expects to see workforce reductions in the coming years as it leans into AI-driven efficiency. Jassy also pointed to advertising as a clear example of AI integration, citing Amazon’s suite of tools that help brands plan, onboard, create, and optimize campaigns, used by over 50,000 advertisers in Q1. British Telecom Action: British Telecom plans to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030, roughly 40% of its 130,000-person workforce. Of those, at least 10,000 roles could be replaced by AI, according to The Financial Times. What it said: CEO Allison Kirkby told FT the company is exploring the full impact of AI and suggested that, “depending on what we learn from AI … there may be an opportunity for BT to be even smaller by the end of the decade.” The company has already begun integrating generative AI into customer-facing roles, including sales and support operations. Duolingo Action: Cut around 10% of its contractor workforce in 2023, as it turns to AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 to streamline content production and translations. What it said: CEO Luis von Ahn has positioned the company as “AI-first,” saying that achieving that vision means rethinking “much of how we work,” and “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, Duolingo is placing “constructive constraints” on hiring: headcount will only be approved if a team “cannot automate more of their work.” The company is also experimenting with AI in hiring and performance reviews. Klarna Action: Klarna has reduced its workforce by about 40%, with CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski telling CNBC in May that the cuts are largely due to AI. The Swedish fintech company previously said it planned to shrink its headcount from 3,800 to 2,000 employees over the next few years. The company posted a $99 million loss in Q1, attributing it to one-off costs related to depreciation, share-based payments, and restructuring. What it said: In marketing specifically, CMO David Sandström told ADWEEK that team size reductions were driven in part by the growing capabilities of generative AI, and that further cuts could follow as the technology evolves. Shopify Action: Shopify has trimmed its workforce in the last two years, first by 14% in 2022, followed by another 20% in 2023. The company ended 2024 with 8,100 employees, down from 8,300 the previous year, per the company’s filing. What it said: In a memo to employees, which CEO Tobi Lütke posted on X, Shopify laid out a new baseline: “Reflexive AI usage,” in other words, all staffers tinkering with AI, is now expected across the company. Teams requesting headcount must first explain why the work can’t be done with AI. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?” Lütke wrote. The company also said it plans to add AI-related questions to its performance and peer review processes. Trishla is an Adweek staff reporter covering tech policy.

Title: Will AI really shrink workforces as Amazon boss says?

Andy Jassy is not the first executive to warn about the broader adoption of artificial intelligence and how it will fundamentally reshape the workforce. Are the doomsayers right? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently announced that his company would reduce its workforce as artificial intelligence (AI) replaces human employees. He also warned that AI will affect a wide range of jobs and sectors. Jassy is not alone, as many other tech firms have issued similar warnings about how AI breakthroughs could reshape their workforce. In May, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic told the Arlington, Virginia-based American news website Axios that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years. US public companies have reduced the number of their white-collar staff by a collective 3.5% over the past three years, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing employment data provider Live Data Technologies. Over the past decade, one in five companies in the S&P 500 have shrunk, it said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Several tech companies, including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Procter & Gamble, have announced layoffs of thousands of workers over the past several months. Recently, retail service provider Shopify said teams requesting additional staff would first need to prove that AI could not perform the tasks. Duolingo, a language-learning app, also plans to gradually replace its external workers with AI. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has estimated that a quarter of jobs worldwide are at a high risk of being replaced by AI automation. But AI is also expected to create new opportunities and boost productivity. A report by the World Economic Forum earlier this year forecast that technological transformation would displace about 92 million existing jobs by 2030, while creating 170 million new ones. Jobs in developed economies will likely be more affected by AI than those in developing ones. A study published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year found that the technology could affect 60% of jobs in developed economies — around half of them negatively, while the other half will see a positive impact. The report concluded that about 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 26% of jobs in low-income countries would be hit. But while these labor markets may see a smaller initial impact from AI, they are also less likely to benefit from the increased productivity that AI promises. During past technological breakthroughs, lower-skilled and blue-collar workers bore the brunt, such as workers on factory floors being replaced by robots. However, broad AI adoption is expected to hit higher-educated, white-collar workers hard, particularly those with tasks that AI could perform at a similar or better quality than a human worker. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center in the US found that occupations involving information gathering and data analysis, such as web developers, technical writers, accountants and data entry workers, among others, would be at high risk of being replaced by AI. Labor-intensive jobs that can't be easily automated, like construction workers, child care workers and firefighters, are expected to remain the most resilient. The possibility of massive job losses has triggered concerns over the disruptive effects of AI on employment and society, drawing the attention of politicians and even religious leaders. Pope Leo XIV, who became the head of the Catholic Church in May, has warned of the threat posed by AI to jobs and human dignity. Labor market expert Enzo Weber from the Institute of Employment Research in Nuremberg, Germany, believes the concerns over job losses are misplaced. Speaking with DW, he said AI advancements open up a wide range of economic possibilities and are more likely to help workers than cause mass unemployment. "AI primarily changes work, but it does not fundamentally eliminate it," said Weber, adding that the technology in most cases helps human workers "develop new tasks and perform their tasks better rather than just replacing them." A paper published in January by Harvard economists David Deming, Christopher Ong and Lawrence H. Summers shared a similar view. The economists argued that the automation of individual job tasks "does not necessarily reduce employment" and may even lead to "job gains in some sectors" of the economy. "In principle, being able to automate a previously onerous task could make workers so much more productive that the increased output offsets the fact that some of their work is now being done by a machine," they stated in the paper. Stressing that the impact of AI is likely to be "widespread and long-lasting," they also wrote that "history teaches us that even if AI disrupts the labor market, its impact will unfold over many decades." Given that artificial intelligence technology is still in its early stages, its precise longer-term impact on global labor markets remains uncertain. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The efficacy of many AI tools will also depend on how well they are integrated into workplaces, and the willingness and ability of workers to use them. If workers refrain from making full use of AI out of concern for their jobs, it could compromise the productivity boost the new technology promises. Labor market expert Weber urged companies and workers to adapt to the changing technology landscape and seize the opportunities because for him AI technology is a "game changer." "This [technology] presents opportunities, but they need to be seized. Further development and active training of workers are essential. Not just to keep pace, but to get as far ahead as possible."

Title: Bernie Sanders Slams Job Cuts, Says AI Should Give Workers More Time Off: 'Instead Of Throwing You Out On The Street...'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is advocating for a 32-hour workweek, citing the potential for advancements in artificial intelligence and automation to provide workers with more personal time. What Happened: Sanders, in a recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, outlined his vision for a future where AI and automation drive increased productivity and efficiency, leading to reduced working hours for employees. “Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m going to reduce your workweek to 32 hours,” Sanders stated. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The Vermont senator underscored the potential benefits of technology for workers, suggesting it could offer more time for family, friends and education. Sanders introduced the “Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act” last year, which mandates overtime pay for any work beyond 32 hours in a week. The proposed change would be gradually implemented over a four-year period. See Also: Peter Thiel turned $1,700 into $5 billion—now accredited investors are eyeing this software company with similar breakout potential. Learn how you can invest with $1,000 at just $0.30/share. Why It Matters: The proposal comes at a time when the impact of AI and automation on the workforce is a hot topic. Just days before Sanders’ podcast appearance, Microsoft MSFT announced its third round of layoffs for 2025, primarily targeting the sales team and other customer-facing roles. This move was attributed to AI-driven workforce shifts. Similarly, Amazon AMZN CEO Andy Jassy recently warned that AI would reduce the company's corporate workforce due to efficiency gains, sparking backlash from employees. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that U.S. companies are short on workers who can code software, secure networks and run complex projects.

Title: Devastating Layoffs Hit the Walt Disney Company

in Disney, Entertainment Credit: Disney In a recent report by TheWrap, it has been revealed that The Walt Disney Company is once again reducing its workforce, this time within its Entertainment and ESPN product and technology divisions. According to an unnamed source familiar with the matter, approximately 2% of the staff in these divisions has been let go as part of a broader rebalancing of resources. Despite the layoffs, Disney has emphasized that this move will not slow down its commitment to investing in product and technology growth. The company has been taking steps to streamline operations and adjust to the evolving media landscape, even as it continues to expand in other areas. This round of layoffs marks the fifth such occurrence in just a year at Disney. However, sources suggest that these cuts are distinct from previous ones, as they are not directly tied to any of the earlier rounds of job reductions. The decision is seen as part of Disney’s broader effort to optimize resources across its divisions, ensuring long-term success in the face of a rapidly changing entertainment environment. Led by Adam Smith, who joined Disney in 2024, the product and technology division has undergone significant changes under his leadership. Smith’s team has been actively working on enhancing Disney’s streaming platforms, particularly Disney+ and Hulu, with a focus on improving user experience and expanding subscriber perks. Notably, Disney has recently cracked down on password sharing for its streaming services, introduced new benefits for subscribers, and made strides in improving ad targeting through a new partnership with Amazon. Disney has also been exploring new ways to enhance the viewing experience. One of the latest initiatives includes the introduction of virtual “concessions stands” and “storefronts” within its streaming platforms, allowing viewers to purchase products directly related to the shows they are watching. Additionally, Disney is gearing up for the launch of a new ESPN streaming service later this fall, a move that marks the company’s continued push into the digital and sports streaming space. While these ongoing restructuring efforts are reshaping Disney’s internal operations, the company’s strategic goals remain focused on growth and innovation, particularly in the product and technology sectors. This wave of job cuts follows a larger trend of layoffs at Disney. Just earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its entertainment and corporate financial divisions. Back in early 2025, under 200 employees from ABC News Group and its entertainment networks were also let go. This followed a series of cuts last fall that saw hundreds of corporate employees and ABC staff members losing their jobs. As Disney continues to adapt to the changing media landscape, the company’s commitment to innovation and product development remains a central focus, despite the ongoing workforce reductions. As the year progresses, Disney fans and industry observers alike will be keeping a close eye on how these changes will affect the company’s future growth and strategic direction. in Disney, Entertainment Eva was born and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon but has since relocated and lives in New York City.
