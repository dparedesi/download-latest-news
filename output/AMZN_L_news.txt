AmazonLayoffsLord of the Rings Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development workâspecifically around MMOsâwithin Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG. âWhile weâre proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development workâspecifically around MMOsâwithin Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,â Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, reports Bloomberg. Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO New World. It’s only other hits like Lost Ark and Throne and Liberty were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next Tomb Raider game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed Lord of the Rings MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled. The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar. Amazon has also reworked its Prime Game program and seemingly scaled back ambitions for its video streaming platform Twitch over the years. Its gaming retreat comes as companies race to exploit a new gold rush in AI technology. “Some may ask why weâre reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Amaozn’s head of people experience, Beth Galetti, wrote in a new blog post on Tuesday. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Amazon cuts 14,000 corporate jobs
URL: https://www.wsbradio.com/news/business/amazon-cuts-14000/CZQJ3GLTDU4Q3B5SRBHJYX3QDM/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T16:44:18Z

Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can't find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon's corporate workforce in the next few years. Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Amazon has announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said that the potential for growth in the company's AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been a pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during the government shut down, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year's holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon's corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom-line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Amazon Games Unit Hit by Layoffs, Will Halt ‘Significant Amount’ of AAA Development and Shift Online Strategy

By Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer Amid sweeping layoffs that began throughout ecommerce giant Amazon Tuesday, the company is making “significant” changes to its video games business. The move comes on the heels of Amazon launching new game “King of Meat” (pictured above), and just as the company had unveiled its revamped cloud-gaming platform Luna and outlined plans to continue internal development on big-budget AAA titles (including massively multiplayer online games) alongside its new push for party games. Related Stories Best Friend Forever Lands World Sales, Gebeka Nabs French Rights for ‘Papaya,’ Supervised by Oscar-Nominated Alê Abreu (EXCLUSIVE) Morocco Set as 2026 European Film Market Country in Focus An undisclosed number of cuts have been made in the Amazon Game Studios business, as first reported by Bloomberg’s Jason Schrier and confirmed by Variety, as part of the overall elimination of 14,000 corporate workers at Amazon this week. Popular on Variety Amazon audio, Twitch and games boss Steve Boom says that while the layoffs are happening in connection with the overall company cuts, these reductions also indicate a larger strategy shift within the games business, which consists of Amazon Game Studios, led by Christoph Hartmann, and Amazon Luna, overseen by Jeff Gattis. “Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best,” Boom wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday, which was obtained by Variety. “We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.” Boom added: “We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.” According to Boom, Amazon is “continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming ‘Tomb Raider’ title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game,” as Amazon’s Montreal game studio is finishing work on its “March of Giants” game, while Studio 5 (the team behind Luna’s new “Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg”) “will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games.” Last week, Amazon Luna relaunched (the cloud-gaming service first debuted in 2022) with a new lineup of premium third-party games, including “Hogwarts Legacy” and Xbox’s “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,” and a UI update, as well as a party game collection labeled “GameNight.” Earlier this month, Boom told Variety that the overhaul of Luna didn’t signal a shift away from Amazon developing its own AAA titles, but that it did indicate plans to focus more on “console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns.” “If you were to trace the arc of what we’ve released and what we’ve now announced from our games studio, it would actually point in this direction,” Boom said. “So what started out in massively multiplayer games, MMOs, we’ve really widened the aperture, if you will. And so you’ve seen announcements for like things like ‘King of Meat,’ ‘Tomb Raider,’ our upcoming driving game, ‘Lord of the Rings,’ and kind of moving more in that direction of what I would call console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns. The MMOs, those are really PC games. We launched ‘New World’ on consoles about a year ago, and it’s done really, really well, but those games at their core appeal to the hardest core-PC gamers.” See below for Boom’s Tuesday memo to staff in its entirety. Dear Games Team, This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide. Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1. We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team. While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming Tomb Raider title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game. Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date. There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward. Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions. Thank you, Steve A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

It Takes Big Glass Balls to lay off 14,000 corporate employees, but that’s just what Amazon plans to do, according to an internal memo the company published online. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the company could cut up to 30,000 employees. It’s unclear who is getting the boot first, but the corporate layoffs are likely to touch every area of the company. Back in June, CEO Andy Jassy told the human world that AI could shrink the company’s workforce. Are progressive revenue taxes a threat to our little boomtown, or was it corporate greed all along? Mail Those Ballots: A new USPS policy could tack on delays for ballots sent by mail, and today is the last day the postal service recommends dropping your ballot in a mailbox. After that, get your ass to a ballot dropbox. Before you do, read our endorsements and Nathalie’s idiot-proof guide to voting. Weather: There’s a chance of rain before 1 pm, then a chance of rain after 2 pm. Worse Weather: The UN’s World Meteorological Organization expects the Category 5 Hurricane Melissa to be a “storm of the century” for Jamaica. The nation has never been hit by a Category 5 storm. Jamaica’s climate minister said the island is at “extreme” risk of flooding. CNN is posting live updates here. IT: Alaska Airlines’ IT grounded flights when it went kerplunk for 8 hours last week. A financial analyst told The Seattle Times it probably shaved about 15 cents off its share price, or a $26 million loss overall. Talk about fumbling in the fourth (financial) quarter. ICE Detains Wrong Guy: In Oregon, the bumbling Feds arrested and detained a man named Victor Cruz because they thought he was another Victor Cruz with a history of driving drunk. Cruz is still in ICE detention and congressional Democrats in Oregon are demanding his release. He has a valid work permit and has a pending U visa, which allows crime victims to legally stay in the US. He doesn’t have a criminal record. He doesn’t have a deportation order. And though he was arrested two weeks ago, as of Friday he wasn’t in the detainee locator system. He’s supposed to be there after 48 hours. USA Kills Another 14 People: Our military struck another four alleged drug boats in the Eastern Pacific yesterday, said Secretary of WAR Pete Hegseth. We’re up to 50 extrajudicial killings in our war on supposed drug cartels, or boats, it’s hard to say. Seattle Judge Foils Trump Plan to Make More Children Mentally Ill: The Trump administration must release millions of dollars in grants to address a shortage of school counselors, psychologists and social workers. Congress funded the program after the Uvalde shooting, but Trump’s admin ended it over DEI considerations in the grants. The preliminary ruling in US District Court is limited, applying only to some grantees in the sixteen blue states that sued. The ruling will stay in place while the case moves on. Trump Admin Fires Seattle Immigration Judge: It’s unclear why Judge Susana Reyes lost her job, or why any of the other federal judges who received termination notices on September 11 lost theirs. But most of them were hired when Biden was president. Without Reyes, the remaining eight immigration judges share a caseload of 50,000, reports KING 5. Trump in Japan: The President met with the newly elected first female Prime Minister of Japan, Sanae Takaichi. She’s a heavy metal drummer, but not cool. She’s ultraconservative and her mentor was former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. They signed two trade agreements, including a less than one-page agreement for the golden age of our alliance and a framework for securing rare-earth minerals. Here’s the AP’s liveblog of the visit. The Truck: To impress Trump, Japan floated the idea of purchasing a fleet of F-150s. They even parked a gold-hued one outside the Akasaka Palace where Trump is staying. When Takaichi said she might make the F-150 part of his trip, he said “she has good taste” … “that’s a hot truck.” No It Isn’t: Ford F-150s were too big for the parking lot at my Texas high school, where everything is bigger, including parking lots. Japan is an island that already makes the Kei, the world’s greatest pickup. Fork You: A Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Germany was diverted to Boston after a man stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork. The man, 28, was charged with one count of assault with a deadly weapon and intent to do harm. According to NBC News, the man stabbed one teen in the clavicle and the other in the back of the head. When the flight attendants tried to subdue him, he allegedly “formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger.” He also slapped a woman. If those tray tables could talk. MAHA Moment: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Tylenol maker Kenvue and its former parent company Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday, alleging they knew the painkiller could cause autism. Tylenol does not cause autism. Texas is the first state to file such a case. In Paxton’s defense, he’s very stupid. MAGA Moment: Republicans are trying to undo every Joe Biden pardon signed by autopen. In a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee alleged that Biden was in such a state of cognitive decline that he didn’t know what he was signing. They want Bondi’s lyin’ Department of Justice to launch an investigation. Biden has publicly disputed the claim and the report does not include any evidence that Biden wasn’t making his decisions. If the pardons are void, the administration could prosecute more of Trump’s political enemies. Vivian McCall is The Stranger's News Editor. In her private life, she is a musician and Wii U apologist.

ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. Even though the economy appears uncertain, geopolitics are volatile and inflation is trending in the wrong direction, a new report from McKinsey & Company shows that businesses might miss out by delaying expansion. Companies that are building new ventures have seen relatively quick and decisive success, the report shows. It also revealed that new ventures launched by large businesses can now scale with 40% less capital. They’re also making more money faster. For ventures started in the last five years, 61% made annual revenue above $10 million this year—an increase from 45% in 2023. About the same percentage said the new venture broke even in its first two years of operation. Many of these successful new ventures, the report says, come from expanding into areas their company already does business. A similar report from McKinsey last year found that nearly nine in 10 business leaders said their organizations had assets with unrealized potential. This year, 72% of those companies that built ventures to take advantage of those assets reported above-average growth. Six in 10 new ventures this year were within the larger corporation’s primary business area, and many used expansion playbooks from other companies. AI is helping to build and scale these new ventures quickly. The report mentioned companies that used AI to mine customer and competitor data to find unmet needs. AI can be used to build business models, identify high-value target customers, and generate insights and analytics for predictive modeling. Close to three-quarters of companies that have built three or more new ventures in the last five years are using AI for complex activities. Corporate culture also contributes to this success. Companies that prize innovation and creativity, emboldening employees to experiment without fearing failure, lead easily to successful venture building. More than two-thirds of successful builders had this kind of culture. More than half of successful builders also invested in upskilling programs for employees to learn technology and business design skills. Another area that leads to growth is an investment in customer success. ERP software provider Certinia recently analyzed more than 4,000 earnings reports and found that companies that mention customer success alongside net revenue retention performed better. I talked to Certinia CFO Erin Sawyer and Head of Global Product and Solution Marketing Damian Trzebunia about the connection. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

As the federal government shutdown enters its fourth week with no end in sight, the drag on the economy—both now and in the future—is becoming apparent. Delayed government inflation data for September was released on Friday, revealing that inflation continued to tick up last month. Prices were up 3% compared with a year ago, and had risen 0.3% since August. And consumer sentiment continues to decline, with the University of Michigan’s monthly survey dropping 2.7% to a score of 53.6. According to the survey, Americans’ views on current economic conditions fell to the same level as August 2022, when inflation was 8.3%. Focusing only on businesses, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that this shutdown is likely to suppress Q4 GDP growth by as much as 0.5%, though not completely neutralize growth or turn it negative. How much it will hurt is not known, especially since negotiations do not appear to be underway. The most recent government shutdown in 2018 and 2019, which was also the longest on record, had an impact of $18 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Moore wrote. Much of the planned spending for that period happened anyway, but was delayed, so the lost spending was estimated at $3 billion. Some economic policy changes may be close on the horizon, though. The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets later this week and will discuss interest rates. According to CME FedWatch, on Tuesday morning 97.8% of analysts are expecting a quarter-point rate cut this week, bringing rates down to between 3.75% and 4%. But that’s not necessarily great news. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes that the conditions may be ripe for stagflation—when economic growth is tepid, but inflation and unemployment are both rising. Other potential policy changes are contributing to greater success in the stock market, which has posted a record-setting rally, up 36% over the last six months. On Monday, following news of a framework trade deal negotiated between the U.S. and China that could withdraw the 100% tariffs President Donald Trump announced two weeks ago, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at record highs. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet on Wednesday to discuss the deal further—though the New York Times reports that it would largely reset U.S.-China trade to where it was before Trump took office and started his trade war. Online behemoth Amazon announced Tuesday morning it’s laying off 14,000 corporate staff. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post that the company is performing well, but they’re seeking places to “remove layers, increase ownership and realize efficiency gains.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” she wrote. “We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” This is just the beginning of big changes at Amazon because of AI. Forbes contributor Rachel Wells writes that internal strategy documents first reported on by the New York Times suggest that AI, robots and automation in general will replace 600,000 human jobs at the company by 2033. Wells writes that aside from administrative roles, the jobs most likely targeted by these layoffs include warehouse workers and order fulfillment operatives, as well as entry-level logistics, coding and customer service positions. However, Amazon has said it plans to hire the same number of seasonal employees it always does: 250,000 across full- and part-time positions during the end-of-year shopping season. Amazon isn’t the only company announcing large job cuts this morning. In its earnings call, UPS CEO Carol Tomé said so far this year, the shipping and logistics company has reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions, and its operational workforce by about 34,000 positions, the Wall Street Journal reported. The reductions were a combination of layoffs and buyouts. Following the announcement, UPS stock was up more than 7%. Tech companies have helped propel the stock market to new heights, prompting fears of an “AI bubble” set to burst—similar to the dot-com bubble in the early years of the internet that tanked company valuations. Forbes assistant managing editor Jeffrey Marcus collected several pieces written by members of Forbes’ contributor network on the topic. Some, like Jon Markman, write that this boom is built on solid technology gain, real demand and growing computing requirements. But Peter Cohan writes that there could be real danger, especially if a capital-intensive, not-yet-profitable company like OpenAI runs out of funding sources. Forbes’ Ty Roush turned to the real experts: AI chatbots. He asked seven of them to respond to the following prompt: “In 100 words or fewer, do you believe there is an ‘AI bubble’?” Answers varied. xAI’s Grok said there is one, noting that excitement about the potential of the technology has “driven massive investments, inflated valuations and unrealistic expectations, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble.” Many AI startups, it said, “lack sustainable business models,” and the “gap between promised breakthroughs and actual deliverables is growing.” ChatGPT explained that there is some “classic bubble behavior,” but said the technology is delivering real utility. Perplexity said there could be an emerging AI bubble, but said, “The risk lies not in AI itself but in unrealistic market expectations.” All the chatbots said that any AI-related stock market correction wouldn’t lead to a collapse. Grok said “economic corrections” would focus on “weeding out overhyped projects while strengthening viable ones.” Excitement surrounding AI will “stabilize,” ChatGPT said, leaving behind “mature, deeply integrated AI systems as part of everyday life.” In an analysis of more than 4,000 earnings reports from publicly traded companies between 2022 and now, ERP solutions company Certinia found that companies that mentioned consumer success (CS) and net revenue retention (NRR) performed better across the board. Market leaders referenced these two metrics 50% more often than other companies, and those that talked about customer success as a concrete strategy saw better results. I spoke with Certinia CFO Erin Sawyer and Head of Global Product and Solution Marketing Damian Trzebunia about the study and what it means for companies. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you define customer success? Trzebunia: We think of customer success through two lenses. One is simply as a department. Recently, we surveyed the services industry and we found that 70% of our customers have a dedicated customer success function, and they’re held accountable for metrics: churn, retention, renewals, net revenue retention. Net revenue retention, in particular, has become a primary indicator of financial health and future performance. It’s a very relevant metric for the CFO, but we also think of it as a cross-functional discipline. In order for the customer to get the very best outcome, we believe that sales, professional services, delivery and customer success have to be aligned: working from the same definition of a customer, the same unified data foundation. They have to have workflows that are unified, and only then can they work together in the service of the very best outcome for the customer. The study seemed to insinuate that if you thought that customer success was dead, it is not. How is its importance growing? Trzebunia: One of the things that we found in the report is that mentions of CS and NRR have been steadily increasing every year, so it’s been on companies’ radar. What’s interesting in this report is how companies talk about customer success in net revenue retention. The best performers point to it frequently, but they also speak of it as something they’ve invested in operationalizing, and make it truly part of their core strategy. Whereas everyone else talks about it aspirationally. It’s almost an afterthought. We’ve been living in the age of the customer for a long time. There’s so much business literature centered around the customer that in the last couple decades. That’s not new, but it’s the focus, attention and the intent. It’s really operationalizing that cross-functional discipline that is ultimately going to drive NRR metrics. That’s the difference: It’s how companies think about it, approach it and invest. Sawyer: Having it siloed is not impactful for the organization. Operationalizing it across the company is really what helps in the full customer journey to make the customer successful. The study showed companies that talked more about customer success and net revenue retention on their earnings calls saw their stock prices do better immediately afterwards. What is it about these metrics that inspires more confidence in the markets? Sawyer: Higher net revenue retention rates are a competence metric in the company itself: The customers have confidence in the value that the company is providing to both stay with the company and continue to invest in it. That’s really the financial indicator of health, confidence and the strategic direction that the company is going: what they are producing overall, as well as their engagement with the customer. It’s a really strong confidence metric that the company’s customers are putting within the company itself to say: I believe in the value that they’re delivering. How can a company begin making the big move, investing in customer success and operationalizing this function across different departments? Trzebunia: One starting point would be just having clean, unified data: A common definition of a customer so that sales, delivery and customer success are all looking at the same up-to-date data about a customer would be a huge step forward. We know that data integrity is a real challenge for enterprises. It also happens to be one of the largest barriers to AI adoption because AI feeds on data. It’s only going to be as good and as effective as the underlying data, the processes and the workflow. I think so many customers—large brands, blue chip brands—are still doing a lot of this on spreadsheets. They’re not really set up for success. What we’ve seen with our customers is that when their data is unified and they start to unify workflows across these customer success functions, that starts to spark the right culture. Now there are fewer silos, fewer barriers. There’s much more openness, collaboration, working together in the service of the customer. That prepares you to adopt AI in a responsible way, a meaningful way that’s really going to drive results for you: the right results. The business world is changing faster now than ever before.

Title: Amazon's Massive Job Cuts Come Just Months After CEO Warned AI Would Reduce Workforce

Amazon plans to eliminate approximately 14,000 corporate positions in the coming months, as CEO Andy Jassy turns to AI to streamline the company’s workforce and reduce expenses. Jassy had warned the company’s employees that AI-driven job reductions would be coming soon. Bloomberg reports that in a major restructuring move, Amazon.com has announced plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate jobs across various departments, including logistics, payments, video games, and cloud computing. Initial reports put the job cuts at 30,000, which may include future waves of layoffs beyond the initial job cuts. The decision comes just months after CEO Andy Jassy warned that the increasing use of artificial intelligence would likely lead to a reduction in the company’s workforce. This marks the second significant round of layoffs for Amazon in the last several years. In late 2022 and early 2023, the company cut more than 18,000 corporate employees as part of Jassy’s efforts to reduce costs following the pandemic-driven boom. Since then, there have been smaller, more targeted layoffs affecting individual teams within the company. While Amazon employs a total of approximately 1.55 million people as of June 30, the majority of them work in warehouses. The corporate workforce, which will be affected by the 14,000 job cuts, comprises about 350,000 personnel, representing a four percent reduction in that segment. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, stated in a blog post that the reductions are part of the company’s ongoing efforts to become stronger by reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and reallocating resources to focus on its biggest bets. She also noted that Amazon will continue to hire in some parts of the business, and the 14,000 figure represents an overall workforce reduction. Breitbart News reported in June that Jassy warned of AI-driven job cuts to come: Amazon, the second-largest private employer in the United States, is bracing for a significant shift in its workforce as AI technology advances. In a memo sent to employees on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy warned that the company expects AI to reduce its total corporate workforce in the next few years, as the technology brings efficiency gains across various departments. Jassy’s memo, which was also made public, highlighted the potential impact of AI on both corporate workers, such as software developers, and employees in Amazon warehouses. He stated that AI would “improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots” in the company’s fulfillment centers. Other tech giants are also cutting workers in favor of AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently revealed that the company is saving about $100 million a year by using AI to handle customer support, resulting in a reduction of thousands of people in their customer support workforce. Similarly, Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff informed employees that AI tools have boosted productivity in various areas, saving the company more than $500 million last year in its call centers alone. Before becoming CEO of the entire company, Jassy headed up Amazon Web Services (AWS), which crashed a considerable portion of the internet last week. Read more at Bloomberg here.

Amazon laid off employees within its devices division as part of a plan to cut 14,000 corporate roles, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider. Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI." The devices division is behind the research and development of Amazon's consumer electronics products, including the Kindle, Fire, and Echo devices. It is unclear how many devices employees were impacted by the layoffs. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: "Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products," Roy wrote in a memo posted by an employee to Amazon's internal Slack. "In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes." Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti announced the broader cuts on Tuesday, saying the company is becoming leaner because AI is allowing companies to innovate faster than ever before. "Team, I'm writing to provide an update following Beth's update on A to Z from earlier today regarding organizational changes. As with other teams across Amazon, we've taken a hard look at our level of investment for various programs, which is resulting in some roles being eliminated within the OS & Services org. These decisions were difficult, but were made thoughtfully to position our organization for future success. Notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization have now been completed for the U.S. and Canada. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees.

Title: Consumer confidence dips modestly in October as potential recession markers remain

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer confidence weakened slightly in October as Americans remain anxious about their future financial prospects. READ MORE: Social Security recipients will get an average increase of $56 per month The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell by 1 point to 94.6 in October from an upwardly revised September reading of 95.6. Economists were expecting the reading to come in unchanged from the previous month. One year ago, the reading was 109.5. A measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market dipped by 2.9 points to 71.5, remaining well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. However, consumers’ assessments of their current economic situation rose 1.8 points to 129.3. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers’ biggest concern. Mentions of tariffs declined again this month but remain elevated, the Conference Board said. Last week, government data showed that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in September as gas prices jumped while the cost of rents cooled, painting a mixed picture for consumers. While the economy is still growing steadily, hiring remains slow and more high-profile companies have recently announced layoffs. Consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August. The report on the consumer price index was issued more than a week late because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they will cut their key interest rate at their meeting Wednesday. It would be the second time this year even though inflation is above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited increasing concerns about the U.S. labor market, which, while broadly healthy by historical standards, is showing signs of deterioration this year. Responses to the Conference Board’s latest survey revealed that while respondents were slightly more positive about current job market, they are growing more concerned about their future employment prospects. The most recent government jobs report showed that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July’s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The government did not issue its September jobs report due to the shutdown. In addition to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023, economists say the recent hiring slump may also be a result of Trump’s policies, including his sweeping and ever-changing tariffs on imports, a crackdown on illegal immigration and purges of the federal workforce. Many companies have been locked in a “no hire, no fire” position, fearful of expanding payrolls until the effects of Trump’s tariffs are more clear. But in the past two weeks, there have been notable exceptions from major U.S. corporations. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while trimming costs elsewhere. Last week, Target said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions. Also last week, Meta Platforms said it was cutting roughly 600 positions and in September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores while laying off 900 nonretail employees. Survey respondents who said they intended to buy a new or used car in the near future rose. While the share of those saying they planned to purchase a home declined slightly this month, the broader six-month trend is still rising, the Conference Board said. Plans to buy big-ticket items like appliances was little changed from September. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: Amazon is reportedly aiming for as many as 30,000 corporate layoffs on its path to higher profitability

Amazon is preparing a significant corporate restructuring that could cut as many as 30,000 office-based roles, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The reductions are expected to start next week, and sources say the changes will primarily focus on its corporate groups, including operations, devices, services, and human resources. If the reported figure holds, the cuts would represent a significant portion of Amazon’s corporate workforce. Reuters characterises the total as in the low tens of thousands and says affected teams will be informed as the company implements the plan. The story relies on unnamed sources, and it is prudent to note that Amazon has not provided any comments at the time of writing. The potential layoff plan follows earlier rounds of job reductions across various Amazon divisions, and reflects broader cost-control efforts sweeping through the technology sector. The company, under CEO Andy Jassy, has signalled a push to simplify decision-making, reduce bureaucracy, and capture productivity gains, including through automation and AI, moves management has previously said could change how corporate teams are structured. Reuters reports the cuts are part of a broader effort to streamline operations and reallocate resources toward priority initiatives. Some roles may be consolidated or repurposed, sources told the outlet, while others could be eliminated. Details on severance, outplacement support, and exact timing were not included in the report. Large reductions obviously significantly lower payroll expenses, but they also often entail immediate restructuring charges, potential disruption to teams responsible for ongoing projects, and, in some cases, affect the day-to-day operations of a company. Historically, companies that undertake broad corporate cuts use the savings to redirect spending to strategic areas or investments. Beyond headline numbers, the effects will vary across teams. Projects tied to long-term product roadmaps may be slowed or even forgone, hiring freezes could be extended, and internal services could be centralised to reduce role duplication as the Seattle-based tech giant aims to unlock greater efficiency across the board. Historically, Amazon typically communicates layoffs internally before making public statements, so further information is likely to leak across the week as announcements roll out and teams receive formal notice. For employees and onlookers, the coming days should clarify which segments of Amazon’s sprawling business empire are most affected and how the e-commerce and data center giant plans to support those affected.

Title: Amazon laying off as many as 30,000 corporate workers in shift to AI

Amazon has announced plans to cut 14,000 of its 350,000 corporate jobs and replace those roles with AI. Others who work at the retail giant claim the actual layoffs will be closer to 30,000 people. MobileSyrup has reached out to see if any of the layoffs will impact Canadians, but did not receive a response before publication. Amazon also declined to comment to several other publications that covered the layoffs. Amazon’s press release regarding the layoffs says that most affected personnel will be given 90 days’ notice to make sure they have time to find a new job internally, and its recruiting teams are now instructed to focus on internal hires. That said, it doesn’t seem like it will have space to re-hire all these people. After speaking with anonymous Amazon workers, Reuters reported that the company was training its managers on how to conduct the layoffs on Monday. The same report also mentions that AWS alone made US$30.9 billion (roughly C$43.1 billion) in Q2 of this year. At least Amazon is being transparent about laying off workers because of AI. We’ve seen many other companies, and I won’t name names, lay off employees this year for mysterious reasons that were never shared, but from the outside looking in, it appears to be AI-related. Bloomberg has reported that this will impact people in logistics, payments, video games, and AWS teams. This isn’t Amazon’s first round of bad news for the company’s employees this year. Earlier this month, it also emerged that the company plans to use robots to fill 600,000 jobs by 2033. Amazon was also recently under fire for its decision to pull out of Quebec after warehouse workers unionized. Sources: Amazon, Bloomberg, Reuters

Title: Amazon to cut 14K roles in effort to stay ‘nimble’

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The company is betting AI will change its workforce needs and leaning into job cuts as a way to simplify its organizational structure. Amazon’s latest round of layoffs builds on CEO Andy Jassy’s remarks to employees in June that the company will need fewer people doing some existing jobs as generative AI continues to advance. Galetti told employees on Tuesday that the workforce cuts are intended to reduce bureaucracy, remove corporate layers and shift resources as the company works to stay “nimble.” “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti said in her note to employees. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).” "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," she said. The move from Amazon also builds on a note Jassy sent out in September 2024, wherein he flagged that the company would evaluate whether or not it had the proper organizational structure to foster the speed and innovation it desires. Amazon is not the first retailer this season to announce layoffs in a bid to simplify its structure and move faster. Target on Thursday informed employees that it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles. Despite the company’s sales declines, the announced cuts are not part of an effort to save costs but instead intended to reduce corporate complexity and more easily “bring ideas to life,” incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke said. “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” Amazon’s second quarter results in August showed online store sales increased 4.6% year over year to $55.4 billion and physical store sales improved 3.6% to $5.2 billion. However, the company during its earnings call with analysts was focused on the Amazon Web Services portion of its business, which continues to be a core part of its success.

Amazon reveals major job cuts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon has confirmed plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs as it looks to operate more effectively. In a note first shared with Amazon employees and then published online, the company noted the move would allow it to be "organized more leanly" and seize the opportunity provided by AI. Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology, noted the cuts would make Amazon "even stronger", meaning it could shift resources, "to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs". The move is reportedly a response to Amazon's overhiring during the pandemic, when demand for all kinds of products spiked, leading to a huge expansion. "We're convicted that we need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," Galetti added. Amazon has around 1.55 million employees across the entire company, but the cuts will affect its 350,000 corporate workers, with report claiming a number of divisions and roles could be hit, with human resources, known as People Experience and Technology (PXT), operations, devices and services; and Amazon Web Services teams all set to be affected. The move will be Amazon's largest ever job losses, ahead of the 27,000 positions it cut back in 2022 in a bid apparently to save on expenditure, and are slightly better than earlier reports claiming up to 30,000 workers could be let go. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Company CEO Andy Jassy had warned earlier in 2025 that the rise in AI technology in major corporations such as Amazon would likely lead to job cuts. "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs," he said in a memo sent to Amazon staff June 2025. "It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." Jassy added staff who embraced such changes would be "well-positioned" at the company, noting Amazon was already using AI agents in "virtually every corner of the company", adding, "many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming and coming fast." The news is the latest in a series of layoffs by tech giants in recent months as they take stock of their workforce in the new AI driven world. Meta recently cut 600 jobs in its AI division, with Salesforce confirming it had also lost 4000 support jobs in favor of AI tools. Around 9,000 Microsoft workers also lost their jobs in July 2025, with around 6,000 also going in May and several hundred in other, smaller adjustments.

Title: Jeff Bezos-Owned Amazon Axes Thousands of Jobs in Artificial Intelligence Bloodbath

Reporter Amazon has announced it will be scything more than 14,000 jobs as part of its efforts to streamline operations in the era of artificial intelligence. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” senior vice president Beth Galetti wrote in a message shared with employees Tuesday, titled, “Staying nimble and continuing to strengthen our organizations.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” she went on. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” A spokesperson for Amazon insisted artificial intelligence was not the reason behind the vast majority of reductions. “Last year, we set out to strengthen our culture and teams by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy to drive speed and ownership, and be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers,” the spokesperson told the Daily Beast. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work.” The dawn of artificial intelligence has revolutionized the labor market. Entry-level positions in the U.S. have dropped by 33 percent since the start of this year as experts warn new tech innovations could eliminate up to 100 million jobs over the next decade, with blue-collar workers expected to be the worst affected. Tuesday’s layoffs in corporate jobs came in lower than had been feared, with earlier reports suggesting 30,000 people may have been facing the axe. But it also comes amid reports of other significant firings, at retail giant Target and media conglomerate Paramount Skydance over the past few days, and at tech titan Meta, beverage manufacturer Molson Coors, and management consultant Booz Allen Hamilton. Andy Jassy, Amazon’s chief executive, had warned about the changes in advance. In June, per The Wall Street Journal, he sent a message to employees confirming increased use of AI platforms across the country would inevitably result in terminations. “​As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” he wrote then. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.” Amazon’s ruthless crusade for efficiency has sparked significant controversy in the past. Workers at warehouses across the U.S. and Europe have routinely complained of pressure to meet strict quotas, scanning hundreds of items per hour on grueling 10 to 12-hour shifts with minimal breaks. Journalistic investigations have documented injuries from repetitive strain and exhaustion, while whistleblowers have described “panic rooms” for employees who fall behind on productivity metrics, and some even collapsing from heat exhaustion in California’s “fulfillment centres.” Reporter will.neal@thedailybeast.com Got a tip?

Title: A TV Stunt Posed the Right Questions About AI and Jobs, and Failed to Answer Any

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Commentary: An episode of the documentary series Dispatches -- called Will AI Take My Job? -- captures where we stand with AI, in a most uncomfortable way. "Because I'm not real. In a British TV first, I'm actually an AI presenter." By the time I sat down to watch, the twist had already been spoiled for me. I knew from the get-go that the woman presenting the show wasn't real. Instead, she was AI dressed in a smart suit with a pitch-perfect British television accent – serious, soft and southern. UK broadcaster Channel 4 said its use of an AI presenter in its latest Dispatches documentary was a first in TV history. (Russian state media may have a prior claim.) The deepfake technology behind it generated a believable television presenter, who would have been entirely forgettable if it hadn't been for the novelty of the stunt. I'm not sure it's an experiment worth repeating. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. That's not just me being defensive about my job as a journalist; the presenter herself acknowledged her own limitations on screen. She's not on location to interact with any of the documentary's subjects, she points out. She's not able to conduct searching interviews or reach any Louis Theroux-style conclusions about what's taking place. At most points, she's little more than a voiceover. Her limitations reflect those of the wider experiment that took place in this episode of Dispatches, titled Will AI Take My Job? It saw four professionals -- a doctor, a lawyer, a photographer and a composer -- pitted against an AI rival in their line of work. Perhaps predictably, given the current stage of AI development, the challenges doled out to the workers and their AI counterparts were fairly one-dimensional tasks that represented a specific element of their job, rather than being a true expression of the multifaceted nature of their work. Only the photographer, who was tasked with a fashion photo shoot, "lost" the challenge -- although it should be noted that her AI "rival" was in fact a piece of software operated and directed by two people who were making a steady stream of creative decisions. Even when AI performed well, with ChatGPT reaching some diagnoses similar to those of the doctor, it's clear that its capabilities are ultimately limited. It could not, for example, examine the foot of the woman with plantar fasciitis to determine how much pain she was in and therefore what level of intervention might be appropriate. Similarly, an AI presenter might be a suitable stand-in if you were making a one-note educational or instructional video, but it wouldn't be able to fulfill all of the duties of journalists who usually make documentaries. These include finding human case studies, persuading them to take part, making them feel comfortable enough to open up on camera, and crafting what you find out from them into a compelling and cohesive narrative. (Channel 4 has said it doesn't plan to make a habit of using an AI presenter.) Still, the Dispatches documentary did capture where we are with AI at the moment. The professionals involved experienced the kind of discomfort and soul-searching that any of us might feel if we were confronted with a deepfake version of ourselves who challenged our money-making skill set or craft. Surveys show that workers are worried about AI taking their jobs. Perhaps the biggest failing of the documentary was that while it raised pertinent questions about AI, it then left them hanging without attempting answers. In the final five minutes of the show, Adam Cantwell-Corn, policy lead for the Trade Unions Congress Tech Project, and economist Daniel Susskind point out that a robust social security system is going to be necessary to deal with the unemployment caused by AI -- a challenge for which no government is currently prepared. The British government's response was to say: "We're determined people have the tools they need to take advantage of [AI], which is why we're working with leading tech firms to train a fifth of our workforce in AI over the coming years." The documentary then immediately segued into dropping the bomb about the AI presenter before ending abruptly. It didn't challenge the government's statement -- a missed opportunity. Pinning the solution to potential AI-induced mass unemployment -- polls show it's something people are very worried about -- on the hopes that tech companies will upskill us all in AI feels like asking the zombies to protect us during the apocalypse. It's naive at best, suicidal at worst. Tech companies have shown us time and again that they will prioritize profits over people. They don't even care about their own people, who they call family one day, then lay off with breathtakingly little compassion and respect the next. Governments would be delusional to think tech companies care one iota about the employment status of their citizens. One surefire way for tech companies to maximize profits is by minimizing headcount, both for themselves and their clients. (Witness this morning's layoffs at Amazon, which praised AI as a "transformative technology" even as it blandly noted the "need to be organized more leanly.") If we were to be really cynical, we might assume mass unemployment is not just an unfortunate consequence of Big Tech's pursuit of AI superintelligence, but the ultimate goal. Perhaps it feels less scary for governments to toss this hot potato back at the tech companies than to grapple with it themselves. Because when faced with the reality that successive political administrations have been dismantling our social safety net piece by piece, the idea of rebuilding it probably seems unappealing, intimidating and maybe even completely insurmountable. Maybe it wouldn't occur to an AI journalist to point this out. But to this flesh-and-blood journalist, why our governments aren't preparing to help us navigate what could be an unemployment crisis feels like the million-dollar question for which every worker everywhere deserves a proper answer.

Title: Amazon is pushing out thousands of workers into a job market that suddenly isn’t hiring

Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:12:31Z

Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the next few years. Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Jassy encouraged employees to get on board with the company’s AI plans after it announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to try to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said that the potential for growth in the company’s AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can’t find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been a pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during the government shut down, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year’s holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom-line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Amazon Confirms 14,000 Corporate Layoffs So It Can Move Faster on AI

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Amazon today confirmed plans to lay off 14,000 people in corporate roles amid a continued push on AI, though more cuts could be in store for 2026. The company is "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets," Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, wrote in a company-wide email that it also published online. Galetti's memo comes after Reuters reported yesterday that Amazon planned to cut "as many as 30,000 corporate jobs." She didn't address that number, but said Amazon expects to find "additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains" next year. Reuters reports the cuts will primarily affect those in HR, devices, services, and operations. Employees will hear today if they are affected. Amazon will offer "most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Those who cannot find a new role at Amazon will receive "transition support, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more," Galetti says. Some are already posting about being laid off on social media. "After years of pouring my heart into this company and its people, it’s surreal to say that this chapter is now closed," a senior recruiter with Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios wrote on LinkedIn. Usually this type of corporate cut would occur when a company is doing poorly, but Amazon had $18 billion in profit in the latest quarter, The New York Times reports. It's also increased spending on AI data centers. Amazon acknowledged this in its employee memo, citing its ambitions to move even faster in AI. "Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well," Galetti wrote. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)." Amazon plans to "operate like the world's largest startup," she added, a phrase CEO Andy Jassy first used in a September 2024 memo to employees in which he also announced a "bureaucracy mailbox," where employees could forward examples of "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out." Amazon also laid off approximately 27,000 people a few years ago. As of July, it had 1.55 million employees. Last week, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division, also citing the need to move faster, so even those who work in AI might not be safe in today's unpredictable tech climate. Last week, The New York Times reported that Amazon would ramp up the use of automation in its warehouses in the coming years, which would allow it to hire about 600,000 fewer human employees. Amazon pushed back on that characterization, however, and pointed to the 250,000 seasonal jobs it will once again add for the holiday rush.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon started notifying impacted employees in its plan to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider. Once such a notification email, sent by Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti and posted to Amazon's internal Slack, suggested that laid-off employees would receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days. Amazon declined to comment. It's unclear if the email is standard across Amazon, but the correspondence states that employees will receive a severance offer in addition to the 90-day paid non-working period. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: Galetti announced the layoffs on Tuesday, saying that while the company is performing well, it is making cuts in support of CEO Andy Jassy's vision to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." I have some important, but difficult, news to share with you. After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated and your employment will end after a non-working period We didn't make these decisions lightly, and we're committed to supporting you throughout this transition, which will include a non-working period with full pay and benefits (as applicable), an offer of a severance package, transitional benefits as applicable by country, and access to several skills trainings as well as external job placement support. You likely have questions, and we're here to answer them. You'll soon receive a Chime meeting invitation for a conversation with a leader and/or HR representative from your team to discuss the specifics of your transition and how we can support you. While this meeting is optional, we encourage you to attend virtually as it provides an opportunity to address your individual questions. Your badge access has been restricted, so if you're currently in an Amazon office, Security can assist you with exiting the building. Beyond this conversation, you can also review additional information and FAQs in MyHR at any time. As of now, you are no longer required to perform work on Amazon's behalf, and will receive your full pay and benefits (as applicable) for the next 90 days. During this transition period, you'll continue to have access to internal email, Chime, and A to Z on your personal device, and our primary mode of communication with you will be through email. If you have not yet downloaded the A to Z app … you'll need it to access important resources like MyHR, where you'll see FAQs about supportive resources, benefits, pay, how to retrieve any personal belongings from your workspace, and how to return your Amazon-issued equipment. You can find additional information about how to install A to Z, access MyHR, and access Chime and email on this page. Please ensure your personal email address is up to date in A to Z, and keep your Yubikey so you can access internal email on a personal computer/mobile device. Remember that caring team members are ready to assist you 24/7 through MyHR or the Employee Assistance Portal (EAP), offering free and confidential support, both within the A to Z App. If you run into any trouble at all getting what you need-whether that's connectivity issues, questions about next steps, or any other concerns-please just reply to this email. I'm personally committed to making sure you get the help you need as you navigate this change. Thank you,Beth GalettiSVP, People Experience & Technology Have a tip?

ByCaroline Castrillon, Senior Contributor. The dreaded email arrives unexpectedly. Or maybe you saw it coming for weeks. With Amazon cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, Target announcing layoffs and similar headlines across industries, this reality is hitting professionals everywhere. Being laid off feels unsettling at best. But here's what many successful professionals have discovered: a layoff can be the catalyst for a career change that propels you toward work you actually love, rather than one you simply tolerate. The key is resilience—the ability to transform adversity into opportunity. Here are five strategic ways to transform a layoff into a launchpad for your next chapter. Before you frantically update your resume and start applying to similar positions, take a breath. This moment of disruption is your opportunity to examine whether you've been on the right path. Many professionals spend years climbing a ladder only to realize it's been leading them away from what matters most. Start by asking yourself difficult questions: Sometimes we convince ourselves we're satisfied because the salary is competitive or the title is impressive, but a layoff strips away those justifications. Understanding your true preferences is crucial for identifying career paths that will actually suit you. Action Step: Create a spreadsheet listing every significant responsibility as "Energizing," "Neutral," or "Draining," then research careers that maximize the energizing elements. Once you've identified your target direction, you'll likely discover a gap between your current capabilities and the requirements of your desired role. Closing that gap requires strategic investment. If you received a severance package, you have a unique opportunity. The conservative approach is to save every dollar for basic expenses while searching for a similar job. Instead, strategically invest a portion of that severance in acquiring the skills, credentials or knowledge that will fund a career change. You don't need to be reckless. Even if you have a modest cushion, consider allocating 10% to 20% of your severance toward professional development that aligns with your newly identified career goals. Strategic investments might include: Action Step: Create a budget covering six to 12 months of expenses, then allocate $1,000 to $5,000 to career transition resources. Enroll in at least one high-quality course within two weeks. One of the biggest mistakes professionals make during a career change is relying on their old personal brand. Your resume and LinkedIn profile still emphasize expertise in the industry you're leaving behind. Successful career changers understand that you're reframing your existing experience through the lens of your new career. For example, the project management skills you developed in healthcare operations are absolutely relevant to program management in tech. The client relationship expertise you built in financial services translates directly to customer success roles in SaaS companies. Here's how to rebrand yourself effectively: Action Step: Overhaul your LinkedIn profile and resume to reflect your career transition. Create and publish at least one piece of content that demonstrates your enthusiasm for your new field. The traditional career change model involves leaving one full-time job and finding another full-time job in a different field. But this approach is risky, often slow and leaves no room for experimentation. You're either in your old career or your new one, with no middle ground. A more flexible approach is building a portfolio career or launching a side hustle that allows you to test and develop your new direction while maintaining some income security. This might mean taking on freelance projects in your target field, starting a consulting practice or creating a small business that aligns with your interests and skills. This approach offers multiple advantages: Action Step: Identify three ways you could generate income in your target field within 30 days through freelance platforms, consulting opportunities or contract roles. Secure at least one paid engagement within the next month. The most important shift you can make is psychological. How you tell the story of your layoff, to yourself and others, will significantly impact your career change success. If you frame yourself as a victim, you'll approach your job search from a position of weakness. If you frame yourself as the architect of an intentional career change, you'll project confidence and purpose. Practice articulating your story in a way that's honest but empowering. When networking contacts or interviewers ask about your situation, you might say: "I was affected by layoffs at [Company], which gave me the opportunity to reassess my career direction. I realized I wanted to focus more on [new field] because [compelling reason]. I've been investing in developing [relevant skills] and I'm excited about bringing my background in [previous field] to this new challenge." This narrative: Action Step: Write out your career transition story in 150-200 words and practice delivering it until it feels natural. Identify 10 people in your network who might have connections to your target field and reach out with your new narrative. Being laid off is undeniably difficult. It disrupts your routine, challenges your identity and creates financial uncertainty. But it also creates a forced pause that allows you to reconsider your professional trajectory without a steady paycheck keeping you on autopilot. The professionals who thrive after a layoff resist the urge to immediately recreate what they had before and instead use this disruption as a catalyst for intentional career change. Your layoff doesn't define you—but how you respond to it will. The question isn't whether you'll recover, but whether you'll use this moment to create something better than what you had before.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon is making layoffs at Audible as part of wider plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, Business Insider has learned. Bob Carrigan, the CEO of Audible, told employees in a Tuesday email, which was seen by Business Insider, that affected workers have been notified and additional organizational changes would follow. Those changes would "add focus and speed" to the audiobook and podcast division's most critical growth areas, he said. Carrigan added that Audible is "laser-focused on making sure we are organized and resourced for continued strength in the years ahead." The number of affected roles at Audible could not be learned. Amazon declined to comment, referring Business Insider to a Tuesday blog post from Beth Galetti, the company's senior vice president of people experience and technology, announcing the sweeping cuts. Get caught up on the Amazon layoffs: The post outlined how Amazon is aiming to be leaner against the backdrop of AI, which she described as the "most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet."Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that Amazon's workforce would shrink as a result of AI-driven efficiency gains. The company cut jobs in its cloud division, Amazon Web Services, in July after it froze its hiring budget for the retail unit. In January 2024, Audible reduced its workforce by 5%. Amazon acquired Audible for roughly $300 million in 2008.Read the full memo below. Jump to

Title: Amazon lays off thousands of corporate workers as it spends big on AI

Alina Selyukh Two Amazon employees talk at one of the entrances to the company's East Coast headquarters in Virginia. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Amazon is laying off thousands of corporate workers in an effort to slim down while it spends big on the AI race. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon human-resources executive Beth Galetti said the tech giant would cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, or about 4% of its workforce. She cited a goal of "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs." Amazon has faced intense pressure from investors to tighten its finances. The company had ballooned its workforce, including in corporate jobs, during the pandemic. And Amazon in July reported disappointing gains in its AI business; it's a dominant cloud-computing giant, but its growth in AI is lagging behind Microsoft and other rivals. Amazon will deliver its latest financial report on Thursday. Last week, its AWS cloud service suffered one of the worst outages in its history, disrupting the work of numerous popular websites and apps, including Venmo, Reddit, Roblox and Duolingo. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in June wrote to employees about his thoughts on generative AI, saying: "We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company." News reports, citing company insiders, previously suggested layoffs could affect as many as 30,000 corporate jobs across human resources, cloud computing and many other divisions. Amazon's corporate layoffs come on the heels of nearly 2,000 corporate job cuts at Starbucks as part of the coffee-chain's turnaround plan, prompted by declining sales. Last week, Target also said it would cut 1,800 jobs from its corporate headcount, as it tries to right the ship with sales down or flat for almost three years.

Title: Consumer confidence dips modestly with concerns about the future

By MATT OTT, Associated Press Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer confidence weakened slightly in October as Americans remain anxious about their future financial prospects. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell by 1 point to 94.6 in October from an upwardly revised September reading of 95.6. Economists were expecting the reading to come in unchanged from the previous month. One year ago, the reading was 109.5. A measure of Americans’ short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market dipped by 2.9 points to 71.5, remaining well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. However, consumers’ assessments of their current economic situation rose 1.8 points to 129.3. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers’ biggest concern. Mentions of tariffs declined again this month but remain elevated, the Conference Board said. Last week, government data showed that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in September as gas prices jumped while the cost of rents cooled, painting a mixed picture for consumers. While the economy is still growing steadily, hiring remains slow and more high-profile companies have recently announced layoffs. Consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August. The report on the consumer price index was issued more than a week late because of the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they will cut their key interest rate at their meeting Wednesday. It would be the second time this year even though inflation is above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited increasing concerns about the U.S. labor market, which, while broadly healthy by historical standards, is showing signs of deterioration this year. Responses to the Conference Board’s latest survey revealed that while respondents were slightly more positive about current job market, they are growing more concerned about their future employment prospects. The most recent government jobs report showed that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July’s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. The government did not issue its September jobs report due to the shutdown. In addition to the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023, economists say the recent hiring slump may also be a result of Trump’s policies, including his sweeping and ever-changing tariffs on imports, a crackdown on illegal immigration and purges of the federal workforce. Many companies have been locked in a “no hire, no fire” position, fearful of expanding payrolls until the effects of Trump’s tariffs are more clear. But in the past two weeks, there have been notable exceptions from major U.S. corporations. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while trimming costs elsewhere. Last week, Target said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions. Also last week, Meta Platforms said it was cutting roughly 600 positions and in September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores while laying off 900 nonretail employees. Survey respondents who said they intended to buy a new or used car in the near future rose. While the share of those saying they planned to purchase a home declined slightly this month, the broader six-month trend is still rising, the Conference Board said. Plans to buy big-ticket items like appliances was little changed from September.

Amazon announced this morning that it was eliminating approximately 14,000 corporate jobs as part of organizational changes to “be organized more leanly.” A previous report from Reuters suggested that the company could lay off up to 30,000 employees, but Amazon said today that it will reduce its workforce in some areas and hire in others. As you may remember, Amazon previously laid off about 27,000 employees at the beginning of 2023. In June of this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a message to employees that the rise of generative and agentic AI would significantly impact how the company operates. “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” the exec said at the time. Today, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, confirmed the disruptive effect of AI technology on the tech industry. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” the exec said. As Bloomberg pointed out today, these 14,000 job cuts represent around 4% of the company’s 350,000 corporate jobs. Amazon said in June that it had approximately 1.55 million employees around the world, with most of them working in warehouses. Galetti said today that Amazon will “get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” The company will give most employees affected by the layoffs 90 days to look for a new role internally. The retail giant will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to everyone else. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Michelle Chapman, Associated Press Michelle Chapman, Associated Press Leave your feedback Amazon will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs as the online retail giant ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. In June CEO Andy Jassy, who has aggressively sought to cut costs since becoming CEO in 2021, said that he anticipated generative AI would reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce in the next few years. READ MORE: Amazon to pay $2.5 billion to settle FTC allegations it duped customers into enrolling in Prime Jassy said at the time that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but that figure was a “small fraction” of what it plans to build. Jassy encouraged employees to get on board with the company’s AI plans after it announced plans to invest $10 billion building a campus in North Carolina to expand its cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it builds up its infrastructure to tries to keep up with other tech giants making leaps in AI. Amazon is competing with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta and others. In a conference call with industry analysts in May, Jassy said the potential for growth in the company’s AWS business is massive. “If you believe your mission is to make customers’ lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you’re going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that’s what we’re doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we’re building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+,” he said. Teams and individuals impacted by the job cuts will be notified on Tuesday. Most workers will be given 90 days to look for a new position internally, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, wrote in a letter to employees on Tuesday. Those who can’t find a new role at the company or who opt not to look for one will be provided transitional support including severance pay, outplacement services and health insurance benefits. Amazon has about 350,000 corporate employees and a total workforce of approximately 1.56 million. The cuts announced Tuesday amount to about a 4% reduction in its corporate workforce. Amazon’s workforce doubled during the pandemic as millions stayed home and boosted online spending. In the following years, big tech and retail companies cut thousands of jobs to bring spending back in line. The cuts announced Tuesday suggests Amazon is still trying to get the size of its workforce right and it may not be over. It was the biggest culling at Amazon since 2023, when the company cut 27,000 jobs. Those cuts came in waves, with 9,000 jobs trimmed in March of that year, and another 18,000 employees two months later. Amazon has not said if more job cuts are on the way. Yet the jobs market which has for years been an pillar in the U.S. economy, is showing signs of weakening. Layoffs have been limited, but the same can be said for hiring. Government hiring data is on hold during during the government shutdown, but earlier this month a survey by payroll company ADP showed a surprising loss of 32,000 jobs losses in the private sector in September. Many retailers are pulling back on seasonal hiring this year due to uncertainty over the U.S. economy and tariffs. Amazon Inc. said this month, however, that it would hire 250,000 seasonal workers, the same as last year’s holiday season. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that the layoffs “represent a deep cleaning of Amazon’s corporate workforce.” “Unlike the Target layoffs, Amazon is operating from a position of strength,” he said. “The company has been producing good growth, and it still has a lot of headroom for further expansion in both the U.S. and overseas.” But Saunders noted that Amazon is not immune to outside factors, as global markets tighten and underlying costs climb. “It needs to act if it wants to continue with a good bottom line performance. This is especially so given the amount of investment the company is making in areas like logistics and AI. In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure,” he said. Amazon will post quarterly financial results on Thursday. During its most recent quarter, the company reported 17.5% growth for its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

PHOTO: KARSTEN MORAN/NYTIMES Krist Boo Published Oct 28, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Oct 29, 2025, 07:03 PM SINGAPORE – Tech giant Amazon is axing 14,000 corporate jobs across its global offices from Oct 28, and industry observers say Singapore may not be spared. An internal memo from the senior vice-president overseeing human resources Beth Galetti announced the cuts, following a news break from Reuters on the same day citing 30,000 jobs. citing 30,000 jobs In a letter to her colleagues, which was made public, Ms Galetti said the firm is offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, as well as offers of severance pay, outplacement services, and health insurance benefits to those retrenched. She explained that the layoffs are part of the firm’s ongoing efforts to cut bureaucracy and reporting layers, and shift resources to its “biggest bets”, which she did not specify. An Amazon spokesperson for the region did not answer a query on whether the job cuts extended to Singapore, but referred The Straits Times to Ms Galetti’s memo. More than 7,000 workers were laid off in Singapore in the first six months of 2025, according to official numbers. Firings came from tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and TikTok, and others across banking, energy, media and manufacturing. More than 7,000 workers were laid off in Singapore Seattle-based Amazon has over 2,500 employees across cloud, corporate, retail, technology and operations functions in Singapore, which is also its Asia-Pacific headquarters. Ms Galetti added that the company would continue, in 2026, to hire in key strategic areas while continuing job cuts, as chief executive Andy Jassy had said earlier this year. In 2024, Amazon made US$638 billion (S$826 billion) in revenues and over US$68 billion in operating profits, with 1.55 million employees on its payroll. Explaining the firings despite the firm being profitable, Ms Galetti said: “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before… “We need to be organised more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Amazon has, along with other tech giants, engaged in rounds of firings since late 2022. It is estimated that it removed 27,000 roles added in frenzied hiring sprees during the pandemic, when consumer demand for tech services surged and tech talent was short. Amazon is scheduled to report its latest third-quarter earnings on Oct 30. While Amazon is not a unionised company in Singapore, some of its workers are members of the Tech Talent Assembly (TTAB), an association affiliated with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). In response to ST’s queries, a TTAB spokesperson said on Oct 29 that the association is proactively reaching out to its members to offer help if needed. The spokesperson added that TTAB works closely with NTUC PME and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to offer career transition guidance and job matching services. Affected members are encouraged to contact TTAB for assistance by writing to ttab@ntuc.org.sg. ttab@ntuc.org.sg E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Amazon said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy, remove layers, and invest more in its AI strategy. This marks the e-commerce giant’s second-largest job cuts since it slashed 22,000 jobs in 2022. Amazon had nearly 1.2 million employees as of October 31, 2024, of which more than 360,000 were in its corporate division, in administrative, sales, and executive roles. In a memo shared with employees, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote that the move is aimed at making the company “even stronger” by shifting resources to invest in its “biggest bets.” Galetti acknowledged that the decision would be questioned in light of the company’s good performance, but argued that the layoffs are necessary because the “world is changing quickly.” “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted [sic] that we need to be organized more leanly [sic], with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she wrote. The layoffs come at a time when Amazon is investing heavily in tech infrastructure to build more compute capacity for offering AI services. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to staff that the company would need fewer employees as it continues to roll out more AI agents. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” That focus is clearly visible if you consider the company’s expenditure on tech infrastructure. Amazon said it had spent $55.6 billion in the first half of its current financial year primarily on tech infrastructure to support the growth of its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, according to its quarterly report. The company’s revenue increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter compared to a year earlier. AWS accounted for 18% of total net sales. Reuters reported on Monday that the company was planning to slash up to 30,000 jobs across human resources, devices and services, operations, and other departments. The company has made smaller job cuts across different divisions. In January, Amazon reduced a small number of positions in its Communications and Sustainability departments. Amazon said it is offering most affected employees 90 days to look for a new role internally, and its recruiters would prioritize internal candidates for new roles within the company. It will also offer severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more to those who can’t move internally. Galetti wrote that in 2026, the company would continue to remove layers and “realize efficiency gains” while hiring in key areas. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Amazon to Cut 14,000 Jobs to Meet ‘This Generation of AI’

The company hinted AI-induced layoffs were on the horizon in June Amazon is laying off roughly 14,000 people across the company as it grapples with “this generation of AI,” it told employees on Tuesday. In a note to staffers, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, said the company’s business results were strong and it would continue hiring in areas where Amazon plans to expand. But despite such strong performance, she said the company needed to move faster to keep up with AI. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” The impending cuts are notably less than an initially reported figure of 30,000, but more could still follow into 2026. It is unclear which divisions of the wide-reaching Amazon will be impacted, though Galetti said the roles would be spread throughout its workforce. Amazon currently has about 1.55 million employees. Many staffers will be given 90 days to find a new role within Amazon, while others will be given a severance and benefits package, Galetti further noted. “The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs,” she wrote. Such layoffs were hinted at in a June memo by CEO Andy Jassy, one of several tech CEOs who’ve predicted AI will constrict the current job market as roles are repurposed to accommodate its use. “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy wrote at the time. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Again, the layoffs may not be over yet. The company has plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots in the coming years, believing it can leverage new technology to avoid filling hundreds of thousands of roles, according to the New York Times. Tuesday’s layoffs follow other cuts at corporate behemoths, driven by both economic headwinds and AI adoption. Target said on Thursday it planned to cut 1,800 jobs, 1,000 of which are pure layoffs, while Microsoft, Meta and Google have all shed between hundreds and thousands of employees this year. Paramount Skydance is also expected to initiate its first round of cuts —roughly 1,000 jobs — on Wednesday.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

Hollywood Life Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News NewsExpand Menu EntertainmentExpand Menu BeautyExpand Menu FashionExpand Menu ShoppingExpand Menu TrendingExpand Menu Celebrity BiosExpand Menu Amazon discussed artificial intelligence in its announcement about the company-wide layoffs. Find out what jobs are being cut and why. News Amazon confirmed its company-wide layoffs in a statement on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, citing artificial intelligence and the need for “fewer layers” in the business. The announcement came months after Amazon announced a five-day return-to-office requirement. However, the company’s latest statement vowed that its “reductions” are Amazon’s path to “get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” The layoffs are coming right on the heels of the widespread Amazon Web Services outage that impacted banks, airlines and multiple online platforms earlier this month. Below, find out which jobs are being cut and why. About 14,000 jobs are being cut at Amazon, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon Beth Galetti announced on October 28, 2025. However, Reuters reported that the figure is actually higher, with about 30,000 jobs going down. The outlet cited three sources familiar with the situation. According to Galetti’s announcement, Amazon is offering “most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and [its] recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon.” Amazon is reportedly planning to cut up to 14,000 corporate jobs, its largest round of layoffs since 2022, impacting about 10% of its corporate workforce. @RebeccaJarvis reports. pic.twitter.com/r9bt7ZSm4E — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 28, 2025 For those unable to land another role at the company, Galetti said Amazon will offer “transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits and more.” Although Amazon’s statement on the layoffs did not specify which job titles are being cut, multiple corporate areas were already announced to be in the process of layoffs earlier the year. Per CNBC, jobs in sales operations, marketing and global service organizations in the Amazon Web Services cloud unit were being eliminated. Additionally, roles in Human Resources were also reportedly being cut or were at risk of being eliminated. Galetti said that the job cuts are happening because “the world is changing quickly” and “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).” She further explained that Amazon intends to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect

Cuts represent 4% of ecommerce giant's white-collar workforce By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Amazon said it will cut approximately 14,000 white-collar jobs, representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, as it seeks to gain efficiencies — and as it prepares for advances in artificial intelligence that will reduce the number of humans needed to run the company. Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees Tuesday that the layoffs are a continuation of the company’s efforts “to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Related Stories Morocco Set as 2026 European Film Market Country in Focus Best Friend Forever Lands World Sales, Gebeka Nabs French Rights for ‘Papaya,’ Supervised by Oscar-Nominated Alê Abreu (EXCLUSIVE) On Monday, Reuters had reported that Amazon would cut as many as 30,000 employees to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” In her memo, Galetti indicated that the company anticipates making more layoffs next year. Popular on Variety This past June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telegraphed looming layoffs, saying that efficiency gains from using AI would cause the company to reduce its corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he wrote in an internal memo. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Galetti wrote in her memo Tuesday that “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well.” For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported revenue of $167.7 billion (up 13%) and net income of $18.2 billion (up 35%), with both metrics comfortably topping Wall Street estimates. The ecommerce giant held $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the end of June. According to Galetti, “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” In 2026, Galetti wrote, “as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains.” Amazon is scheduled to report Q3 2025 earnings Thursday, Oct. 30, after the market closes.

Title: From Amazon to Microsoft, tech layoffs to affect over 80,000 amid AI-led restructuring

E-commerce giant Amazon on 28 October said that it is laying off 14,000 employees as it seeks to reduce bureaucracy and increase investment in artificial intelligence (AI), according to reports. Overall, amid news of layoffs at multiple tech companies, at least 81,445 jobs have been directly impacted due to AI-led restructuring. Amazon, in an official statement, called the job cuts a “continuation” to strengthen operations by “further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs”, AFP reported. Earlier today, Reuters and Fortune cited sources to report that the retail and tech company would fire a total of 30,000 corporate employees globally — its largest layoffs since late 2022, when it cut 27,000 roles. Amazon employs around 15 lakh people overall, of which 3.5 lakh are corporate employees. The statement, signed by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, read: “While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles.” Galetti added that AI is the “most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet”, adding that “it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before”, the AFP report added. “Looking ahead to 2026, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realise efficiency gains,” she stated. Notably, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been vocal about AI adoption, stating that those who fail to adapt would be left behind. In June, in a company memo, he wrote, “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” Amazon is joining the ranks of big tech that have, in recent months, shaved staffing strength as increased investment in AI reshapes the industry. Overall, at least 81,445 jobs have been directly impacted due to AI-led restructuring.
