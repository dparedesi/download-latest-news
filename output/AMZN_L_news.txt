Title: Report: Microsoft tying to move towards AI agents amid mass layoffs

Microsoft is going through another round of mass layoffs with 9,000 employees in various divisions being let go. While the management has called these layoffs organizational changes, a new report citing a developer with knowledge of the situation claims that Microsoft is looking to replace its human workforce with AI. Speaking at Meta’s inaugural LlamaCon AI developer event in May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had shared that about 30% of the company’s code is written by AI. Now, it looks like the company is going full steam ahead with AI integration and this could have something to do with the recent mass layoffs. A report by Engadget citing a developer at Microsoft who also received the memo from Phil Spencer, but supposedly was not let go, shared that management is “trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents." While the report does not elaborate on this claim, the memo stated “increase agility and effectiveness” as one of the reasons for the layoffs. If implemented correctly, AI agents can significantly optimize various workflows so the developer’s claim of Microsoft trying to replace human workers with AI agents surely has weight to it. This has become an industry trend as even Amazon had recently issued a memo to its employees stating that AI agents will replace some human jobs. Furthermore, the developer also shared his anger about the memo and the current situation of development at Microsoft. “I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about,” the developer reportedly told Engadget. They added that employees at Microsoft are not happy about the quality of the product and that a lot of pep talk is being used to try and up the morale. It should be noted that Microsoft has not associated AI agents with the mass layoffs but considering the AI-written code, using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and other AI related internal implementations, AI agents seem to be the end goal for the company.

Title: Microsoft is laying off 9,000 employees in its latest huge job cut

Microsoft is cutting more jobs as it continues AI push When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is cutting 9,000 jobs with most of those facing the ax being employed in the Gaming division. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said (via CNBC). The job cuts seek to reduce the layers of managers standing between individual contributors and top executives, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. Cutting jobs seems to be the growing trend for many large companies, with Microsoft cutting just under 1% of its workforce in January 2025. Another 6,000 workers, mostly programmers, were cut in May and a further 300 jobs cut in June. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo, “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.” Amazon has also gone through several waves of layoffs this year, with CEO Andy Jassy repeatedly saying that AI could replace some of its workers.

For Microsoft though, the layoffs are more to do with improving business performance and reducing internal friction. Intel has also lined up a significant wave of layoffs, with the company looking to cut 15-20% of its factory workforce. Intel already laid off 15,000 people in August 2024. But while Intel has been struggling with declining revenues and market performance, Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter.

Title: CEOs have a new AI flex
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/03/ceo-have-a-new-ai-flex/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T09:19:57Z
Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Good morning. If you’re in the habit of listening to CEOs, you’ll notice a new trend among leaders talking about AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent interview that AI now does up to 50% of all work at the company, in key functions like engineering, coding, and customer support. In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said 20% to 30% of the tech giant’s code is now written by AI coding assistants. And in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said over 30% of code at Google is now generated by AI. It’s the latest CEO flex: Citing numbers showing that AI is doing heavy lifting internally. The move presents the company as being ahead of the AI curve and invariably grabs the attention of people who matter. Investors hear the magic words that the business is on track to save money—presumably accomplished—but rarely explicitly stated, through future job cuts. It also signals to clients of the Big Tech companies making the pronouncements that they should open their wallets, pronto, to incorporate more AI into their operations, or risk falling behind. But how significant these CEO flexes ultimately are from Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft is difficult to know. The metrics cited seem precise, yet when asked, their spokespeople declined to provide any details about how the numbers were calculated or how they defined the work that they claim AI has done. “The truth is, we don’t yet have a common framework for measuring what ‘percent of work’ really means in the age of AI,” said Malvika Jethmalani, founder of human capital advisory firm Atvis Group, in a message to Fortune. “Are we counting lines of code, tasks completed, hours saved, or business outcomes influenced?” But Netherlands-based occupational psychologist Marais Bester thinks something else is afoot. “I think it’s also sort of an indicator to employees, saying, you better watch your back, you better perform.” From a business psychology standpoint, that’s not an indicator of good leadership, he added. Shonna Waters, an organizational psychologist and CEO of advisory firm Fractional Insights, thinks the companies that will succeed are those with “structural empathy”—that is, building systems that bring in frontline worker voices. “At the end of the day, you need the humans to still be the ones actually adopting the AI, you need to bring them along with your journey and figure out how to do it in concert with them, as opposed to something you’re doing to them.” You can read my full story for Fortune here. — Sharon Goldman More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill advances to final vote The debate went late into the night but expect the House to vote on the whole thing today. The president has not been happy with Congress’s delays. Axios has an interesting list of weird stuff that is in the gigantic act. FHFA head asks Congress to investigate Fed’s Powell Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, published a letter on X accusing U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of giving deceptive testimony to Congress and demanding an investigation. President Trump then piled on with his own post calling for Powell to “resign immediately.” Reality check: Pulte did not provide specifics about what he believes Powell said wrongly. This is yet another extraordinary chapter in the book of Trump’s political tirades against his top central banker. Powell appears to have earned the president’s dislike simply because he has set monetary policy independently of the desires of the White House. CEOs are now openly saying AI will cut jobs The chief executives of Ford, Google, Amazon, Anthropic, and JPMorgan Chase have all openly stated that white-collar jobs will go into decline. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has said the company won’t hire new workers unless it can be proved that AI cannot do the job. Layoffs at Microsoft Microsoft is cutting around 9,000 jobs—almost 4% of its global workforce—in an effort to streamline operations and continue restructuring efforts. This is the biggest round of layoffs Microsoft has had since 2023. ADP says jobs declined The private sector is shrinking and lost 33,000 jobs last month, per a new report from ADP. “Though layoffs continue to be rare,” said ADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson, “a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month.” Vietnam strikes trade deal with the U.S. The U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the U.S. and goods that have been “transshipped” through Vietnam will face a 40% tax. Scaramucci’s second act Eight years after his disastrous 11-day stint as White House spokesperson, Anthony Scaramucci has remade his life as one of the most influential podcasters in politics and finance via his ability to read the room and draw together some of the world’s most powerful and influential people. Apple alleges former employee stole trade secrets Apple is suing a former senior product design engineer for allegedly stealing files with proprietary information about the $3,500 Vision Pro headset before leaving the company. Plus, Apple alleges that their former employee “was not honest about his stated reason for leaving Apple,” as his next job was at competitor Snap Inc. Goldman Sachs on employment: “We estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 85k in June, below consensus of 110k and the three-month average of +135k. On the positive side, the end of worker strikes will provide a 6k boost. On the negative side, big data indicators were soft, we estimate the termination of Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350k Venezuelan migrants in mid-May will impose a 25k drag, and we expect a 15k decline in federal government payrolls. We estimate that the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3% on a rounded basis,” per Jan Hatzius et al. ‘Massive’ investment in R&D leads China’s Honor to launch world’s thinnest foldable phone by Nicholas Gordon Melinda French Gates tells Oprah Winfrey she runs every major life decision by her three closest female friends: ‘They are my truth council’ by Alexa Mikhail Andy Jassy’s latest canvas for reinvigorating Amazon’s cultural DNA?

Title: Microsoft Cuts 9,000 Jobs, Cancels Xbox Games Including Perfect Dark Reboot

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Microsoft is cutting jobs once again. After laying off some employees in the gaming division in January and around 6,000 employees across various verticals in May, the company on Wednesday confirmed to The Seattle Times that it is reducing its workforce once again by almost 4%. The latest round of layoffs is part of “organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Gizmodo. Microsoft hasn’t confirmed which departments are affected or how many employees have been let go. The Redmond-based company had 228,000 employees as of June 2024. After reducing the recent job cuts, 4% of the workforce would translate to nearly 9,000 employees. Gaming is among the departments that have taken a major hit. “To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,” Xbox leader Phil Spencer writes in a memo to employees, viewed by IGN. Those affected will be contacted by HR and be provided with severance benefits as required by local laws, including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, Spencer notes. Those eliminated from Xbox can apply for open roles across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority, he adds. Following Spencer’s statement, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty confirmed to employees that it would be cancelling the development of games like Everwild, Perfect Dark, and several other announced projects. These developments follow a Bloomberg report from last month that said thousands of Microsoft jobs would be cut after the end of the fiscal year in June. That report suggested marketing and sales teams could take the biggest hit; however, the latest reports indicate gaming has been affected more than other departments. We have reached out to Microsoft for further clarification regarding the departments affected and the number of workers let go. The months and years ahead may continue to be tough for tech employees. Intel is planning to lay off 15-20% of its factory workforce amid financial struggles, while Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has already warned employees that AI agents will replace a considerable number of jobs at the online retailer in the next few years.

AI's disruption of cognitive roles mirrors the Industrial Revolution's impact, accelerating faster. Banks aim to balance human-AI collaboration, but the workforce will look fundamentally different as "bots join payroll." The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) has quietly ushered in a new era of workplace automation, deploying "digital employees" powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These digital employees are equipped with their own credentials such as company logins, just like their human counterparts. They also operate autonomouslyÂ âÂ validating transactions, identifying software vulnerabilities and communicating with human managers, all without direct oversight. BNY Chief InformationÂ Officer (CIO) Leigh-Ann Russell said BNY Mellon's initial two AI personas were developed in just three months, and were assigned to specific teams to restrict data access. One was designed to handle coding duties, and the other was assigned to do payment validation. Soon, they will gain email and Microsoft Teams accounts â blurring the line between human and machine collaboration. "This is the next level," Russell told the Wall Street Journal. "In six months, it will become very, very prevalent." Goldman Sachs has similarly rolled out an AI assistant to 10,000 bankers and traders, with plans to expand firmwide by year's end. Dubbed "GS AI Assistant," the tool proofreads documents, translates code and may soon execute multi-step tasks like a seasoned employee. Goldman Sachs CIO Marco Argenti envisions AI evolving to "reason" like a company veteran, generating solutions without explicit instructions. "People are going to be the ones that evolve the AI," he told CNBC, downplaying fears of mass layoffs. Yet, Bloomberg estimates up to 200,000 finance jobs could vanish by 2028 as AI handles middle-office functions. (Related:Â Bill Gates predicts AI will replace humans in most roles within a decade.) How AI "colleagues" are redefining finance jobs Meanwhile, JPMorgan is navigating how much autonomy to grant AI. While the company's Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron said defining access levels remains a case-by-case challenge, he predicts every employee will eventually have an AI counterpart. Already, 230,000 JPMorgan staff use an internal chatbot â hinting at a future where AI concierges manage client interactions. The use of AI by the world's top three investment banksÂ signals a seismic shift in how financial institutions operate. Historically, automation began replacing manual labor a long time ago: textile workers in the 19th century, factory assemblers in the 20th. Today's AI upheaval targets cognitive roles, mirroring the Industrial Revolution's disruption but accelerating faster. According to Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services, the finance industry is grappling with a fundamental question: "How do we coordinate [human and digital workers] together?" As banks test these uncharted waters, the implications stretch beyond efficiency. If AI can validate payments or draft legal documents with near-human judgment, the very nature of employment and who or what qualifies as a "colleague" may need redefinition. For now, BNY Mellon insists it will keep hiring humans. But with digital employees logging in alongside them, Wall Street's future workforce may look utterly unlike its past.

Title: Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 jobs as it invests in AI
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl0w1w394o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D

Microsoft has confirmed that it will lay off as many as 9,000 workers, in the technology giant's latest wave of job cuts this year. The company said several divisions would be affected without specifying which ones but reports suggest that its Xbox video gaming unit will be hit. Microsoft has set out plans to invest heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), and is spending $80bn (£68.6bn) in huge data centres to train AI models. A spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The cuts would equate to 4% of Microsoft's 228,000-strong global workforce. Some video game projects have reportedly been affected by them. According to an internal email seen by The Verge and gaming publication IGN, Microsoft has told gaming staff that the planned reboot of first-person shooter series Perfect Dark, along with another title, Everwild, will be cancelled. The Initiative, a Microsoft-owned studio behind the Perfect Dark reboot, will also be shut down, the memo stated. Job cuts have also affected staff across wider studios owned by Microsoft, including Forza Motorsport maker Turn 10 and Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, according to employee posts on social media seen by the BBC. Matt Firor, studio director of ZeniMax Online Studios, announced on Wednesday he would be leaving his position in July after more than 18 years at the studio. "While I won't be working on the game anymore, I will be cheering you on and adding to the thousands of hours I've already spent in-game," said a post attributed to Mr Firor by ZeniMax on X. Romero Games Ltd, an independent studio based in Galway, Ireland - co-founded by Doom developer John Romero - has also cut staff after funding for its game was axed by its publisher. "These people are the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected," said Mr Romero in a post on X. Microsoft has initiated three other rounds of redundancies so far in 2025, including in May when it said it would cut 6,000 roles. An official database maintained by Washington state shows that more than 800 of the positions eliminated will be concentrated in the city of Redmond as well as in Bellevue, another Microsoft hub in its home state. In recent years, like many other big technology firms, Microsoft has refocussed its business towards developing AI, including investing in data centres and chips. Last year, the company hired British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman to lead its new Microsoft AI division. A top Microsoft executive recently told the BBC that the next half century will "fundamentally be defined by artificial intelligence,", changing the way we work and interact with one another. Microsoft is also a major investor and shareholder in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, although the relationship has reportedly grown tense in recent months. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft has struggled to sell its AI assistant, known as Copilot, to business customers because many office workers prefer ChatGPT. The layoffs among rank and file workers at Microsoft come as major US tech companies court top AI talent. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has been poaching talent from rivals to form a 'superintelligence' lab. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally involved in recruitment. OpenAI boss Sam Altman said recently that members of his team had been getting offers of more than $100m (£74.3m) as "signing bonuses" from Meta. Last month, Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he expected AI would replace some of his firm's workers.

Title: Analysis shows Trump's tariffs would cost U.S. employers $82.3 billion

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. Travel like a local with Nomad eSIM!

If businesses are paying more in Tariffs it’s going to cost the private sector more. Remember that Republicans have no principles and that the “low tax” hill they pretend to stand on means nothing as soon as daddy Trump says otherwise Hard to put a number on it or project costs, since things change daily. It’s hard to find patterns in chaos. It's time for our MAGA-friends to admit what everyone else knows...Trump hasn't a clue... Whether is just his life-long stupidity or his clear dive into dementia, he and his cabal of kooks, felons, and grifters are ruining all that is good in America... Most critically, our Constitution and democracy.... Cue MAGA tying themselves into knots trying to defend their cult leader at every turn. Tariffs accomplish several key objectives. First, reshoring of manufacturing and supply chains to US, increasing US national security and jobs. Second, opens up new markets, case in point the trade agreement just announced with Vietnam. Turns out countries and companies want to avoid tariffs and can easily do so by opening up their markets and/or reshoring production to the US etc. Above, WHY US now has RECORD Private CAPEX investment, not wasteful Govt. spending, and maybe the best leading indicator of future economic growth. It's worth noting, that the US Govt. tariff revenues in just April and May were nearly 90 $Billion, up about 5x from the same two months in 2024. Seems Trump's making Uncle Sam Rich Again! But as companies reshore to the US, the tariffs drop to 0% and of course if countries open up their markets, then Trump drops US tariffs accordingly. ChatGPT didn’t tell you the trade deficit increased. ChatGPT didn’t tell you the trade deficit increased. Maybe the Financial Times Trump said his tariffs would not hurt Americans. Trump said his tariffs would not hurt Americans. He could have admitted that they would, and his base would still have voted for him. That's the entire republican mentality: I'll suffer, as long as they suffer more. “a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.” You can be sure it won’t be through lower profit margins. This is what you MAGA people voted for, is it? I trust you are still as happy as many of you here regularly claim to be. Trump hits consumers with tariffs, takes away their health care, takes away jobs, but asks those Americans to buy his overpriced cologne, bibles, shoes, coins, etc. https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/ahead-maga-defend-internet-lot-210411356.html Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Title: Something Just Broke: U.S. Employment Tanked In June, 744,308 Job Cuts Have Been Announced So Far This Year, And Retail Layoffs Are Up 255%

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What in the world just happened to the job market? The unexpectedly bad numbers that have just come in have truly been a shock to many of us. Yes, we knew that conditions were getting worse during the early stages of this year. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has publicly admitted that the labor market “deteriorated noticeably” during the first quarter of 2025. But now it is becoming clear that our economic slide is threatening to become an economic avalanche. The U.S. economy needs to add approximately 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. Unfortunately, the latest monthly report from ADP shows that the U.S. economy actually lost jobs last month. Private sector employment dropped by 33,000 in June, and that was the very first decline that we have witnessed since 2023… Private sector hiring shrunk dramatically last month in a worrying sign for the the US economy. Private payrolls shed 33,000 jobs in June, but analysts had expected them to add 100,000, the latest ADP figures revealed. The worrying data – the first decrease since 2023 – suggests the US economy could be a lot less resilient than investors have been hoping. There is no way to spin this to make it look good. The labor market has gotten much tighter, and large companies all over the nation are trimming their payrolls right now. In particular, service jobs are being axed at a very alarming rate… The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000. Financial activity roles also contributed to the month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance. Personally, I believe that the numbers that we get from ADP are far more accurate than the highly manipulated numbers that we get from the federal government. But I also believe that the most accurate picture of the labor market comes from the monthly report that is released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. According to the latest report, U.S. employers announced a total of 744,308 job cuts during the first half of this year. The last time that we saw a larger figure was during the early days of the pandemic in 2020… Layoffs across the U.S. this year have climbed to their highest level since the pandemic slammed the economy in 2020, new labor data shows. In the first half of 2025, companies announced 744,308 job cuts nationwide, the highest tally since the first six months of 2020, when employers cut nearly 1.6 million jobs in response to COVID-related disruptions, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2020, we could blame the lockdowns for the layoffs. But this time around, there are no lockdowns. Retailers are being hit particularly hard. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retail job cuts during the first half of 2025 were 255 percent higher than they were during the first half of 2024… Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024. “Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,” Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.” When I first started using the term “retail apocalypse”, a lot of people thought that I was exaggerating. Does anyone out there want to tell me that I am exaggerating now? Day after day, more big names go bankrupt. In fact, we just learned that Del Monte Foods has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy… Del Monte Foods kicked off efforts to pursue a sale as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US on Tuesday under an agreement with certain key lenders, the company said in a statement. The company has secured $912.5 million in financing to support itself through the proceedings, it said, adding that it intends to remain open and continue operations throughout the bankruptcy. The 139-year old company hosts names like canned fruits and vegetables brand Del Monte, College Inn, under which it sells broth and stocks, and tea brands like Joyba. I had no idea that they were in trouble. Of course even companies that are thriving are making cutbacks right now. On Wednesday, Microsoft confirmed that it will be laying off approximately 9,000 more workers… Microsoft is kicking off its fiscal year by laying off thousands of employees in the largest round of layoffs since 2023, the company confirmed Wednesday. In an ongoing effort to streamline its workforce, Microsoft said as much as 4%, or roughly 9,000, of the company’s employees could be affected by Wednesday’s layoffs. This latest round of layoffs comes in the aftermath of a round of layoffs in May and a round of layoffs in June… Wednesday’s move follows two waves of layoffs in May and June, which saw Microsoft fire more than 6,000 employees, almost 2,300 of whom were based in Washington. During May’s round of layoffs, Microsoft emphasized that it wanted to flatten management layers. But data from Washington state showed only about 17% of the cuts in Redmond were designated as managers. Why is Microsoft doing this? They are supposed to be one of our most successful companies. Speaking of successful tech companies, it is being reported that Amazon will be conducting “brutal workforce cuts”… Amazon’s CEO has announced brutal workforce cuts as the company increases its use of Artificial Intelligence. Amazon boss Andy Jassy said he plans to reduce the company’s corporate workforce over the next few years as AI will make certain roles redundant. Jassy told employees in a note seen by the Wall Street Journal that AI was a once-in-a-lifetime technological advancement and it has already transformed how Amazon operates. If our largest and most valuable companies are ruthlessly slashing workers, what does this say about our economy as a whole? Other corporate giants such as Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan are reducing workforce levels by offering buyouts to their employees… In the private sector, Google, UnitedHealthcare and Nissan, among others, have offered buyouts to U.S. workers this year. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. A couple of years ago, corporate America was engaged in a hiring frenzy. But now the environment has completely changed. We all need to brace ourselves for what is ahead, because it appears that things will get even more challenging during the months to come.

Title: Microsoft: We Need A Lot Less Employees. And a Lot More AI Infrastructure.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts 🚨 Microsoft's 2025 strategy in numbers: ❌ 15,300+ employees laid off (7% of workforce) YTD: •9,000 cuts announced July 2•6,000 cuts in May•300+ cuts in June•Performance cuts in January•and only halfway through year 💰 $80 billion invested in AI infrastructure 40%… pic.twitter.com/LJVfwStpW9 — Jason ✨👾SaaStr.Ai✨ Lemkin (@jasonlk) July 2, 2025 The tech giant’s massive workforce reductions coincide with record-breaking AI investments, signaling a fundamental shift in how Microsoft views its future workforce As the technology giant implements what amounts to its most aggressive workforce reduction campaign since 2014, eliminating approximately 15,300 employees across multiple rounds of cuts in just the first half of 2025 alone — while simultaneously committing $80 billion to AI infrastructure — the company is telegraphing a vision of the future where artificial intelligence increasingly replaces human labor. Microsoft is projecting 14%+ revenue growth this year, with up to 10% fewer employees: Microsoft’s 2025 workforce reductions have been extensive and systematic. The company announced in May that it would lay off about 6,000 people, followed by at least 300 more cuts in June, and most recently announced another 9,000 layoffs in July 2025. Combined with smaller performance-based cuts in January affecting less than 1% of headcount, Microsoft has eliminated approximately 15,300 positions in 2025 alone—representing nearly 7% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. These aren’t random cuts across the organization. In Microsoft’s home state of Washington, software engineering was by far the largest single job category to receive layoff notices, making up more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut in the May round. Microsoft announced its most recent round of cuts on July 2, 2025, affecting about 9,000 employees—less than 4% of its global workforce. This follows the May announcement of 6,000 layoffs, at least 300 additional cuts in June, and smaller performance-based reductions in January. As one person familiar with the matter told CNBC, Microsoft is continuing to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives. The escalating pace of job cuts is particularly striking given Microsoft’s strong financial performance and comes after CEO Satya Nadella revealed that up to 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI, with Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that number could hit 95% by 2030. Meanwhile, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion in AI-enabled datacenters around the world during fiscal year 2025 – a significant increase from the $53 billion capex spend Microsoft made in 2023. Microsoft isn’t alone in its workforce reduction strategy. The tech industry’s largest companies have all implemented significant layoffs in 2025, with CEOs increasingly linking these cuts to AI adoption and efficiency gains. Meta: Mark Zuckerberg announced in January that Meta would cut approximately 5% of its workforce—about 3,600 employees—targeting what he called “low performers” to make room for AI investments. In his internal memo, Zuckerberg stated: “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams. I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster.” Google/Alphabet: Sundar Pichai announced a 10% reduction in managerial roles as part of Google’s yearlong push for efficiency. Despite this, Pichai has taken a more optimistic stance on AI’s impact, telling Bloomberg: “I expect we will grow from our current engineering base even into next year, because it allows us to do more. AI is an accelerator that will drive new product development, thereby creating demand for more employees.” Amazon: Andy Jassy was the most direct about AI’s impact, telling employees that “we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today” as the company adopts more AI tools. Amazon has already laid off more than 27,000 employees since 2022, and Jassy stated: “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” The pattern is consistent across Silicon Valley: while revenue and AI investments soar, human workforces are being systematically reduced in favor of automated alternatives. While Microsoft has characterized the layoffs as organizational restructuring to “reduce layers of management”, industry observers see a different pattern emerging. Paul Roetzer of the Marketing AI Institute calls it “quiet AI layoffs”—job cuts that are ostensibly about cost savings or restructuring, but are actually driven by a belief that AI can replace (or reduce the need for) human labor. The evidence supports this interpretation. Relatively fewer sales or marketing positions were affected in the recent layoffs, while technical roles bore the brunt of the cuts. This suggests Microsoft isn’t simply trimming costs—it’s reallocating resources based on where it believes AI can most effectively substitute for human workers. Microsoft has also mandated AI use across its workforce, making it a part of employees’ daily workflow and performance evaluations, further cementing AI’s role in the company’s operations. Microsoft isn’t alone in this transformation. So far in 2025, more than 22,000 workers have been laid off across the tech industry, with many companies citing AI investments as a strategic priority. Meta announced performance-based layoffs of about 5% in January and Salesforce said it would be laying off about 1,000 employees as it redoubles its AI efforts. The pattern is clear: as AI capabilities expand, companies are betting they can maintain or increase productivity with fewer human employees. Analyst Gil Luria told Reuters that with consistent investments of this scale over the next few years, Microsoft may continue to lay off 10,000 workers to “make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures”. Microsoft’s massive infrastructure investment reflects the enormous computational requirements of modern AI systems. More than half of Microsoft’s $80 billion investment will be in the United States, positioning the company to compete in what Microsoft president Brad Smith describes as a “golden opportunity” for American economic competitiveness. Smith described AI as set to become a “world-changing general-purpose technology” and stated that “AI offers not only new tools for people’s work but also new ways to help people learn almost anything”. However, the irony isn’t lost on employees: the same technology promising to enhance human capabilities is simultaneously displacing human workers. The infrastructure investment is also driven by competitive pressures. Having invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI, Microsoft provides cloud infrastructure to the startup and has incorporated its models into Windows, Teams and other products. Microsoft’s revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 33% in the fiscal first quarter, with 12 percentage points stemming from AI services. The implications for Microsoft’s workforce—and knowledge workers more broadly—are profound. If AI is increasingly building the software, companies need fewer people to do that job. The fact that coders were hit hardest among Microsoft’s layoffs while customer-facing roles were largely untouched suggests that companies see AI as most immediately capable of replacing technical rather than interpersonal work. This creates a challenging atmosphere where “it is obvious to most that their performance does not guarantee a successful career, despite the company’s earlier announcement of a stringent performance policy”. Employees can no longer assume that strong performance will protect them from AI-driven displacement. Microsoft’s transformation continues with the July 2025 announcement of 9,000 additional layoffs, bringing the year’s total workforce reduction to over 15,000 employees. The company’s announcement came on the second day of Microsoft’s 2026 fiscal year, reflecting a pattern where executives typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year. Microsoft executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions—growth areas heavily dependent on AI infrastructure rather than human workforce expansion. These moves signal that Microsoft’s workforce reduction isn’t a one-time adjustment but an ongoing transformation representing one of the most aggressive restructuring campaigns in the company’s 50-year history, surpassed only by the elimination of 18,000 employees in 2014 following the Nokia acquisition. For Microsoft, the equation is straightforward: why maintain expensive human capital when AI can perform many of the same functions at scale? As Smith noted, the company sees AI infrastructure as “the essential foundation of AI innovation and use”—a foundation that, increasingly, doesn’t require as many human builders. The message from Redmond is clear: In Microsoft’s vision of the future, there’s room for either extensive human workforces or massive AI infrastructure investments, but not both. And the company has made its choice. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

How will the bill impact your life? At Vox, we’re focused on helping you make sense of it all. Our journalism is designed to empower you to understand the news and how it affects your life. But we can’t do it alone. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It’s okay to hate AI’s encroachment into work. Learn to use it anyway. A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes. ChatGPT’s most advanced models recently served me a surprising statistic: US productivity grew faster in 2024 than in any year since the 1960s. Half that jump can be linked to generative AI tools that most workers hadn’t even heard of two years earlier. The only problem is that it’s not true. The AI made it up. Despite its much-documented fallibility, generative AI has become a huge part of many people’s jobs, including my own. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but a June Gallup poll found that 42 percent of American employees are using AI a few times a year, while 19 percent report deploying it several times a week. The technology is especially popular with white-collar workers. While just 9 percent of manufacturing and front-line workers use AI on a regular basis, 27 percent of white-collar workers do. Even as many people integrate AI into their daily lives, it’s causing mass job anxiety: A February Pew survey found that more than half of US employees worried about their fate at work. Unfortunately, there is no magic trick to keep your job for the foreseeable future, especially if you’re a white-collar worker. Nobody knows what’s going to happen with AI, and leadership at many companies is responding to this uncertainty by firing workers it may or may not need in an AI-forward future. “If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it.” After laying off over 6,000 workers in May and June, Microsoft is laying off 9,000 more workers this month, reportedly so the company can reduce the number of middle managers as it reorganizes itself around AI. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that the company would “roll out more generative AI and agents” and reduce its workforce in the next few years. This was all after Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned AI would wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the same timespan, a prediction so grim that Axios coined a new term for AI’s imminent takeover: “a white-collar bloodbath.” This is particularly frustrating because, as my recent encounter with ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate makes clear, the generative AI of today, while useful for a growing number of people, needs humans to work well. So does agentic AI, the next era of this technology that involves AI agents using computers and performing tasks on your behalf rather than simply generating content. For now, AI is augmenting white-collar jobs, not automating them, although your company’s CEO is probably planning for the latter scenario. Maybe one day AI will fulfill its promise of getting rid of grunt work and creating endless abundance, but getting from here to there is a harrowing proposition. “With every other form of innovation, we ended up with more jobs in the end,” Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor and author of the newsletter One Useful Thing, told me. “But living through the Industrial Revolution still kind of sucked, right? There were still anarchists in the street and mass displacement from cities and towns.” We don’t know if the transition to the AI future will be quite as calamitous. What we do know is that just as jobs transformed due to past technological leaps, like the introduction of the personal computer or the internet, your day-to-day at work will change in the months and years to come. If AI really is this era’s steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it. At the same time, becoming an AI whiz will not necessarily save you if your company decides it’s time to go all in on AI and do mass, scattershot layoffs in order to give its shareholders the impression of some efficiency gains. If you’re impacted, that’s just bad luck. Still, having the skills can’t hurt. It’s okay to be scared of AI, but it’s more reasonable to be confused by it. For two years after ChatGPT’s explosive release, I couldn’t quite figure out how a chatbot could make my life better. After some urging from Mollick late last year, I forced myself to start using it for menial chores. Upgrading to more advanced models of ChatGPT and Claude turned these tools into indispensable research partners that I use every day — not just to do my job faster but also better. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.) But when it comes to generative AI tools and the burgeoning class of AI agents, what works for one person might not be helpful to the next. “Workers obviously need to try to ascertain as much as they can — the skills that are most flexible and most useful,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. “They need to be familiar with the technology because it is going to be pervasive.” For most white-collar workers, I recommend Mollick’s 10-hour rule: Spend 10 hours using AI for work and see what you learn. Mollick also recently published an updated guide to the latest AI tools that’s worth reading in full. The big takeaways are that the best of these tools (ChatGPT from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Google Gemini) can become tireless assistants with limitless knowledge that can save you hours of labor. You should try different models within the different AI tools, and you should experiment with the voice features, including the ability to use your phone’s camera to share what you’re seeing with the AI. You should also, unfortunately, shell out $20 a month to get access to the most advanced models. In Mollick’s words, “The free versions are demos, not tools.” “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” You can imagine similar advice coming from your geeky uncle at Thanksgiving circa 1984, when personal computers were on the brink of taking over the world. That was the year roughly the same percentage of white-collar workers were regularly using PCs at work as are using AI today. But the coming AI transition will look different than the PC transition we’ve already lived through. While earlier digital technologies hit frontline workers hardest, “AI excels at supporting or carrying out the highly cognitive, nonroutine tasks that better-educated, better-paid office workers do,” according to a February Brookings report co-authored by Muro. This means AI can do a lot of the tasks that software engineers, architects, lawyers, and journalists do, but it doesn’t mean that AI can do their jobs — a key distinction. This is why you hear more experts talking about AI augmentation rather than AI automation. As a journalist, I can confidently say that AI is great at streamlining my research process, saving me time, and sometimes even stirring up new ideas. AI is terrible at interviewing sources, although that might not always be the case. And clearly, it’s touch-and-go when it comes to writing factually accurate copy, which is kind of a fundamental part of the job. That proposition looks different for other kinds of white-collar work, namely administrative and operational support jobs. A Brookings report last year found that 100 percent of the tasks that bookkeepers and clerks do were likely to be automated. Those of travel agents, tax preparers, and administrative assistants were close to 100 percent. If AI really did make these workers redundant, it would add up to millions of jobs lost. “The thing I’d be most worried about is if my task and job are very similar to each other,” Mollick, the Wharton professor, explained. “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that’s being done repetitively, that’s where the most risk comes in.” It’s hard to AI-proof your job or career altogether given so much uncertainty. We don’t know if companies will take advantage of this transition in ways that produce better products and happier workers or just use it as an excuse to fire people, squandering what some believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform work and productivity. It sucks to feel like you have little agency in steering the future toward one outcome or the other. At the risk of sounding like your geeky uncle, I say give AI a try. The worst-case scenario is you spend 10 hours talking to an artificially intelligent chatbot rather than scrolling through Instagram or Reddit. The best-case scenario is you develop a new skill set, one that could very well set you up to do an entirely new kind of job, one that didn’t even exist before the AI era.

Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. READ MORE: More Americans file for unemployment help but layoffs remain low despite uncertainty over tariffs The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. READ MORE: China says U.S. violating tariffs truce with moves on AI chips and student visas Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would’ve faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don’t import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he’ll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he’d reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it’s close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There’s a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs’ costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. WACTH MORE: What’s ahead for U.S. economy as global market reacts to Trump’s tariffs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.

Title: Intel might axe the 18A process node for foundry customers, essentially leaving TSMC with no rival — Intel reportedly to focus on 14A

TSMC's N2 and A16 may have no rivals When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lip-Bu Tan, the chief executive of Intel, is considering stopping the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication technology (1.8nm-class) to foundry customers, instead shifting the company's efforts to its next-generation 14A manufacturing process (1.4nm-class) in a bid to secure orders from large customers like Apple or Nvidia, reports Reuters. If this shift in focus occurs, it would be the second node in a row that Intel has deprioritized. The proposed adjustment could result in major financial consequences and alter the trajectory of Intel's foundry operations, as it will effectively withdraw the company from the foundry market for several years. Intel informs us that the information is based on market speculation. However, the spokesperson provided some additional insight on the company's roadmap, which we've added further below.“We are not going to comment on market rumors and speculation," an Intel spokesperson said to Tom's Hardware. "As we have said previously, we are committed to strengthening our roadmap, delivering for our customers and improving our financial position for the future." After taking the helm in March, Lip-Bu Tan announced intentions to cut costs in April, which is expected to involve layoffs and the cancellation of certain projects. According to the new report, by June, he began sharing with colleagues that the 18A manufacturing process — a technology designed to showcase Intel's manufacturing prowess — was losing appeal to outside customers, which is why he believed it made sense for the company to shift away from offering 18A and its performance-enhanced 18A-P version to foundry customers. Instead, Lip-Bu Tan proposed directing more resources to the completion and promotion of 14A, the company's next-generation node, which will be ready for risk production in 2027 and for volume production in 2028. Given the timing of 14A, it is now time to start promoting it among potential third-party Intel Foundry clients. Intel's 18A fabrication technology is the company's first node to utilize its 2nd-generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, along with a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). By contrast, 14A utilizes RibbonFET 2 transistors, PowerDirect BSPDN, which delivers power directly to each transistor's source and drain through specialized contacts, and features Turbo Cells for critical paths. In addition, 18A is Intel's first leading-edge technology that is compatible with third-party design tools and can be used by its foundry customers. Dropping external sales of 18A and 18A-P would require Intel to account for a substantial write-off reflecting the billions it spent developing the manufacturing technologies, according to individuals familiar with internal deliberations cited by Reuters. Depending on how you count development costs, the resulting charge could total hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Both RibbonFET and PowerVia were initially developed for 20A, but that technology was cancelled for internal products last August in a bid to focus on 18A for both internal and external products. Intel's rationale behind the move may be rather simple. By limiting the number of potential customers for 18A, the company may potentially cut its operating costs. The majority of tools required for 20A, 18A, and 14A (except for High-NA EUV equipment) are already in place at its Fab D1D in Oregon, as well as at Fabs 52 and 62 in Arizona. However, once these tools are formally put into operation, the company will have to report their depreciation as a cost. Not putting them online potentially enables Intel to cut its costs amid uncertainties with orders from third-party clients. In addition, by not offering 18A and 18A-P to external customers, Intel may save money on engineers dedicated to supporting the sampling, ramp, and mass production of third-party circuits at Intel fabs. Obviously, this is speculation on our side. However, by ceasing to offer 18A and 18A-P to external clients, Intel will be unable to demonstrate advantages of its fabrication nodes to a broad range of customers with various designs, which would leave them with a single choice for next two or three years: go with TSMC and use N2, N2P, or even A16. Although Samsung is set to formally start making chips on its SF2 (also known as SF3P) node later this year, that node is expected to be behind Intel 18A and TSMC's N2 and A16 in terms of power, performance, and area. Essentially, Intel would not be showing up to its fight against TSMC's N2 and A16, which will certainly not help to gain the confidence of potential clients towards other Intel offerings, namely 14A, 3-T/3-E, Intel/UMC 12nm, and others. Reuters' sources familiar with the matter explained that Lip-Bu Tan had asked Intel's specialists to prepare proposals for discussion with Intel's board this fall. Options could include ceasing efforts to sign up new clients for 18A, though given the scale and complexity of the issue, the decision might not be finalized until the board meets again later this year. Intel itself reportedly declined to discuss hypothetical scenarios but confirmed that the main customer for 18A has always been its own Products division, which plans to begin producing codenamed Panther Lake CPUs for laptops in 2025 using this technology. Eventually, 18A and 18A-P will be adopted by Clearwater Forest, Diamond Rapids, and Jaguar Shores products. Intel's push to attract large-scale external clients to its Intel Foundry fabs remains critical to its turnaround, as only with high volumes the company will be able to pay off for its process technologies that cost billions to develop. However, in addition to Intel itself, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defence have formally confirmed plans to use 18A. While Broadcom and Nvidia are also reportedly testing Intel's latest process technology, they have yet to commit to using it for actual products. Intel's 18A has one key advantage over TSMC's N2: it features backside power delivery, which is particularly useful for power-hungry processors aimed at AI and HPC applications. TSMC's A16 with Super Power Rail (SPR) will only enter mass production in late 2026, so 18A will maintain the advantage of offering backside power delivery for Amazon, Microsoft, and potentially other customers for a while. However, N2 is expected to offer higher transistor density, which is beneficial for the vast majority of chip designs. Furthermore, while Intel has been running Panther Lake silicon at its D1D fab for quarters (so, currently Intel is still in risk production using 18A), the company's high-volume Fab 52 and Fab 62 started to run 18A test silicon this March, so they will start producing commercial chips only late in 2025, or rather in early 2025. Intel's external customers are, of course, interested in producing their designs at high-volume fabs in Arizona rather than at development fabs in Oregon. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly considering halting the promotion of the company's 18A fabrication process to external clients and instead focusing on the next-generation 14A production node, aiming to attract large customers such as Apple and Nvidia. The move could trigger massive write-offs, as Intel has spent billions developing 18A and 18A-P process technologies. Shifting focus to 14A could help cut costs and better prepare the node and operations for third-party clients, but the move risks undermining customer confidence in Intel's foundry capabilities ahead of 14A's planned production in 2027–2028. While the 18A node remains critical for Intel’s own products, such as Panther Lake CPUs, limited demand from third parties — so far, only Amazon, Microsoft, and the U.S. Department of Defense have confirmed plans to use it — has raised concerns about its viability. The potential decision — which will essentially withdraw Intel from the broad foundry market until 14A comes to market — will be reviewed by Intel's board later this year. Even if Intel eventually chooses to remove 18A from its foundry offerings, aimed at a broad range of applications and clients, the company will still manufacture chips using 18A for its own products, which are already designed for the process. It also intends to fulfill limited orders it has already committed to, including supplying chips for the aforementioned clients.

Title: Microsoft to lay off around 9,000 workers in largest cuts since 2023 | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, its third round of cuts in recent months, the company confirmed on Wednesday. The staff reduction will affect less than 4% of the company’s total workforce, or around 9,000 workers, according to a company spokesperson. It marks the tech giant’s largest layoffs since it cut 10,000 employees in 2023 and comes amid workforce cuts elsewhere in the tech industry. Microsoft’s stock was unchanged following the announcement. “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company is reducing managerial layers and making employees more productive with new technologies. The staff reduction also comes as tech companies, including Microsoft, are using artificial intelligence to make their workforce more efficient. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that 20% to 30% of the company’s code was being generated by AI, and the company is pouring billions into AI infrastructure investments. Related article Microsoft to lay off 3% of workforce, report says It’s unclear whether AI directly contributed to Wednesday’s cuts and which Microsoft divisions will be affected. The Verge reported that Xbox leader Phil Spencer sent an internal note saying that his staff would be affected. Bloomberg also previously reported that the planned July layoffs would target the sales and Xbox teams. Wednesday’s cuts come after Microsoft laid off 3% of its staff, roughly 7,000 employees, in May. As of July 2024, the last time Microsoft formally reported its total headcount, the company employed 228,000 workers. Other tech companies have also conducted layoffs this year, including Meta and Bumble. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also warned his staff last month that AI would eventually help the company reduce headcount. Microsoft said in April that its quarterly profits had increased 18% to $25.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, on the back of strong performance for its cloud business and AI services. The company is expected to release earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter later this month. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Microsoft is conducting another major round of layoffs

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year. The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees. Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave. "We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement. The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient. A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes. The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers. Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven. It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency. Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."

Title: Microsoft to Cut About 4 Percent of Jobs Amid Hefty AI Bets

Photo Credit: Reuters Microsoft had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024 Microsoft will lay off nearly 4% of its workforce, the company said on Wednesday, in the latest job cuts as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month. The Windows maker had pledged $80 billion in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year. Microsoft said on Wednesday it planned to reduce organizational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles. The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on Wednesday. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs. Big Tech peers, which are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, have also announced job cuts. Facebook parent Meta earlier this year said it would trim about 5% of its "lowest performers", while Alphabet's Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year. Amazon has also cut jobs across its business segments, most recently in its books division. The company had earlier laid off employees in its devices and services unit, and communications staff. Economic uncertainties and rising costs have triggered layoffs across sectors in Corporate America, as companies rush to streamline operations and hedge against further cost pressures. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Title: Intel Just Blinked—And It Could Mean A Breakup Is Coming

ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. 29 April 2025, USA, San Jose: Lip-Bu Tan, Chief Executive Officer of Intel, appears at an event ... More organized by the company. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) Most investors chase headlines. I follow behavior. Today, Intel said more about the true state of its business—not in a press release, but in a quiet strategic walk-back that most will miss. Is Intel going for a breakup? Reuters reports that Intel’s new CEO is contemplating abandoning efforts to promote its highly anticipated 18A chip technology to external customers, despite having already invested billions in its development and promotion. On the surface, it’s a shift in product focus. But beneath this shift, it reveals a deeper behavioral insight. Intel envisioned its 18A chip node as the breakthrough technology that would spearhead its return to advanced chip manufacturing and secure foundry contracts from hyperscalers such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. Now? Intel is quietly shelving it. Instead, Intel will pivot external customers to its newer 14A process, effectively cutting its losses and leaning into a more focused narrative: fewer bets, better execution. At the same time, the company is shuttering its automotive chip division, laying off staff across its foundry unit, and simplifying decision-making inside the fabs. That’s not cost-cutting. That’s positioning. This action isn’t an isolated move; it’s a pattern. And patterns in corporate behavior often preceded structural change. To the average investor, the move looks like textbook discipline: cut a struggling initiative, refocus on core customers, and redeploy capital more efficiently. But for those of us who study special situations, spinoffs, and corporate behavior, it signals something deeper. This isn’t just strategy, it’s a reset in how Intel thinks. This isn’t just about a product pivot. It’s a behavioral inflection point—and the kind that often comes before structural change. Let’s be clear: Intel hasn’t announced a spinoff. There’s no Form 10, no S-1, and no public timeline to separate the foundry business—yet. But in my experience, corporate breakups don’t start with filings. They start with behavior. And right now, Intel is moving like a company preparing to split. Here’s what I’m watching: Breakup isn’t just about unlocking value. They’re about rebuilding trust. Intel isn’t there yet—but it’s signaling to investors: We’ve heard you. We’re cleaning the house. Stick with us. And for special situation investors, that’s a setup worth tracking closely. Intel remains a complex name. But this foundry pullback offers three critical insights for investors watching through a special situation’s lens: For now, the situation is not a trigger. But in my experience, the best setups don’t come labeled. You need to delve deeper into the details. After nearly two decades studying breakups, restructurings, and hidden value plays, one thing is clear: they rarely start with headlines. They start with quiet decisions, internal shifts, and changes in incentives, not narratives. Intel’s foundry pivot might not spark a re-rating tomorrow. But for investors who track structural change, this is the kind of move that matters. It’s not the event, it’s the signal. Flag it. Log it. Watch it. An Intel breakup may be coming.

Title: Analysis shows Trump's tariffs would cost US employers $82.3 billion

Josh Boak Associated Press Published: July 2, 2025 at 6:26 AM Updated: July 2, 2025 at 11:56 AM Josh Boak Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved FILE - President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, May 23, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. Recommended Videos The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

Title: Your manager might be asking AI whether or not they should fire you

Azure Gilman is the deputy editor for the Leadership desk at Fortune, assigning and editing stories about the workplace and the C-suite. Good morning! HR departments around the globe are trying to figure out how to implement AI into their company’s workflow, increase productivity, and cut down on busy work. But bosses may already be taking matters into their own hands and turning to robots when it comes to high-stakes personnel decisions. Around 60% of managers rely on AI to make choices about their direct reports, according to a new survey from Resume Builder, a career website. Out of this cohort, managers are using the technology to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and terminations (64%). Those statistics are concerning enough, but the training that these managers have under their belts while they ask AI for help makes them even more frightening. Only about 32% of managers using AI to manage people have received formal training to ethically do so, according to the report. And around 24% have received no training at all. “It’s essential not to lose the ‘people’ in people management,” says Stacie Haller, a career expert at Resume Builder. “While AI can support data-driven insights, it lacks context, empathy, and judgment. AI outcomes reflect the data it’s given, which can be flawed, biased, or manipulated. Organizations have a responsibility to implement AI ethically to avoid legal liability, protect their culture, and maintain trust among employees.”The latest study on how bosses are actually using AI emphasizes how untamed the practice really is in corporate America. Although companies are talking the talk when it comes to how they want employees to use LLMs, far fewer are walking the walk and creating coherent training and guidelines for their workforce. That freeform nature of AI use we’re seeing right now is exactly why some states like Colorado have already passed legislation to try and create guardrails about what kind of consequences an employee can suffer because of AI. Others, like California, are in the middle of trying to pass their own bills—if a long-promised federal AI legislation moratorium doesn’t interrupt them first. There’s no doubt about it, our AI reality is here. And along with an overwhelming obsession with productivity, companies need to start asking themselves about the more human side of AI, and how individuals might turn to the technology in unexpected ways as a method to guide their decisions. After all, no employee wants to hear about how they were ultimately terminated by a robot. “Organizations must provide proper training and clear guidelines around AI, or they risk unfair decisions and erosion of employee trust,” says Haller.

BREAKING NEWS Josh Boak Associated Press Published: July 2, 2025 at 6:26 AM Updated: July 2, 2025 at 11:56 AM Josh Boak Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved FILE - President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House, May 23, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. Recommended Videos The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump’s current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins. The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president. Recommended Videos The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump’s import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed. The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do. Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: “Everything’s going well.” The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework. Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent “into our Territory” and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods. In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. “TOTAL ACCESS” to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning “we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.” He added he thinks SUVs “will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.” There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses’ inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand. The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers. The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.
