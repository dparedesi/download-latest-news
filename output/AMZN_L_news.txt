ByLiz Elting, Contributor. Juggling family and work responsibilities continues to be a constant challenge for many working parents, especially mothers. According to FlexJobs’ “Working Parents Report,” half of U.S. professionals say working mothers face higher standards than working fathers, while only 17% say the reverse. The report also found that over half of working women feel they shoulder the most responsibilities at both work and home, and that over half of working parents downplay caregiving duties to their employer to appear more committed. What’s more, recent return-to-office (RTO) mandates implemented this year by companies like JPMorgan, Amazon, and AT&T may further undermine work-life balance and gender equity for working parents, particularly for working mothers with young children who often rely on flexible work options to help balance work and family responsibilities. According to research from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, one-third of prime-age women (ages 25-54) with children under five telework, and both mothers and fathers with young children are more likely to work remotely than other adults. Meanwhile, Flex Index’s Q3 2025 “Flex Report” found that nearly half of Fortune 100 companies now require in-office work four to five days a week, and the Federal Reserve’s latest “Beige Book” notes that many firms are using RTO mandates to reduce headcount in place of formal layoffs. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that, as RTO mandates took effect this year, labor force participation among mothers of young children saw the steepest 6-month decline in over 40 years, dropping three percentage points between January and June 2025, according to data from the Care Board. As RTO mandates make it increasingly difficult for many mothers to remain in the workforce, companies should consider taking concrete steps to create more equitable workplaces for parents. As companies roll out company-wide RTO mandates, it’s critical that they recognize how these mandates can disproportionately impact working parents, especially mothers, who often rely on flexibility to balance caregiving responsibilities. Without flexible options, strict in-office requirements risk pushing talent out of the workforce or forcing parents to choose between prioritizing work and family. To counter this, companies should consider offering flexible work options to employees who would benefit most from them, such as working parents. According to FlexJobs’ report, 72% of working parents say flexible hours would better support them, and 65% believe remote or hybrid work would help them in their roles. FlexJobs author Kirsten Chorpenning describes flexible work as an “essential tool” that enables parents to stay in the workforce and grow in their careers, rather than stepping back due to inflexible demands. And as previously reported, in addition to more flexible workplace policies, interim executive and fractional leadership positions also offer working mothers the ability to work temporarily or part-time without having to forego leadership roles and career advancement. By embedding flexibility into workplaces, even within the framework of broader RTO plans, companies can reduce the negative impact those mandates can have on working parents and foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace that benefits everyone. After all, research shows that employees perform better when properly supported. As companies enforce RTO mandates, many working mothers are forced into difficult decisions between their families and their careers, and with rising childcare costs, many of those who don’t want to give up their careers are left with few options. Consequently, women who would have otherwise chosen to continue working are exiting the workforce to meet caregiving demands. According to Care.com’s “2025 Cost of Care Report,” the average cost of childcare (including nannies, daycares, and family care centers) now consumes 22% of household income, making the shift back to in-office work not just a logistical burden, but a financial one as well. FlexJobs’ findings reinforce this reality, with nearly half of U.S. professionals saying they would more likely stay in a role that offered employer-sponsored childcare. Providing subsidized childcare is another vital way for employers to support working parents, helping to reduce financial strains and potentially improve retention among working parents. In fact, Care.com’s report found that 79% of parents believe employers can reduce childcare expenses through subsidizing the cost of caregiving. Ultimately, when companies invest in employer-sponsored childcare, they’re more likely to foster a more equitable workforce as RTO mandates take effect. This in turn benefits employers, who see greater employee retention, morale and performance. Companies should also consider implementing active-listening strategies that encourage open dialogue between leadership and employees. This includes regular one-on-one meetings to better understand each employee’s individual needs and build stronger connections, as well as frequent surveys to gather feedback. These tactics can help leaders understand specific benefits their teams are seeking and may provide insight into the unique challenges their employees are facing and what can be done to support them so they can do their best work. Improving communication with work teams can also help companies avoid broad, one-size-fits-all approaches that rarely work for everyone. For example, as previously reported, remote work can sometimes hinder rather than help women’s careers, since women often receive higher pay raises and more mentorship opportunities when they are physically present with coworkers. Therefore, while remote work might benefit some working mothers, it could also limit a woman just entering the workforce by reducing opportunities for guidance and career development. This underscores the importance of listening to and communicating with employees and offering flexible solutions so that each employee can perform at their best. It enables employers to understand what is and isn’t working for each individual, rather than applying blanket approaches that can hinder productivity, such as company-wide RTO mandates. Prioritizing individual employee needs doesn’t only benefit employees, it improves business outcomes. According to Future Forward Institute’s report titled “The Competitive Advantage of the Win-Win Workplace,” companies that invest in employee-focused benefits and work environments tend to achieve higher profitability. Despite recent setbacks, the long-term trend of more working mothers joining the labor force remains strong. Per the Care Board’s data, labor force participation among mothers of young children has risen from 58.9% in 1989 to 68.2% in 2025, marking decades of progress in workplace inclusion and gender equity. If companies choose to support working mothers now, this backslide will simply be a temporary stumble rather than a longer lasting fall. By embracing responsive, flexible and supportive workplace practices, employers can help ensure that progress for all working parents continues to build rather than unravel.

Title: Amazon contractor Accelore Group to lay off 200-plus workers in North Texas

DALLAS — A contractor for Amazon Logistics plans to lay off more than 200 workers at two facilities in North Texas, according to filings with the state. Accelore Group, which is contracted by Amazon Logistics for package delivery services, plans to cut 214 jobs at two Amazon Logistics facilities -- one in the 3700 block of San Jacinto Drive in Fort Worth and one in the 12800 block of Eastgate Drive in Mesquite -- by Nov. 1, according to a filing with the Texas Workforce Commission. The affected employees are primarily delivery associates, along with four dispatch managers, a fleet supervisor, an operations manager, a hiring manager and a helper, according to the filing. "All affected employees have been notified of their separation dates and that their separation from employment will be permanent," the letter, signed by Accelore Group CEO Akram Syed and filed with the Teas Workforce Commission, stated. An Amazon spokesperson said Accelore Group is exiting Amazon's delivery service partner program in which independent third-party groups, like Accelore Group, provide delivery drivers who deliver packages for Amazon. Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal, which first reported the news of Accelore Group's planned layoffs, report that the program launched in 2018 and seeks to help entrepreneurs start delivery businesses. "Accelore Group is exiting the Amazon Delivery Service Partner program. We're actively working to help connect affected employees with other Delivery Service Partners in the Dallas-Forth Worth region who are currently hiring," Amazon said in a statement. Accelore Group was founded in 2003 in the Dallas area, according to their website. Amazon also ended contracts with two Philadelphia-area delivery partners, leading to nearly 150 jobs being cut, as the Dallas Business Journal reported. Amazon has invested about $70 billion in Texas since 2019 and has 49 fulfillment centers, 33 delivery stations and 36 Whole Foods locations in the state, according to the DBJ. Amazon reportedly recently bought 120 acres of land in Terrell, which is about 30 miles east of Dallas, for "the development of an international distribution center."

Title: Trump administration proposes overhauling H-1B visa process for higher-paid workers

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time After announcing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, the Trump administration on Tuesday proposed overhauling the visa’s lottery selection process to prioritize higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign employees. The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers. The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21. The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade. The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random. The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once. The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and "incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.” It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.” The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields. The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S. If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said. Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data. The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months. If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research. Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said. Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies. “Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote. Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict. Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants. Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000. Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court. A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related. In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000. Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.

The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 262 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment.

Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

Title: Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee Sends Shockwaves Through Tech And Cybersecurity

ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation Friday that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one-time fee, which does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals, takes effect immediately. The proclamation, called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. It’s set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. As with Trump’s tariffs announcement, the proclamation sparked a strong public response. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. Many said that the news came out of nowhere and warned that it could harm American innovation. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry, more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year, according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8% compared to 4.3% for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to the Department of Government Efficiency. Government bodies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. The fee represents a costly inconvenience for large technology companies, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms, the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such as Security Operating Centers, moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by Nov. 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core, this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth and national security. The immediate shock and reaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.

Title: American labor has a new challenge: Trump’s $100K fee on H-1B visas | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks President Donald Trump’s latest effort to overhaul America’s legal immigration system — raising the annual fee on H-1B visa applicants from $215 to $100,000 — could deal a major blow to some US industries that rely on skilled foreign workers. During a signing at the Oval Office Friday, Trump argued that America needs “great workers” and that the newly imposed fee “pretty much ensures that that’s what’s going to happen.” Administration officials also claimed the hefty fee would incentivize companies to hire American workers. “The company needs to decide … is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home and go hire an American?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the signing. “That’s the point of immigration: Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people.” Of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted annually, another 20,000 are reserved for people with advanced degrees from American higher education institutions. But Trump’s allies have been divided on how to tackle the visa program. Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, whom Trump chose to lead the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, have defended companies that use the work visa and depend on foreign workers to operate. Steve Bannon, a top strategist in Trump’s first term, blasted H-1B visas on his “War Room” podcast in December 2024 as a “scam” by Silicon Valley titans, who are about “taking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.” Here’s what the new policy means for businesses and workers. The $100,000 visa fee, which takes effect Sunday at 12:01 a.m. ET, will apply only to new H-1B applications, according to the White House. The rule expires a year later, on September 21, 2026, unless it’s extended. “This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Saturday, adding that it does not apply to renewals or current visa holders. Google and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, advised visa holders to reconsider international travel plans and to consider returns to the United States by Saturday night, if necessary, according to emails viewed by CNN. But Leavitt clarified Saturday afternoon that any current H-1B holders who are outside the United States will not be charged $100,000 to reenter. Most H-1B petitions approved during fiscal 2024 — which spanned from October 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024 — were for computer-related roles (64%), according to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report. The next largest occupation was in the field of architecture, engineering and surveying (10%). The third-most-approved petitions were for education-related jobs (6%), according to USCIS. The “largest detailed industry sector” for approved H-1B visas was related to custom computer programming (25%). Professional, scientific and technical services was the No. 1 industry among employers (48%), while manufacturing (11%) was the second-most popular. According to the USCIS data hub, Amazon is the largest H-1B sponsor. The online retailing giant was approved for more than 9,000 H-1B visas during fiscal 2024. Tech giants also rely on the H-1B program, with Google sponsoring 5,364 approved H-1B visas in fiscal 2024, followed by Meta (4,844), Microsoft (4,725) and Apple (3,873). Small businesses and startups are more likely to balk at that $100,000 fee than companies like Amazon, Meta, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The four companies have a combined capitalization of about $11.1 trillion. The fee could also mean foreign-born workers would be denied entry-level positions, as the $100,000 cost would be too much of a burden to pay for a lower-waged worker. Recent college graduates, who are experiencing the worst market for new grads since the Covid-19 pandemic, could stand to gain from job openings if the openings remain in America. That’s particularly good news for computer science and tech-related graduates, who are entering the market amid rounds of layoffs and plummeting opportunities. During his 2016 campaign, Trump accused US companies of using H-1B visas “for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.” But the USCIS reported that, of approved H-1B petitions, the median annual compensation was $120,000. Companies will likely continue to offer higher-paying salaries to the best talent pool of foreign workers. But restrictions could make companies shift hiring initiatives abroad to countries like India, China and Canada, according to the American Immigration Council. Placing limits on H-1B holders doesn’t guarantee Americans will be hired in the impacted sectors. When immigration slowed during the pandemic and following the first Trump administration’s temporary ban on some immigrant visas, it led to record-high job openings. Economists warned at the time that the worker shortage couldn’t be solved without ramping up immigration. “Businesses are having to turn down work because they simply can’t find the workers to do it,” Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNN in 2021. The new fee on visas is likely to be challenged in US courts. “To be clear, the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X. “The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.” CNN’s Alejandra Jaramillo, Adam Cancryn, Matt Egan and Yong Xiong contributed to this report.
