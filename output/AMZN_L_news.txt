Skip to comments. Posted on 11/03/2025 8:51:12 PM PST by SeekAndFind Some major companies have recently triggered a wave of layoffs, eliminating tens of thousands of jobs. Most cited artificial intelligence (AI) integration and automation as factors behind these moves.In this photo illustration, a phone screen displays an AI logo on May 16, 2025. AI use in customer service is rising, with 70 percent of interactions expected to involve AI in 2025, according to Wifi Talents. Oleksii Pydsosonnii/The Epoch TimesExperts say that while a significant portion of jobs cannot be replicated by machines, AI will likely usurp white-collar analytical roles and robotics will replace manual labor jobs.Amazon announced on Oct. 28 that it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate positions to stay “nimble.”UPS, meanwhile, revealed that it had cut 34,000 operational jobs during the first nine months of this year—a significantly larger reduction than the 20,000 layoffs announced in April—as part of its “efficiency reimagined” initiative.Nestlé said on Oct. 16 that it will reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years in an effort to achieve “operational efficiency” by “leveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.”In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited). Airbus: Used Palantir to improve assembly of the A350 by about 30%—fewer delays, fewer mistakes, and more planes finished each month using the same factories and workers. BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail. These aren’t future promises—they’re real improvements in speed, cost, reliability, and output. This is what applied AI actually looks like in the real world.Stronger companies create real jobs. 15 posted on 11/04/2025 2:18:15 AM PST by RoosterRedux (“Critical thinking is hard; that’s why most people just jump to conclusions.”—Jung (paraphrased)) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind If you’re a low level coder, your days are numbered.

Most I suspect due to the terrible scold movies and tv shows they make but AI is replacing background players and set design builders etc. Some of that is due to the industry shift away from Hollywood. The Arri Alexa digital movie camera was released in 2010. Since then, movie producers had a more plentiful, less expensive, and better filming options than Hollywood could offer. The James Bond movie "Skyfall" (2012) was filmed using Alexa digital cameras and won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Add in Computer Generated Imagery and regular television shows can be filmed against a blue screen (or green screen), cutting back on set construction by instead using digital backgrounds created by lower cost overseas video editors. 20 posted on 11/04/2025 5:15:39 AM PST by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Amazon announced on Oct. 28 that it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate positions to stay “nimble.”UPS, meanwhile, revealed that it had cut 34,000 operational jobs during the first nine months of this year—a significantly larger reduction than the 20,000 layoffs announced in April—as part of its “efficiency reimagined” initiative.Nestlé said on Oct. 16 that it will reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years in an effort to achieve “operational efficiency” by “leveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.”In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited). Airbus: Used Palantir to improve assembly of the A350 by about 30%—fewer delays, fewer mistakes, and more planes finished each month using the same factories and workers. BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail. These aren’t future promises—they’re real improvements in speed, cost, reliability, and output. This is what applied AI actually looks like in the real world.Stronger companies create real jobs. 15 posted on 11/04/2025 2:18:15 AM PST by RoosterRedux (“Critical thinking is hard; that’s why most people just jump to conclusions.”—Jung (paraphrased)) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind If you’re a low level coder, your days are numbered.

All materials posted herein are protected by copyright law and the exemption for fair use of copyrighted works. Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Nestlé said on Oct. 16 that it will reduce 16,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years in an effort to achieve “operational efficiency” by “leveraging shared services and automating [its] processes.”In August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff disclosed on an podcast that the company had replaced about 4,000 customer support workers with AI agents.In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In the past, businesses typically downsized during economic downturns, but these recent staff reductions occurred during a period of robust profitability, signaling something different—a transformation in the way work itself is organized, driven by the rapid diffusion of AI.Unlike past automation waves that mimicked the functions of the human body—replacing manual or routine tasks—AI targets the human brain’s cognitive abilities. It doesn’t just perform repetitive processes; it learns, analyzes, and makes decisions.Together, these twin shifts—manual automation and cognitive automation—are remaking both unskilled and skilled labor. The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

The result: some jobs are being transformed, others are being cut.In a statement included in its job cut announcement, the company explained that AI’s transformative force requires new organizational structures: “It’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before ... We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”However, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s Oct. 30 earnings call that the recent layoff announcement was not “really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”AI Diffusion Across the WorkforceEconomists, central banks, and think tanks have documented AI’s rapid spread across workplaces.A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that by early 2023, generative AI—the class of AI capable of creating new content—had become widespread across the American workforce. Tools such as ChatGPT were embedded in browsers, office software, and search engines, making large language model usage routine for millions of workers.The bank found that occupations adopting generative AI most intensively—particularly computer and mathematical fields—experienced the steepest unemployment gains.“Our results suggest we may be witnessing the early stages of AI-driven job displacement,” the report noted. “Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected manufacturing or routine clerical work, generative AI can target cognitive tasks performed by knowledge workers—traditionally among the most secure employment categories.”A Brookings Institution report estimates that 30 percent of all U.S. workers could see at least half of their job tasks disrupted by generative AI. Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Unlike earlier automation, which primarily affected blue-collar work, AI is expected to reshape a broad range of “cognitive” and “nonroutine” occupations—especially those in middle- and high-income professions.Similarly, the McKinsey Global Institute has projected that automation (a combination of AI and robotics) could displace up to 54 million workers in the United States by 2030.Meanwhile, a Goldman Sachs analysis projects that widespread AI adoption could displace 6 to 7 percent of the U.S. workforce, equivalent to millions of jobs.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that temporary unemployment spikes by roughly 0.3 percentage points for each percentage-point gain in productivity from labor-saving technology.Jobs Most at RiskA Society for Human Resource Management study, published on April 25, offers a detailed snapshot of U.S. employment exposure to AI.According to the report, 12.6 percent of jobs—approximately 19.2 million positions—face a high or very high risk of automation-related displacement. Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Among them, 14 percent of blue-collar jobs, 12.3 percent of white-collar jobs, and 12.1 percent of service-sector jobs are considered at high risk.Meanwhile, a June 9 report from the freelance work platform Upwork identifies 120 jobs that are hard to be replaced by AI, including clinical, creative, and skilled trades roles.AI and Changing Nature of SkillsA December 2024 Harvard Business School paper shows that AI has a mixed impact on businesses’ labor demand.In automation-prone roles, AI reduces the need for specialized expertise by simplifying complex tasks. In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

Fixing problems created by bad management and using AI to identify better ways of running operations and eliminating inefficiencies, waste, and useless jobs.Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited). Airbus: Used Palantir to improve assembly of the A350 by about 30%—fewer delays, fewer mistakes, and more planes finished each month using the same factories and workers. BP: Runs virtual “digital twins” of oil platforms and fields so engineers can spot problems early, prevent breakdowns, and make better decisions before something goes wrong. National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail.

In augmentation-prone roles, however, it boosts productivity and increases demand for advanced, complementary skill sets.“As generative AI continues to evolve, understanding its heterogeneous effects on labor demand is critical,” the authors wrote. “Policymakers and business practitioners must recognize the dual forces of automation and augmentation to ensure that workers are equipped to adapt and thrive.”At the same time, research by Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu and colleagues—published in the Journal of Labor Economics—shows that as establishments adopt AI, they reduce hiring in non-AI positions and shift skill requirements across remaining roles.Andy Zenkevich, founder and CEO of Epiic, a digital agency specializing in generative engine optimization (GEO), told The Epoch Times that the fear of mass AI-driven job losses is overstated.“Among the companies we work with in digital marketing—including major tech firms—layoffs haven’t been the story,” he said. “Instead, jobs are morphing. A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

A junior copywriter becomes an ‘AI content editor,’ responsible for prompt engineering, fact-checking, and editing AI-generated copy.”Zenkevich estimated that roughly 2.5 percent of jobs are genuinely at risk under a full-scale AI rollout, noting that “true end-to-end automation is much harder than headlines suggest.”“Over a third of jobs now require hybrid skill sets that combine technical literacy with human qualities machines can’t replicate,” he said.Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of finance at Manhattan University, echoed a similar skepticism.“There’s a growing fear that artificial intelligence is wiping out jobs, but the reality is more complex,” he told The Epoch Times. “Companies aren’t cutting workers simply because AI made them redundant. In an uncertain economy, firms want to appear modern and future-ready. Announcing an ‘AI transformation’ reassures investors that management has a plan.”Koimisis argues that some layoffs, framed as part of AI restructuring, are more about signaling discipline to shareholders than about reflecting genuine technological necessity.“AI is changing not just how work is organized, but how value itself is defined,” he said.Izhar Haq, director of the School of Professional Accountancy at Long Island University, agrees that the slowing economy and business cycle are also contributing factors to recent job reductions.Haq told The Epoch Times that while the long-term economic effects of AI remain uncertain, “white-collar analytical jobs are most at risk from AI integration, while manual labor jobs face risk from robotics.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Computers/Internet; Society KEYWORDS: ai; jobs; unemployment Message from Jim Robinson: Dear FRiends, We need your continuing support to keep FR funded.

Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. 5 posted on 11/03/2025 9:02:54 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” 6 posted on 11/03/2025 9:28:31 PM PST by SaxxonWoods (Annnd....TRUMP IS RIGHT AGAIN.)

What a ridiculous time suck. I have NEVER gotten anything remotely useful from a phone AI agent / bot. AI is taking a toll on jobs not by replacing workers with itself, but by diverting resources to a company named nVidia. Not sure if AI has anything to do with it but... Tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced across major sectors in late October 2025, with UPS, Amazon, Intel and Nestlé leading the cuts. Over 112,000 tech jobs alone have been eliminated this year, and broader corporate downsizing is accelerating. Just during October alone, UPS announced 48,000 job cuts, Amazon 14,000, Intel 24,000, Nestle 16,000, Accenture 11,000, Novo Nordisk 9,000, Applied Materials 1,444, Target 1,000, Charter Telecom 1,200 and CBS/Paramount 1,000. These are notable corporations cutting staff, but other major companies like JPMorgan Chase have implemented a hiring freeze across multiple divisions in late 2025, driven by its aggressive deployment of artificial intelligence and cost discipline. Managers have been instructed to avoid hiring unless absolutely necessary. All of this screams to me, “Work for yourself!” wanna keep your business going? Have a human answering the phone instead of a computer. I threw contracts to providers simply because a human answered the phone. All it takes is one trip through “automated phone hell” to make up the price difference for parts. In the old days of touchtone phones, I would just press 0 to find a human. An online AI chat is very common these days. Instead of 0, I type in HUMAN. Sometimes it takes typing human 2 or 3 times. I have also run into AI while using the telephone customer service. No matter what the "choices" from the AI are, I just repeat HUMAN until they transfer to a living, breathing person. PS - I wonder if some young entrepreneur will develop an AI customer service with a thick East Indian accent. An online AI chat is very common these days. Instead of 0, I type in HUMAN.

Courage takes faith—faith in God, faith in reason, faith in the idea that progress and truth exist beyond our own anxieties. Fear shrinks the world. Faith and critical thought expand it. “What To Know”. Et tu, Epoch Times? Et tu? Here's an example of what Palantir is doing with its clients using AI: Swiss Re: After installing Palantir's software, they cut reporting time by up to 80%, freed about 30% of underwriters’ time, boosted data-team output by 50%, and earned back the entire cost of the system in 7 months, ending with a 170% return (independently audited).

National power company (unnamed): Used Palantir to map 10,000+ miles of power lines and find weak spots before they fail. These aren’t future promises—they’re real improvements in speed, cost, reliability, and output. This is what applied AI actually looks like in the real world.Stronger companies create real jobs.

Title: Layoffs accelerate as Trump economy flashes red warning signs

Time Published: 2025-11-04T01:38:12Z

Several major US corporations in the last month have announced plans to cut thousands of workers as layoffs in the American economy have reached their highest level since 2020, when much of the global economy was shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As reported by Bloomberg on Monday, major firms including Target, Amazon, Paramount, and Molson Coors in October announced plans to lay off a combined total of more than 17,000 workers for a wide variety of reasons ranging from the impact of artificial intelligence to declining sales. Taken together, these layoffs point to a significantly weakened labor market, which had already ground to a halt over the summer when the last jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed the economy created just 22,000 jobs in the month of August. And while the BLS has stopped releasing monthly employment reports during the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, Bloomberg pointed to data collected by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing that there have been “almost 950,000 US job cuts this year through September, the highest year-to-date total since 2020—and that was before the heavy October run of announcements.” Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, told Bloomberg that he has detected a definite shift in the jobs market in recent weeks. “We’re not just in a low hire, low fire environment anymore,” he explained. “We’re firing.” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, said in an interview with Reuters that he also expected the labor market to get worse in the coming months due to “adverse policy shocks emanating from Washington,” as well as “the change in behavior among corporates who hoarded labor for the past four to five years,” and were thus reluctant to carry out layoffs. “That was never an indefinite behavior,” he said. “We’re going to see migration up in the unemployment rate.” John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News last week that he didn’t think that the layoffs announced over the last month were just a blip. “These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,” he emphasized. One challenge for economists in assessing the current state of the economy is the vast gulf between the experiences of America’s highest-earning households and households at the bottom of the economic ladder. According to a Monday report from CNBC, recent corporate earnings reports have shown signs of a so-called “K-shaped” economy in which well-off consumers are maintaining or increasing their spending while low-income consumers are being forced to cut back. “Last week, Chipotle reported it’s seeing consumers who make less than $100,000 a year, which represents roughly 40% of the company’s customer base, spending less frequently due to concerns about the economy and inflation,” CNBC noted. “Coca-Cola said in its third-quarter earnings that pricier products like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes are driving its growth. Procter & Gamble reported similar results, saying wealthier customers are buying more from club retailers, which sell bigger pack sizes, while lower-income shoppers are significantly pulling back.” A Monday report from Fortune similarly picked up on evidence that the US is in the midst of a K-shaped economy, as it found that the percentage of Americans taking on subprime loans in the third quarter of 2025 reached its highest level since 2019. This is significant, Fortune noted, because an increased reliance on subprime loans “adds to signs that many are facing increased financial pressure” to make ends meet. What’s more, Fortune pointed to a recent analysis from Moody’s showing that the top 20% of households in the US are now responsible for economic growth, while the bottom 80% have essentially been stagnant. Lucia Dunn, an economist at Ohio State University, told Fortune that this economic disparity could increase instability if not addressed. “We are losing the middle class,” Dunn said. “And when you get to a society where there are a lot of people at the bottom and then a small group at the top, that’s a prescription for real trouble.” The reports of the layoffs in corporate American come as a new analysis released Monday by Oxfam offered the latest look at extreme wealth inequality in the US, with the the 10 wealthiest Americans gaining nearly $700 billion so far this year—and as millions of people have lost crucial federal food assistance due to the government shutdown and the Trump administration’s refusal to release full benefits.

Title: Palantir is proud of its 'disciplined' hiring practices

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Palantir is proud of its "disciplined" hiring practices. The defense tech company reported earnings that beat estimates on Monday, and CEO Alex Karp touted Palantir's approach to talent recruitment in his shareholder letter. Karp notes that while the company has "grown quite significantly," it has kept to its "constraints." "Our head count is one manifestation of this disciplined approach," Karp wrote in the letter to shareholders. "The casual expansion of our ranks would have diminished the need to lean even more heavily on the strength of our software and the Ontology and to ensure their continued maturation. "The alternative would have been to rely on an army of bright minds to do work that would have obscured the platform's weaknesses and ultimately hindered its development," Karp added. The message of maintaining a lean head count arrives at a moment when other companies are pivoting to leaner workforces. There have been significant layoffs at multiple large companies, particularly in middle-management roles. Throughout the year, Microsoft has laid off around 15,000 employees in total with multiple rounds of cuts. In October, Amazon announced it is cutting about 14,000 corporate jobs, or roughly 4% of its white-collar workforce, as part of an effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, the retail giant, also announced in the same month that it would lay off 1,000 corporate employees to eliminate what the company called "overlapping work." During Amazon's latest earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said that the company's rapid growth in recent years created "a lot more layers" that have slowed decision-making, and that the layoff is about "culture" instead of cost cutting or AI. To make the job market picture more unclear, the government shutdown is preventing the release of job data from September onwards. Based on the most recent available data from August, the labor market missed expectations by a wide margin. Jump to

by Michael Snyder | Nov 3, 2025 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. What is the Fed not telling us? The numbers clearly indicate that big trouble is brewing in the banking system. I wish that I could specifically tell you which banks are in the most trouble, but at this stage, we simply aren’t being told anything. They probably figure that the best approach is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible. But they won’t be able to keep a lid on what is going on indefinitely, and when word finally gets out, people could start to panic. In recent weeks, bank reserves have fallen to alarmingly low levels. In fact, last week they fell to the lowest level that we have seen in more than four years… US bank reserves have crashed to a four-year low, plunging to about $2.8 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve data, sending fresh warning signals across Wall Street and Washington. The steep decline marks the second straight week reserves have stayed below $3 trillion, a critical threshold analysts say could test the banking system’s liquidity strength. By itself, this doesn’t necessarily signal that we are facing a major crisis. But everyone agrees that what we are witnessing is certainly unusual. What is causing far more alarm is what occurred on Friday. All of a sudden, there was an insane amount of demand for overnight repo cash… Federal Reserve reportedly pumped about $29.4 billion into the markets via overnight repos. That’s a big number and it signals something I’m watching closely. According to the data for “Overnight Repurchase Agreements — Treasury Securities Purchased by the Fed” the figure for Oct 31, 2025 is $29.400 billion. In other words: The Fed is quietly stepping in and stepping up. To me, this is clear evidence that something just broke. Who suddenly needed that much cash? And why did they need it? The chart that I have posted below comes directly from the Federal Reserve, and it should chill you to the core… But that wasn’t the end of it. By the end of the day on Friday, it was quite obvious that something extremely strange had just happened… Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage. The Fed’s Standing Repo Facility lent a total of $50.35 billion on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of $51.8 billion. So what is the bottom line? The bottom line is that it very much smells like a major crisis is brewing. But let’s wait and see what happens on Monday. If we see figures on Monday that are fairly normal, perhaps we have more time before things start breaking loose in the markets. However, if we see even larger numbers on Monday, hold on tight. In either case, the financial markets will not be able to stay disconnected from the real economy forever. Just like in 2008 and 2009, large employers all over the United States have been conducting mass layoffs. Sadly, this time around that includes some of our largest and most prosperous employers… The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. We haven’t seen anything like this in many years. Bankruptcies are soaring, delinquency rates are spiking, thousands of stores and restaurants are permanently shutting their doors, and just about everything keeps getting more expensive. What we are now facing is being described as “Depression 2.0”. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning and most of the population understands this. In fact, one recent survey discovered that 57 percent of Americans expect economic conditions to get even worse over the next year. Many of you are going to be facing some very hard decisions in the coming months. If you currently have a job that you highly value, I would recommend holding on to it as tightly as you can. But if you feel that it is absolutely necessary to go somewhere else, you will just have to do what you have to do. Just understand that if you leave your current position it will not be easy to find a new one at all. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Many of them didn’t have anything to fall back on, and so large numbers of them also lost their homes. This is one of the reasons why it is so critical to have a sizable emergency fund. At this point, even the mainstream media is stressing the importance of this… Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the economy crashes, that leaves no room to breathe. Having three to six months of essential expenses tucked away can make all the difference when cash flow dries up or jobs disappear overnight. Keep your emergency savings in an easily accessible account, not tied up in volatile investments. It’s not about hoarding—it’s about buying time and peace of mind. When others panic, you’ll have the stability to make smart, calm decisions. I expect things to start moving very quickly now. If the problems in our banking system bubble to the surface and start becoming highly visible, it will create a lot of fear. And it is just a matter of time before our absurdly overvalued stock market takes a dramatic tumble. Of course, all of this is happening at a time when so many other elements of “the Perfect Storm” are coming together. We are right on the brink of multiple major wars, global food supplies are rapidly getting tighter, we are being told that the next worldwide pandemic could break out at any moment, and on average, the U.S. has been getting hit by a “billion-dollar disaster” about every two weeks. I expect so much chaos to be unleashed during the weeks ahead, and that means that we should expect the turmoil that we are currently witnessing on Wall Street to escalate quite a bit more.

Last week saw the Sundance Institute form a union, thousands of layoffs at Paramount, and buyouts at YouTube. It also brought two events that point toward the future: ZCON and Square Peg Social. Now in its third year, ZCON is a two-day, invitation-only event in Los Angeles that centers on (yes) Gen Z and the people who love them. That assortment of attendees included creators (of course) as well as CEOs, CMOs, and studio executives. Sessions included “Rewriting the Rules of Branded Entertainment” and “The New Hollywood.” Auli’i Cravalho (“Moana”) highlighted her impatience with the old ways (“We are told that we’re too young, to wait our turn”); Owen Thiele (“Adults”) premiered “Girl Room,” a show co-created with Amazon Prime for TikTok and for Instagram; and Paralympian Ezra Frech declared, “Gen Z is the most inclusive generation of all time,” reframing disability as a great way for brands to resonate with consumers.

Seeing so many young creators (and the creator adjacent) echoed similar groups at the Sundance Film Festival and SXSW. Of course, ZCON and Sundance are very different; brand partnerships are the lifeblood here, not distribution, and the event is owned by UTA. If Sundance is powered by pick-me energy and SXSW by VC hustle, the invite-only ZCON is doing something else altogether. It isn’t a tentpole so much as an extension of an ongoing conversation between founders and brands. A Gen Z nonprofit already knows that, say, Amazon’s global creative director is dying to know what they’ll do next, and development execs are on watch. Overseeing it all is Olivia Frary, a UTA Next Gen exec who came to the agency when it acquired Gen Z marketing company JUV Consulting in 2024. “For years, every single person on our team would end a call by just saying, “If there’s someone that you would want us to meet, let us know,” she said. “Even when we were super startup vibes, we would always kind of stress that was the best thing you could do for us, regardless of if you wanted to hire a Gen Z consultancy. A lot of [those connections] are showing up here that knew us when we were those crazy kids.” Now those same kids are shaping not only the culture, but also how it’s sold — at least until Gen A comes along. And if history is any guide, nothing will be more cringe to that generation than being called an influencer. For now, this cohort is enjoying the primacy so much that ZCON participants eagerly embraced an afternoon “recess” that featured a cavalcade of bubbles and dancing with a live DJ. Cringe to anyone else; here, it’s what happens before the final panel, “What Does a Happier Internet Look Like?” I’m going to wrap with a tease about digging into Square Peg Social, the inaugural, invite-only mentorship program created by Lars Knudsen and Ari Aster — a collaboration between established filmmakers and emerging voices. We previewed it this summer; nearly 1,800 applied. In the end, 37 writers, directors, and producers spent four days in direct mentorship with the creators behind not just Knudsen and Aster’s films (“Eddington,” “Midsommar,” “Beau Is Afraid”), but also “One Battle After Another,” “Iron Claw,” “Roofman,” “Rebel Ridge,” and more. Next week, I’ll share both the executive and filmmaker rosters (both are long and impressive; expect multiple stories). It would be the snarky/lazy thing to contrast the differences between Square Peg and ZCON (Art! Commerce!), but in truth they had more in common than not. Both are declarations of community, however self-selected. Because no matter where you land in this brave new world, one thing’s certain: No one will make it alone. (Bubbles remain optional.)

Title: Who’s Hit Hardest By Corporate America’s Mass Layoffs

ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. Amazon, Target, and UPS are some of the corporations that have recently announced job cuts. A slew of mass layoffs has hit corporate America, further exacerbating a stagnant job market. Other companies that announced mass layoffs include Intel, Nestle, Accenture, Ford, and Microsoft, among others. CBS also announced mass layoffs and has been mired in controversy; the company let go of veteran journalist Lisa Ling and a Variety report alleges that popular CBS anchor Gayle King will also be departing from the network. In addition, CBS dismantled their Race and Culture division and a former news producer named Trey Sherman accused the company of firing every person of color in his division. Some reports indicate that Amazon may have reduced staff because of the rise of AI but an Amazon spokesperson disputed this claim, according to CNN. Economic Times suggested that job cuts may be due to rising costs and slowing consumer spending. In addition, mass layoffs within the federal government have been ongoing since the start of 2025. The mass layoffs within several different industries coupled with the rising costs makes for a dangerous cocktail that threatens worker wellbeing. It's important to examine who is most impacted by these mass layoffs. Research reveals that women and non-white employees are more likely to be laid off than their counterparts. According to a 2016 Harvard Business Review report, when layoffs occur, women and racial minorities are more likely to be ousted. A 2021 study exploring the demographics of those laid off during the start of Covid-19 from January 2020 to August of 2020 mirror these findings; the research indicated that women and racial minorities were more likely to be laid off during this timeframe. The researchers theorized that this finding could be attributed to factors like direct discrimination against these groups and the fact that women and people from underrepresented racial groups are more likely to occupy lower status jobs than their counterparts. Mass layoffs can have deleterious and detrimental impacts on worker wellbeing, trust and psychological safety. A 2025 study exploring the impact of layoffs on employees within IT companies revealed that mass layoffs impacted employee engagement, loyalty, and organizational success. A 2022 study found that when companies didn’t meet employee expectations following downsizing, employee trust toward the organization was reduced as well as employee commitment and turnover intentions increased. Companies that must downsize should understand how to do it in a way that is ethical, empathetic and honors employee dignity. When layoffs are necessary, here are some best practices to consider: Companies should avoid faceless firing if possible, explained Tom Lakin in a 2022 Raconteurarticle. This type of firing lacks humanity and feels transactional. Lakin also suggested transparency as a necessary ingredient in your mass layoff strategy. Communicate with employees as much as possible why the layoffs are taking place (did the company over hire for example?) A 1994 article on ethical downsizing explained that employees should also be given as much advanced notice as possible, whenever possible, so they can plan accordingly. Candor, consistency and courtesy are the three C’s that managers should adopt and will go a long way during the layoff process. Layoffs are always going to be difficult; Those who are tasked with delivering the news of a layoff should be trained on ethical layoff practices. Mass layoffs can completely transform an organization. With the rise of AI and different industries experiencing financial strain due to varying factors, companies must figure out how to salvage employee trust and wellbeing. With more consumers considering how corporations treat employees in their buying decisions, gone are the days when companies could discard their employees without a second thought. In an era where more care and consideration are not only expected but demanded, staff reductions must be done in an ethical way that honors the dignity and humanity of every employee that is impacted. It’s not just the right thing to do; we live in a time when people are rising up and refusing to tolerate disrespect at the hands of corporations; the sustainability of any organization is determined by how well its employees are treated, especially during times of great change.

Title: The MMO being led by former WoW designer Greg Street looks to be dead as his studio officially closes after NetEase ends funding: 'While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment'

Greg Street said in October that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't secure new funding, and now the curtain has fallen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Less than a month after warning that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't find a new publisher for its in-development MMO, studio head Greg Street says the worst has come to pass, and the studio will close its doors on November 17. Street said in a message posted to LinkedIn that it's possible the studio will secure funding after that closure date, but "it will depend on how much of the team remains." "While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street wrote. He also thanked NetEase "for taking a chance on us." Street was heading up development of the League of Legends MMO when he opted to leave Riot Games in 2023 and launch Fantastic Pixel Castle to develop an all-new MMO for NetEase called Ghost. Fantastic Pixel Castle was one of several veteran-led studios launched by NetEase in 2022 and 2023, but the company took a sharp turn away from that strategy in late 2024, shuttering Worlds Untold, Jar of Sparks, T-Minus Zero, and now Fantastic Pixel Castle, all within the span of a single year. None of the closed studios was able to launch a single game. Sadly for Street's hope that Fantastic Pixel Castle employees will be able to find "stable" employment elsewhere, this sort of thing is not unique to NetEase. The past few years have seen thousands of game industry employees put out of work as studios of all sizes impose layoffs or close entirely, as the industry shifts away from the unsustainable excesses of the Covid-19 pandemic in favor of the unsustainable excesses of the AI bubble. October alone saw major layoffs at Amazon, Heart Machine, and Funcom, which also opted to close Metal: Hellsinger studio The Outsiders.

Title: Another MMO dead: ex-World of Warcraft and League of Legends lead's new studio "will close its doors" this month without releasing its flagship game Ghost

"Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Fantastic Pixel Castle, the indie studio from former League of Legends and World of Warcraft lead Greg Street, is closing. Street, who was previously World of Warcraft's lead systems designer, and then later lead gameplay designer on League of Legends and executive producer on Riot Games' elusive MMO, predicted last month that Fantastic Pixel Castle would "likely close" if it couldn't find a publisher for its flagship fantasy MMO, revealed in 2023 and codenamed Ghost. Well, unfortunately, Street's concerns have proven to be valid, as the MMO veteran announced on LinkedIn that "Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17." Street appeared to throw out a Hail Mary to potential investors who could still fund Ghost if enough of the studio sticks around despite the planned closure. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains," he said. "While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there." Fantastic Pixel Castle lost funding from NetEase last month, likely the catalyst to its closure following a weeks-long search for a new investor. Still, Street remained open to the possibility of a new backer in his announcement. "To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one," he wrote. This news follows closely on the heels of mass layoffs at Amazon and the end of new development on Amazon Games' MMO New World. In other words, it's been a rough few days for MMO fans, although there's still a small chance Ghost is funded before the studio shutdown.

I started working at Amazon on October 26, 2020 after spending over 14 years writing documentation for open web developers at Mozilla. My five years at Amazon Web Services involved: I was a victim of the October, 2025 layoffs at Amazon, just days after my five-year anniversary with the company. Thus I’m looking for a new role as a technical writer, senior technical writer, developer documentation writer, or code example developer. It’s a strange feeling; I have not had to look for a job very many times in my career, and it certainly isn’t an easy feeling knowing that everything you say and do could affect your future in a very visceral way. But I’ve never had difficulty finding work in the past, and if it weren’t for the current shortage of good technical writing job openings, I’d have no concerns this time around. However, with the broad assumption by management at many companies that AI will do all the writing work, as well as other factors, it’s not generally a good market for prospective technical writing employees. In my favor is the fact that I’ve got years of experience writing at a variety of companies. From operating system tech (both desktop and mobile) to the open web to cloud technologies, I’ve done in-depth documentation in a broad spectrum of the developer documentation field. That’s a big point in my favor. So is my talent for reading and writing code in a variety of languages, and my ability to pick up new languages quickly as needed. Not in my favor is that I need a remote position. I’m not able to relocate and I live in an area without many large employers that might need developer documentation. But I’ve spent decades working entirely from home, so I’m well-versed in applying myself appropriately to my job in my home environment. I learned a great deal at AWS, including a good deal about working with AI tools. I’m nowhere near an expert, but at the pace AI tooling is currently evolving, I feel that few people truly qualify as “experts” unless learning about AI is the majority of what they do. The job search is just beginning. I’ll be sure to post updates as things progress. Here’s hoping that my streak of finding jobs quickly continues! You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: The Double Bind of the AI Bubble Means We’re Screwed Whether the Tech Succeeds or Fails

The stock market is largely being propped up by a promise of AI that has yet to deliver—setting up what could be a disastrous bubble. But the AI land rush isn’t merely a risky gamble. Wall Street is staking the health of the markets—and that of the broader economy with it—on a bet against the common good. It seems to be a lose-lose situation for those outside Wall Street and Silicon Valley: If the frenzied investment in artificial intelligence is overheated, as even OpenAI’s Sam Altman has warned, the markets could be hit hard enough to shake the economy as a whole—making an impact worse than that of the dot-com bust 25 years ago. But if the gamble pays off, it’ll mean a boom for a technology that could bring about widespread unemployment and social disruption. “If this works as fast as VC money seems to be hoping, society seems wholly unprepared for the consequences,” as Daniel Barcay, executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, tells Vanity Fair, citing potential mass unemployment and political instability. “If the market is over its skis, then what we’re likely to see is a race to the bottom of these dark monetization patterns. We were promised curing cancer, but we’re getting AI slop.” AI has already led to significant layoffs across a number of industries, including at Amazon, which announced it would slash 14,000 white-collar jobs last week. And Americans appear concerned that it’s just the beginning, with more than two thirds of respondents in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll worrying that swaths of the workforce could be permanently displaced. That’s for good reason: A report released by Senator Bernie Sanders last month (which ironically made use of ChatGPT) estimated that close to 100 million American jobs could be eliminated in 10 years by AI. Other reports have reached similar conclusions. And while not all the data is quite so pessimistic, purveyors of the technology themselves have warned about looming job losses: Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, cautioned in an interview with Axios earlier this year that the tech could get rid of half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. As he described the scenario, AI could mean “cancer is cured, the economy grows at 10% a year, the budget is balanced—and 20% of people don’t have jobs.” Amodei said he had an “obligation” to warn of the potential consequences of AI. But other AI leaders have outright framed such workforce reductions as a selling point for their tech: “Stop Hiring Humans,” read a controversial ad from AI start-up Artisan. Some of that can be dismissed as bluster. But then, the scale of the investment in AI right now may only be able to be justified if the hyperbolic predictions about AI come to pass. Roughly a third of the S&P is riding on just seven tech companies, which are trading at values that far exceed their revenues. “There have been numerous similarities between this bubble and the internet bubble of 1999–2000,” as Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, tells VF: Investors are taking “aggressive action,” he says, while “standard protocols and risk controls are at least partially sidelined due to the air of urgency created by the euphoria.” Except, as MarketWatch noted last month, AI is currently seeing 17 times more investment than there was in the dot-com mania at the turn of this century. For that investment to pay off, the technology needs to deliver on its society-altering promise. So far, it’s mostly delivering slop. Indeed, even as companies rush to integrate the technology into their operations, they aren’t seeing much return on investment thus far. A McKinsey report in June shared that while almost 8 in 10 companies are using AI, that same number report seeing little to no impact on their bottom lines. Other research paints an even bleaker picture: In August, an MIT study found that 95%—95!—of companies using AI pilots saw no return on their investments of $30 billion to $40 billion. And a Gartner survey of human resources leaders, released last week, found that 88% said their businesses had not seen much value from their AI initiatives. Investors’ hope, of course, is that this will change and the gains will materialize. But it’s far from guaranteed that they will. And if the bubble bursts, the fallout could be worse than that of the dot-com meltdown, given how much the fortunes of AI and the economy as a whole are now intertwined. With uncertainty from Donald Trump’s impulse-driven tariff regime, political chaos in Washington, and ominous headwinds on the horizon that have investors seeking refuge in stable assets like [gold](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/investors-are-so-confident-in-the-trump-economy-theyre-turning-to-gold?srsltid=AfmBOoo9cBcUb77xGTK94jVn97gHpTuUrjJzT_ZnoW1ggd0JilzSBJFB) and silver, the only thing that seems to be propping up the markets is investors’ belief in the future of AI. “Big Tech is spending big on AI data centers, often financing them with unsustainable debt that puts the financial system at risk,” Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a critic of both Silicon Valley and Wall Street and the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, tells VF. “At the same time, we know that companies are already using AI to surveil workers’ every move and force schedules on them that maximize profits at the expense of their well-being. And the recent layoffs are a warning sign that AI could cause significant job losses.” “I worry that the Trump administration is asleep at the switch,” she adds. “Absent strong financial safeguards and labor practices, it’ll be workers, small businesses, and families who will pay the price.”

Title: So AI Is Coming For Your Job. We Have To Think About Jobs Differently

The Walrus Fact-based journalism that sparks the Canadian conversation When it comes to the future of work, there is only one certainty. Anyone who tells you that they know what is going to happen is either lying to you or trying to sell you something. We are in uncharted territory. And there is a lot of uncertainty. What we do know is that a lot is going to change. When I first started working on AI, there were three major camps when it came to thinking about jobs: Before ChatGPT, most people didn’t actually know much about how quickly deep learning was progressing. So position three was a pretty popular stance, and those who believed in option one were considered insane. But things have changed a lot in the past few years. Position three is now rarely discussed. It is just assumed that AI will have a massive impact on the labour market. And although position one is still quite taboo in academia, it is generally accepted as a possibility. But most researchers, myself included, fall into the category of position two. AI, in combination with advanced robotics research, has put a lot of jobs under the pressure of potential automation. Already, AI is being used in manufacturing, health care, therapy, management, programming, the arts, and construction, to name a few—it has basically penetrated every industry. In 2013, a now infamous Oxford University study predicted that approximately 47 percent of American jobs would be at risk of automation in the near future. The researchers may have been a little ambitious, but right now it’s not feeling like they were that far off. The reality is this: a lot of tasks that were traditionally considered to be safe from automation are no longer safe. Jobs that require artistic abilities or cognitive skills are now being automated. At the same time, the ability of machines to perform physical tasks is increasing as robots are fitted with AI systems that allow them to better sense and react to the world around them. AI’s automating powers are indiscriminate. They are affecting blue-collar manufacturing jobs and white-collar office jobs. Many who spent years, and thousands of dollars, developing specialized skills now need to live with the fact that AI can do their job faster and often better. It is a terrifying reality. What makes it even scarier is that we have no clue exactly how it is going to play out. There are just too many variables. For example, it is possible that a lot of companies will put off automating their staff and instead opt for retraining their current employees for new positions or finding ways to have them work with AI. This approach could spread out the potential economic disaster that would occur if there was suddenly mass unemployment due to rapid automation. Mass unemployment is bad (obviously) for a number of reasons. Economically, it presents a gigantic threat. If companies are producing more goods than ever due to automation, who’s going to buy them? There’s mass unemployment, and the people don’t have money to support businesses. Whether or not companies take this approach is not really in our hands. Even if they do, it’s possible that an unrelated financial recession will occur, forcing companies to lay off their employees, as is normal during a recession. However, this time, it may be different as they offset these layoffs by bringing in automation technology. Now, when the recession ends, the companies have no incentive to rehire their old employees. The prefabricated argument often used to confront fears of automation is that innovation inevitably creates new jobs. Although some jobs may be eliminated, the economic benefits of automation will create incentives for companies to create new jobs elsewhere in the economy; therefore, there is not actually anything to worry about! As much as I would love to believe in this take, as it is so comforting, it unfortunately does not hold up when put under the microscope. There are several major problems that emerge under scrutiny, even if we assume that this statement is partially true and that new jobs will materialize that we cannot foresee right now. The first problems are to do with speed and scale. When we typically talk about automation or innovation, it is in a very narrow sense. There may be a new innovation that automates a specific job in the dairy industry or in stock trading. But these instances are isolated. The automation in the dairy industry is not directly transferable to other industries. An automatic cow-milking system doesn’t have disruptive powers in other industries. However, the cost savings produced by the innovation could affect other parts of the industry. As production rises, the need for new jobs in other areas of the dairy industry may be created, offsetting the lost jobs milking cows. But AI is not a one-dimensional technology. It isn’t even a single piece of technology. It is a collection of technologies and methods for collecting and processing data that can be applied in numerous ways. It is not contained to a sole application. It is what’s known as a general-purpose technology. Other examples of general-purpose technologies are the internet, computers, and, most notably, the steam engine. General-purpose technologies cut across industries. They do not have a sole purpose but instead can be applied to an infinite number of tasks. They become productive forces that humans interact with, and leverage, to create and innovate. As it is a general-purpose technology, AI has the ability to disrupt countless industries at once. Where efficiencies in one area may have, at one time, resulted in new jobs in another, it is now possible that the other area will be experiencing the same efficiencies due to AI. Therefore, they may be creating some new jobs, but they will also be eliminating others. Although new jobs will be created to deal with AI, there is no certainty that they will replace all the jobs that are lost from the potential coming wave of automation. But scale is not the only problem with AI’s automation effects. Speed is also a major fear. AI developed in the shadows for a substantial period. Now that it has arrived in the mainstream, it seems to have entered with significant momentum, which means that it may hit countless segments of the economy fast and hard. Lots of people across industries may lose their jobs in a very short period of time. The creation of new jobs for the now unemployed workers will not happen as fast as the workers lose their jobs. In other words, if AI automation hits the job market hard and fast, we need to be prepared for a prolonged period between the layoffs and the emergence of new jobs. This period is likely to be both economically and mentally scarring for those who get caught in the middle. Sadly, this situation is not where the problems end. Again, even if we accept that new jobs will appear, and even if a miracle occurs and they appear jaw-droppingly fast, there is still a problem. The idea that new jobs will emerge brushes over the question of whether the new jobs will be appropriate for those who have lost their jobs. Not all jobs are the same. Due to the nature of AI, it is likely that it will heavily affect workers who are deemed to be “skilled workers.” This does not only mean people with a university education. It also includes those who perform tasks that traditionally require a large amount of acquired knowledge that is not common. This knowledge can be acquired through education or on-site experience. Workers are skilled because they have invested in themselves, acquiring this specialized knowledge. But now AI is able to acquire and act on the same knowledge. For many, massive investments they have made into acquiring knowledge and skills may be wiped out overnight. That doesn’t just mean financial investments in formal education but also years of practical work and experience that previously led to them being deemed skilled or valuable in the job market. The skills that will be needed for many of the new jobs that are created in a post–AI automation world will require fundamentally different skills to those which multiple generations have trained for. For many, massive investments they have made into acquiring knowledge and skills may be wiped out overnight. The skills gap that may be created could produce gigantic economic and social problems. Those who have their skills completely devalued by the economy will either need to retool or take low-skilled jobs. Low-skilled jobs will not be able to provide a standard of living or social status similar to what the previous jobs did. This downgrading will almost certainly lead to adverse mental effects and resentment of the system that betrayed these workers. That is doubly true for those who feel as if they did everything right. They did everything they were told to do to gain financial security, only to have it ripped out from under their feet. Imagine being forty-five years old with a young family and twenty-two years of work experience. Then, suddenly, you are told you need to start from the bottom. Your skills are no longer valuable. The further along you are in your career, the more devastating needing to retrain can be. However, it is not just those who are far along in their careers that are at risk. University education has long been positioned as the fastest and most efficient way to gain knowledge and skills that can set you apart. In countries such as the United States and Canada, students often take on substantial debt to fund their education. The rise of AI means that many skills taught at universities, especially in professional programs such as business, are being automated. This means that recent graduates may be saddled with massive amounts of debt for training that is now practically useless. For many, the option of retooling without specialized aid from the government will be impossible. Since they still need to eat, they will be forced to take a low-skilled job. Maybe they will be supervising a team of packing robots at an Amazon warehouse or cleaning rusty gears. Whatever they end up doing, the economic numbers will show them as being employed. But that is not the full story. Economic problems are often discussed in sterile terms. We talk about unemployment numbers and labour productivity. But it is so important to remember that behind each number is a person. That those numbers have souls, and that they love and are loved. How we as people experience the phenomenon of AI automation will affect us. It will shape our views and our values. The effects of automation can traumatize, demoralize, and even radicalize. And it is not just those who are economically displaced that are affected. Wealth inequality and economic despair affects us all. We do not live in an isolated society. What happens to your neighbours affects the world you live in too. Imagine being forty-five years old with twenty-two years of work experience. Then, suddenly, you need to start from the bottom. Moreover, financial struggles have massive effects on families. I was eleven years old when the great recession affected my family. For their privacy, I will shy away from the specific details. Yet I will be clear: I was deeply changed by what I experienced during that time. Even as my parents did their best to shield me, their youngest child, from what was happening, the effects were all too real. To be honest, that is one of the reasons I started researching AI. Although my work eventually strayed from examining the effects of AI on jobs, it is a topic that has always made me nervous. A storm is coming, and we need to prepare. We need to ask ourselves hard questions about what we want this transition to look like and make difficult choices about how we achieve it. And we need to do it fast. If there is one takeaway here, I hope it is this: even in a world dominated by machines, humans, and our decisions, are at the centre. Just as we build the machines and make decisions about how they are built, we build the systems that they are introduced into. We are not helpless bystanders when it comes to AI automation. We get to decide what the future of work looks like. We get to decide how we handle the great transition. A group who once understood this idea was the Luddites. They were skilled workers who became famous for destroying the new factory machinery that was automating their work. But the story of the Luddites is much more complicated than it is often made out to be. The Luddites were not anti-technology. In fact, many Luddites embraced the new technologies and were thrilled to work alongside them. What the Luddites feared was that their bosses would not use this technology to improve the products their customers received but to cheapen them, and that, at the same time, they’d gain more control over their workers. In the labour market, skilled workers have a lot of power. They can speak up for their rights and demand better conditions, because they are harder to replace. By contrast, unskilled workers are easily replaced or controlled. If the company’s desire is just to make money, unskilled workers are typically their preference. The factories that employed the Luddites could have functioned, and continued to make profits, without completely replacing their workers. Although they may not have needed every skilled worker they had before the automation, there were still opportunities to use the technology and pursue projects that required the skilled workers. At the end of the day, the battle the Luddites fought was one over economic and personal power. They were living through a transition similar to the one we are living through today, and they didn’t like the way it was being handled. They didn’t like the way technology was being used to cheapen production or the way it was devaluing those who worked with it and robbing them of the potential to take pride in their work by subjecting them to an existence as just another cog in a machine—a cog that could be thrown away by the powers that be if necessary. And they especially didn’t like the fact that the way these machines were being implemented was vesting massive amounts of social, economic, and political power into the hands of those who owned them. The Luddites were living through one of the last great societal transformations, the Industrial Revolution. There is no definitive start or end date for the Industrial Revolution. But it marks the period of human history when we completely transformed the ways we made things. Before the Industrial Revolution, we mostly made stuff by hand. Tools were used, but they were simple and needed to be wielded by someone who understood them. A large majority of the population worked as farmers, and they used their physical brawn and knowledge of the land to till the fields and feed the community. But then the Industrial Revolution began. New technologies such as the steam engine and water wheels made it possible to mechanize production. But the way production was mechanized was not set in stone. It was driven by human ideologies about how work should be done and what kind of work would lead to a better world. Ideas about cutting costs and increasing production led to increased de-skilling of work. As more machines were introduced, humans began to be treated more like machines. Jobs were divided into small repetitive tasks. Instead of constructing a whole shoe, a worker would spend their day making the same boot part hundreds of times, every day. The Industrial Revolution can be remembered through two competing images. On one side, it was the beginning of a gilded age. The machines of industry harnessed the productive force of society, and we began producing more goods than ever. We unlocked the potential of man and machine and built unthinkable wealth. It gave us the ability to provide more riches for everyone. But it was also a time of great suffering, when thousands were forced off their farms or pushed out of professions in which they had found deep meaning. Communities were shattered, and rural populations were forced into the slums of the cities to find work. With no skills, workers had little power and worked for pennies. Those who owned the factories hoarded vast wealth and understood the power their positions gave them. Corruption was rampant, and they worked hard to maintain their place at the top of the hierarchy. Children worked in factories and starved in the streets. But they were employed. Most members of society had jobs, but were they really living? It wasn’t uncommon to work ten to sixteen hours a day, six days a week, just to make ends meet. But it didn’t need to be this way. The future of work is not predetermined. It is up to us to decide how we navigate this uncharted territory. We as a society made choices about how the technology of the Industrial Revolution was to be used. We could have chosen a path that valued the worker and aimed to reduce suffering and distribute the benefits of increased production more evenly. Instead, we often chose efficiency and profit over human dignity and community. The story of the Industrial Revolution, like the story of the Luddites, is a reminder of the power of human agency in the face of technological change. It’s a cautionary tale that highlights the importance of making conscious choices about how we integrate new technologies into our society, ensuring that they serve to enhance human well-being rather than diminish it. As we stand on the brink of another transformative period, driven by AI, we are faced with similar choices. But this time, we have the past to learn from. We can see how the Industrial Revolution played out and ask, “Do we want to do that again?” Will we repeat the mistakes of the past, allowing technological progress to exacerbate inequality, displace workers without offering viable alternatives, and concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few? Or will we learn from history and steer this technological revolution in a direction that benefits all of society? The great transition we are undertaking is not just about the role of AI in the economy. It is not just about our jobs. It’s about who we decide we want to be. It’s about how we, as a society, choose to respond to the challenges and opportunities AI presents. It’s about the kind of world we want to live in and the values we want to guide us. The future of work is not predetermined. How we will live with AI is not etched in stone. It is up to us to decide how we navigate this uncharted territory, ensuring that the journey leads to a destination where technology serves humanity, and not the other way around.

Title: A ‘jobless profit boom’ has cemented a permanent loss in payrolls as AI displaces labor at a faster rate, strategist says

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Booming corporate earnings and a slumping labor market have been telling very different stories lately, and AI is the likely explanation, according to Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at Alpine Macro. That dichotomy is exemplified in the tech sector, which has seen profits soar while employment has been in a “recession” for three years, he said in a Monday note titled “A Jobless Profit Boom.” “We suspect that job losses in tech have been driven mainly by AI displacement,” Zhao added, pointing to recent cuts at Amazon, Meta and Salesforce. “These layoffs, however, are happening amid exceptionally strong profit growth in these companies—a significant departure from the past, when job cuts typically followed declining profitability.” This jobless profit boom isn’t limited to the tech sector and has quickly become an economy-wide phenomenon, he said. In fact, while overall private-sector payrolls have rebounded from the early days of COVID, it is still 5% below where the pre-pandemic trend would have been by this time. “In other words, there has been a permanent loss of jobs since the pandemic crisis, even as corporate profits have surged to record highs,” Zhao said. At the same time, productivity has been surging in recent years, and it is currently growing more than twice as fast as it did in the previous decade. Zhao thinks AI is the reason and noted the technology is displacing labor at an accelerating pace. But while labor demand is down, aging demographics and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown have weakened labor supply as well. Those trends have created a new equilibrium that are keeping a lid on unemployment even as hiring stays subdued. “Under normal circumstances, slower labor force growth should weigh on economic growth,” Zhao explained. “However, rising productivity has allowed the U.S. economy to produce more output—and higher profits—with fewer workers.” The analysis from Alpine Macro, which is part of Oxford Economics, reinforces what computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton has been saying about AI’s impact on the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon cancels Lord of the Rings MMO for the second time

The most widespread reaction I've seen to Amazon laying off 30,000 people from its gaming division has been "Amazon had a gaming division?" That isn't surprising in itself; none of Amazon Games' releases (mostly generic fantasy MMOs) ever came close to breaching the mainstream despite massive teams and functionally unlimited budget. We could speculate about why that is all day long, but regardless, Amazon Gaming's biggest shot at becoming a household name was its in-development Lord of the Rings MMO. The same one it just canceled for a second time. The project was killed the first time in 2021 before a turbulent restart, and then again just this week. A LinkedIn post made yesterday by a laid-off developer simultaneously announcing and cancelling the project has since been deleted, but the pertinent parts have been archived: The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she wrote. "It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here." Did some spiteful witch put a curse on The Lord of the Rings that keeps people from making good games based on it or something? It seems the only reasonable explanation. User ratings of New World, Amazon Games' biggest project, have fallen to "Mostly Negative" on Steam in the wake of these layoffs. It's unlikely Amazon will face any repercussions beyond this.

Title: OpenAI, Amazon sign $38bn AI deal
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/3/openai-amazon-sign-38bn-ai-deal
Time Published: 2025-11-03T18:13:50Z

The announcement comes less than week after Amazon laid off 14,000 people. By Andy Hirschfeld and Reuters Share Save OpenAI has signed a new deal valued at $38bn with Amazon that will allow the artificial intelligence giant to run AI workloads across Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. The seven-year deal announced on Monday is the first big AI push for the e-commerce giant after a restructuring last week. The new deal will give the ChatGPT maker access to thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its artificial intelligence models. Experts say this does not mean that it will allow OpenAI to train its model on websites hosted by AWS – which includes the websites of The New York Times, Reddit and United Airlines. “Running OpenAI training inside AWS doesn’t change their ability to scrape content from AWS-hosted websites [which they could already do for anything publicly readable]. This is strictly speaking about the economics of rent vs buy for GPU [graphics processing unit] capacity,” Joshua McKenty, CEO of the AI detection company PolyguardAI, told Al Jazeera. The deal is also a major vote of confidence for the e-commerce giant’s cloud unit, AWS, which some investors feared had fallen behind rivals Microsoft and Google in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Those fears were somewhat eased by the strong growth the business reported in the September quarter. OpenAI will begin using AWS immediately, with all planned capacity set to come online by the end of 2026 and room to expand further in 2027 and beyond. Amazon plans to roll out hundreds of thousands of chips, including Nvidia’s GB200 and GB300 AI accelerators, in data clusters built to power ChatGPT’s responses and train OpenAI’s next wave of models, the companies said. Amazon already offers OpenAI models on Amazon Bedrock, which offers multiple AI models for businesses using AWS. OpenAI’s sweeping restructuring last week moved it further away from its non-profit roots and also removed Microsoft’s first right to refusal to supply services in the new arrangement. Amazon’s announcement about an investment in AI comes only days after the company laid off 14,000 people despite CEO Andy Jassy’s comment in an earnings call on Thursday saying the layoffs were not driven by AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said the startup is committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources – enough to roughly power 25 million United States homes. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” said Altman. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” This comes amid growing concerns about the sheer amount of energy demand that AI data centres need to operate. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that AI data centres will use up to 12 percent of US electricity by 2028. An AP/NORC poll from October found that 41 percent of Americans are extremely concerned about AI’s impact on the environment, while another 30 percent say they are somewhat concerned as the industry increases its data centre footprint around the US. Surging valuations of AI companies and their massive spending commitments, which total more than $1 trillion for OpenAI, have raised fears that the AI boom may be turning into a bubble. OpenAI has already tapped Alphabet’s Google to supply it with cloud services, as Reuters reported in June. It also reportedly struck a deal to buy $300bn in computing power for about five years. While OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft, which the two forged in 2019, has helped push Microsoft to the top spot among its Big Tech peers in the AI race, both companies have been making moves recently to reduce reliance on each other. Neither OpenAI nor Amazon were immediately available for comment. On Wall Street, Amazon’s stock is surging on the news of the new deal. As of 11:15am in New York (16:15 GMT), it is up by 4.7 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Target Is Acting Like A Company Preparing For Acquisition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2025/11/03/target-is-acting-like-a-company-preparing-for-acquisition/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T17:56:26Z

ByChris Walton, Senior Contributor. Target and Amazon each announced layoffs on the same day last week. Tuesday, October 28th, to be exact. Coincidence? I think . . . it is more than likely. But what if it’s not? What if there is more at play here? What if it is a big tell that Amazon could be looking to acquire Target? Or, minimally, that Target is looking to get acquired itself? While this idea might sound crazy, there is more than enough chum in the water to give it credence. First of all, for years people have been hypothesizing that Target would make a great acquisition for Amazon. The first instance I can recall occurred way back in 2018 when Loup Venture’s Gene Munster predicted the e-commerce giant would buy Target. Obviously, that never happened, but ever since then too many pundits to count have encouraged the move, mainly because they all see a synergy with Whole Foods and Target. Newsflash: I do not, but more on that in just a few seconds. No, the far more strategic rationale for a Target acquisition plays right into what Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said late last week. In discussing the success Amazon has been seeing with the rollout of same-day perishable grocery delivery, Jassy said, “This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours.” Sound familiar? It should. Because it sounds exactly why people shop at Target, only the online version of the experience. If I had a nickel for every time someone during my Target career said to me, “I went in for one thing, and left with so much more!” I estimate that, give or take, I’d have about $5,325 by now. Target’s grocery experience has never been designed like Walmart’s or even Kroger’s. Target has never been the place where you can accomplish your full weekly grocery shopping trip. Sure, there are roughly 200 or so Super Targets throughout the country that approximate the Walmart Supercenter experience, but there are also about 1,800 other stores with a much smaller footprint of groceries, with no meat counter, no deli, etc. Said another way, Target has always been about the fill-in grocery trip. Smashing Whole Foods into Target for that reason alone would be a bad move. The stores don’t have the footprint and the retrofit would be quite costly. Second, Target’s supply chain design, i.e. the expansive use of sortation centers, was also designed by ex-Amazon and Target’s former Chief Supply Chain Officer, Arthur Valdez. It is a setup Amazon knows well and one to which Amazon could plug into quite nicely, and one that suddenly gives all its Amazon’s shoppers an “omnichannel” extension into the idea of buying (or picking up at a store) your “milk alongside your electronics.” But all that is just the Amazon side of the story. The recent happenings around Target’s CEO succession are so bizarre that they should give everyone pause, pause to ask, “What the heck is going on here?” For instance, Target’s outgoing CEO Brian Cornell’s track record is questionable at best (see why here), and instead of the board outright replacing him, it allowed Cornell to stay in his role until February 1, 2026 and named Target’s former COO Michael Fiddelke as his replacement, with Cornell then staying on as executive chair. Many, including Wall Street, were hoping the board would look outside for Cornell’s replacement, but instead it went internal and kept Cornell in the mix. Why would the board do this? Well, one reason could be that the board knows something we don’t and doesn’t want to upset the apple cart, an idea that deserves even more credence when we examine the layoffs last week. For all intents and purposes, last week’s layoffs were Fiddelke’s layoffs. Ever since Target announced its succession plan in late August, Fiddelke has been the public leadership face of Target. Knowing retail as I do, however, layoffs of this size and magnitude take months and months of planning, which also means that they had to have been in the works long before the succession announcement was made. All of which begs the next big question – why didn’t Cornell announce the layoffs and then hand over the reins to Fiddelke sometime afterward? Or even time the layoffs earlier? That would have been the move that set Fiddelke up for success. Instead Fiddelke gets saddled with the cultural impact of having to tell the organization that the reason for the layoffs was one of “too many layers and overlapping work slowing decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life,” a rationale that, as the former CFO and COO, Fiddelke had a big hand in creating. Is Fiddelke the right man to lead Target for the long-term, or is he just a temporary stopgap who understands the operations and who, with Cornell peering over his shoulder, can hold things in place until the right suitor comes along? If it is the latter, then Fiddelke is actually the ideal candidate to fulfill the role. He knows the internal workings of Target as well if not better than anyone still working there. If it is the former, then I don’t envy him one bit because Cornell handed him a raging dumpster fire, and it will take a superhero’s effort to bring the culture back and to fix the overall flailing business model at the same time. I asked Target for comment on all this speculation, both on the timing of the layoffs with Amazon as well as on the idea of Target’s leadership team preparing the company for acquisition, but my request for comment was not returned in time for publication. But then again, if any of the speculation were true, why would and, more importantly, how could Target comment? Target couldn’t comment even if it wanted to do so. No matter how one slices it, the situation is so strange at Target right now that, for the benefit of the doubt for all who still work there (Fiddelke included), one has to assume Target is clearing the decks for acquisition, right? What other possible explanation could there be? Because any answer beyond that gets really unsettling, really fast, and doesn’t inspire much confidence in what would result from the proverbial inmates left running the asylum, aka Target’s board and leadership team.

Title: The CEO Revolving Door Speeds Up
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceo/2025/11/03/the-ceo-revolving-door-speeds-up/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T17:12:49Z
Full Content:
ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. It’s a difficult time to be in business, and for many companies, the CEO’s position is becoming a revolving door. According to new data from executive search and leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates shared exclusively with Forbes, 174 global CEOs left their positions just in the quarter. Average CEO tenure declined to 7.2 years in Q3—down more than a year from the average 8.4-year tenure reported just two years ago. Russell Reynolds Associates notes that these results indicate a shift in board governance and investor activism—not necessarily stressed-out CEOs who want to get out of the hot seat. Boards and institutional investors are more closely monitoring CEO effectiveness, making changes earlier than they might have otherwise, and moving quickly if there are dips in company performance or strategic alignment. Many of those CEOs are being replaced by newcomers. Russell Reynolds Associates found that so far in 2025, 88% of new CEOs appointed globally are first-timers. This could be for several reasons, the firm said. Considering the multifaceted challenges of business today, boards may be seeking new perspectives in the CEO’s seat. Experienced CEOs also may also be voluntarily passing on another post, given the extreme scrutiny and pressure that come with the job. However, Russell Reynolds Associates noted, U.S. companies bucked the broader trend, reporting that more former CEOs returning to their previous roles to “steady the ship.” Globally, nearly three-quarters of new CEOs are internal hires. This trend is stronger among companies in the FTSE 100 and Nikkei 225, which saw almost all of their new CEOs moving up an internal succession ladder. U.S. companies made 69% of their hires internally. Russell Reynolds Associates wrote that this shows boards are balancing companies’ needs: whether institutional knowledge and company culture or an outsider’s viewpoint is what’s needed at the moment. Many companies quickly added AI to their call centers, but maybe it’s not the best way to answer often-angry customer calls. I talked to Sam Dorison, CEO and cofounder of ReflexAI, about his company, which uses AI to train the humans that are employed in call centers and why humans should still be working the phones. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The government shutdown continues, and is on track to be the longest ever if it keeps going until Tuesday. However, the big-picture economic costs of the shutdown are starting to surface for millions of Americans. Many more federal workers are missing paychecks and food benefits through the SNAP program have been suspended—though a judge has ordered the Trump Administration to tap emergency program funds to keep benefits flowing. The Congressional Budget Office reported last week that spending losses from the shutdown will cost the U.S. $7 billion to $14 billion in GDP so far. Meanwhile, the subsidy for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act has expired. Democrats have said Republicans’ failure to renew the subsidy is why they oppose reopening the government. Forbes senior contributor Joshua Cohen writes that without the subsidy, premium costs are rapidly increasing: up an average of 17% in states that run their own insurance exchanges, and an increase of 30% for states whose programs are managed by the federal government. Forbes senior contributor Bruce Japsen writes that companies that offered plans to millions of Americans through the Affordable Care Act are bracing for large losses of customers who can no longer afford coverage—like the two-thirds of customers UnitedHealthcare expects to lose. It’s little surprise that consumer confidence is continuing to drop, falling one point in October to a seven-month low of 94.6, according to the Conference Board. Actual data on the state of the economy is not readily available due to the government shutdown, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on CNN Sunday that he believes some sectors of the economy are either in recession or at risk of one. Bessent placed the blame on the Federal Reserve, which has slowly been rolling back interest rates—too slowly, in Bessent’s opinion. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates by a quarter point for the second month in a row, setting baselines at between 3.75% and 4%. But the decision itself was mixed—10 governors voted for the reduction and two against, with one opposed wanting a half-point cut and the other wanting rates to stay the same. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said another rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion, far from it.” Markets dropped following Powell’s statement, but largely recovered in the days since. Kimberly-Clark announced plans to acquire Tylenol parent company Kenvue for $48.7 billion in a cash and stock deal. This deal would make consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark the world’s second-largest seller of health and wellness products, creating a company with $32 billion in annual revenue. Kimberly-Clark has a wide portfolio of brands, including Kleenex, Huggies, Scott and Cottonelle. Kenvue was spun off of Johnson & Johnson in 2023 and comprised the pharmaceutical manufacturer’s consumer brands—including Tylenol, Aveeno, Band-Aid and Listerine. Kenvue has had a difficult autumn since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. issued a report in September claiming that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy is a cause of autism. Both Kenvue and many physicians and experts have refuted the report, saying it is based on weak and unproven evidence, and that Tylenol is safe for use during pregnancy, though President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on its claims, leading Texas to sue Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, claiming the companies deceptively marketed a risky drug to pregnant women. Prior to the acquisition announcement, Kenvue’s stock had fallen more than 22% since September. Today, its stock is up more than 16%, while Kimberly-Clark stock is down more than 12% after announcing the deal. Kimberly-Clark says the deal is expected to close in the second half of 2026. Online behemoth Amazon announced last week it’s laying off 14,000 corporate staff. Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post that the company is performing well but is seeking ways to “remove layers, increase ownership and realize efficiency gains.” This is just the beginning of big changes at Amazon because of AI. Forbes contributor Rachel Wells writes that internal strategy documents first reported on by the New York Times suggest that AI, robots and automation in general will replace 600,000 human jobs at the company by 2033. Wells writes that aside from administrative roles, the jobs most likely targeted by these layoffs include warehouse workers and order fulfillment operatives, as well as entry-level logistics, coding and customer service positions. Galetti’s blog post highlighted the disruptive nature of AI, noting its role in job losses. Forbes contributor Martine Paris points out that other big tech players have also cut positions this year, potentially due to new capabilities from AI. Microsoft’s headcount is down 15,000 employees, and Meta recently cut 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. Goldman Sachs has estimated that 6% to 7% of the U.S. workforce could be displaced by AI and automation, though several executives at the Paley International Council Summit in Silicon Valley late last month said the trajectory wouldn’t be just wholesale job cuts. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said the technology is inherently disruptive, but Microsoft is continuing to hire—though many of those hires are to train AI. A study from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and GBK Collective shows that many CEOs have the same outlook, saying AI will not shrink their workforce or job opportunities. Forbes senior contributor Joe McKendrick reports that fewer than two in 10 executives predict job cuts as a result of AI. In fact, 40% expect AI to boost hiring of entry-level jobs, and a third expect AI to increase executive-level hires. One of the first places many companies add AI is to their customer service call center. Sam Dorison, CEO and cofounder of ReflexAI, is bringing it there, but as a trainer—not replacing humans. Dorison said AI does a great job of handling repetitive tasks, and call center training tends to involve people going through the same simulations over and over again. I spoke with him about how he’s designed AI training and why humans are still needed in the call center. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. For your training, where do you get the data that makes the simulations work and rates how well calls are being responded to? Dorison: You do not need to use any real data to configure simulations. We want to be very clear that it’s our job to serve our customers, not for them to serve us [by uploading their data to our system]. We’ve invested very heavily in a lot behind the scenes. If you think about designing a car, no one needs to tell you that a car has four wheels. But the question is: How big are the wheels? What suspension do you need? Is it a convertible? Is it an SUV? Is it gas? Is it hybrid? Is it electric? As you’re putting together simulations within the platform, you have a huge number of choices and it’s structured for you. It’s not just: Build a car. Good luck. The reason that’s so important is that when someone’s calling a call center, they’re not just upset. Are they frustrated versus angry? Those are two very different emotions. Are they angry because they had one bad experience with your brand, or they’ve had a series of bad experiences? The way that you interact with a customer that’s had one bad experience, you can explain that you’re sorry and that this is a rare occurrence. They’ve had four bad experiences with you over the last month, don't bother explaining to them that it’s rare. All that’s going to do is make them more furious. We walk our customers through [the complexities] you’re designing: Who is the person calling? What’s the situation? How are they going to respond to different types of things that your agents might say? You walk through that process and by the end of it, seven minutes later, you have a simulation that you can deploy to hundreds of people that feels very realistic to your particular center. For the last several years, it’s been harder to talk to a person when you call a customer support line. And nowadays, more companies are adding AI agents instead of having a human for the vast majority of calls. Why do you see that humans should be the ones taking the calls? First and foremost, not everything should be talk-to-a-human. I want a very clear website that can explain it to me. I want a very effective app for some things. I’m fine if I call and I have AI on the other end, and for some things I want a human. If you look at long-term customer retention and satisfaction, you’re significantly better off having them talk to a human. Those [calls] can still be done more efficiently and better. The other thing I would say is that as you have seen and embraced the rise of AI agents, for the things that you do need to talk to a human to solve, the human had better be good at it. If you navigate a phone tree to get to a human, the last thing you want is a human who can’t quickly understand what’s going on for you and be able to solve it. What do you think CEOs need to know about tools like ReflexAI? You have to be clear about what you expect of your team with AI tools, and it can’t just be: Find ways to use AI in work. This means [defining] what are the types of metrics that you want to move? What are the risks that you're willing to incur? If you’re not clear about what risks are acceptable, it’s going to be hard for your team to get excited to incur any risk. Increasing your level of precision and clarity—both on the outcomes you care about and the risks that the organization is prepared to accept—is one thing. The second thing is you have to find a way to put it into performance reviews and hiring. If you don’t, you should not be surprised if you don’t get anywhere. That means not just having a question on performance reviews about innovation, but it means telling people on January 1 that in reviews on December 15, you will answer the question: How have you implemented new AI tools to improve business outcomes by at least X percent? Let people know they’re going to be evaluated against it, because that’s what people are looking for. They care about that, as well as care about the business outcomes. The third piece is: you have to look for partnerships, too. That the ability to reinvent the wheel with AI is basically 100%. You can spend all of your time solving problems that have already been solved. If every organization sets out to do the same thing over and over again, don’t be surprised when your organization is slower than someone else, or that you have higher costs, versus if you can find strategic partners. For us, what’s important is that we can say to our customers: The problems that you have, we’ve thought about across the country, with lots of different types of organizations. It’s similar to a CRM. You can physically build your own CRM. Any organization can build it, just throw software engineering money at it. But why are you building your own CRM in this day and age? AI tooling is a similar world. It’s certainly hard to find AI engineers, but why are you spending all this money on your internal team when you can very rapidly use something that’s there, and let your team get back to their actual work? There’s been a lot of controversy swirling around the decision to have Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny perform at next year’s Super Bowl, with many asking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to change the Big Game’s halftime headliner. Most CEOs face this type of dilemma—though they’re often much less publicized. Here are some takeaways from how Goodell is handling it so far. There’s a new person formerly known as Prince: King Charles III’s brother Andrew, who was formally stripped of his title last week due to his previous association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The monarch had to walk a tightrope to distance himself and the British throne from the scandal, and his decision-making process could be useful to CEOs navigating controversies brought on by others. Last week, the founders of which company became the youngest ever self-made tech billionaires? A. Mercor B. Bending Spoons C. AKOOL D. Dataiku See if you got the answer right here.

Title: Entering The Age of The Ozempic Company

ByStephen Miles, Contributor. For decades, a company’s success was largely measured by how many people it employed. The equation, growth equals headcount, defined an entire generation of business leadership from early-stage startups to Fortune 100 Companies. Adding employees was one of the key metrics that captured a company’s growth potential within its industry. The epicenter of this was in the technology sector, where founders and CEOs continuously talked about hyper-scaling through the lens of employee headcount expansion. This metric translated into the “hyper-scaling” narrative, which further translated into eye-watering valuations and market premiums. Headcount growth peaked during COVID, with many companies in the technology sector hiring as fast and furiously as their recruiting functions could handle. Employees in this era assumed significant power and asserted it through a total rejection of returning to the office (RTO), planting a firm flag on working from home indefinitely. Some went further, forming unions to collectively push back against company strategies and policies, including work with the Department of Defense, hybrid work models, and DE&I positions. The Year of Efficiency Post-COVID, we entered a new era highlighted by Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, announcing “the year of efficiency.” This marked a clear pivot away from headcount as a measure of hyper growth and a signal that trimming over-hiring and bloat would be the new mantra. Many founders and CEOs quickly followed, and we have seen a trend of high-performing companies continuing to announce reductions in their workforce, including Amazon, UPS, Target, Microsoft, and others. Historically, downsizing was viewed as a sign of weakness. In this new era, it has become a mark of discipline and strength, which also requires new leadership muscle from those still around. The old mindset held that a company grew its employee base and added spans and layers during prosperous times, only to shed them when conditions worsened. The new mindset is to run the company like an Olympic athlete, lean and efficient even in good times, with the goal of staying in top form year-round rather than letting bureaucracy creep in. The world we operate in has become less predictable, and the velocity of change has surpassed most executives’ wildest predictions. Leading a company that stays “fit” allows leaders to reduce bloat and bureaucracy, increasing the likelihood that the company can move faster and adapt better than its competitors. Entering the AI Era We are now entering the next phase, ushered in by the artificial intelligence revolution. We are still in the first chapter of this new era, and the true future of work and the corporation is yet to be defined. Across industries, leaders are converging on the same mindset. In my thirty years of coaching, this is the first time I have seen every CEO focused on running their company with fewer employees next year and beyond. The first chapter of this era has been less about front-page headlines of massive layoffs and more about stealth. CEOs are freezing headcount and putting real restrictions on hiring, allowing natural churn and attrition to reduce workforce size quietly. Most companies churn between 5 and 15 percent of their employees annually, and when you restrict rehiring, reductions happen without announcements. If you are a knowledge worker, you know what I mean. This is one of the hardest job markets ever for those looking to change roles or get hired. The competition is fierce, and openings are scarce outside of highly specialized roles such as AI. It is harder to get a new job than to get into an elite university, with thousands of applications for a handful of positions. Even the students from the most elite business schools are struggling to enter this job market. The AI Revolution and Its Reach The AI revolution has not even fully hit most companies yet. If you believe this is more like electricity than snake oil, it will transform the operating models and blueprints of every company and every employee. Apart from the internet, it is the only time a new technology truly touches everyone across an organization. Previous technological revolutions affected only small portions of the workforce. The database and cloud computing eras were largely handled by specialists and technology executives. AI, by contrast, reaches everyone, whether you are in a plant, on the front line, driving a truck, or working at corporate headquarters. Naysayers argue that new technologies take decades to fully integrate into the workforce. The difference this time is that everyone who owns a mobile phone (important to note that more phones exist than humans) already has access to AI. Most people have already experimented with ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude, often for fun or travel planning. Others have started using AI to increase productivity, eliminating repetitive work and focusing on higher-order problems. These employees are already differentiating themselves and will continue to pull ahead. As they make AI their personal superpower and become truly reflexive in its use, they will get noticed and likely elevated. At the employee level, we will enter a phase of “elevate or be disintermediated.” The future of being an employee is about higher density through elevated work or risk becoming irrelevant. The Risk of AI Slop This is not all doom and gloom. Every employee has the opportunity to make AI their superpower and, instead of being replaced by automation, use it to accelerate their growth. The challenge is that AI is still in its infancy and often confidently wrong. It is a tool to enhance productivity and eliminate low-value effort, not a place to dump your cognitive load and disengage. AI can help every employee become the highest-performing version of themselves, better, faster, and smarter, but it still requires human oversight. We have entered the era of “AI slop,” where employees risk lowering their potential if they treat AI as the answer rather than as an enhancer. The best employees will apply their cognition to higher-order problems, using AI’s speed to amplify their contextual thinking. Context Is the New Differentiator AI will dominate content creation, and its ability to synthesize and organize data is unmatched. Humans, however, are the best at context. The better you are at contextualizing a problem for an AI agent, the better the result you will get. As Tobi Lütke, the founder and CEO of Shopify, said on the ACQ2 podcast, it is not “prompt engineering,” it is “context engineering.” Employees who master context engineering faster will stand out early in this revolution. The way employees work will also change dramatically. For decades, many workers were measured by activity: meetings attended, insights generated, and presentations created. Accountability was cumulative, building through recurring meetings until someone finally made a decision. That model is dying. The premium on activities will decrease, perhaps to zero, as AI agents take on content assembly, allowing fewer, higher-density employees to focus on decisions and actions. What once took many meetings will soon happen in one or two. These high-density meetings will demand full cognitive engagement. Employees will need to re-learn how to have meaningful, high-accountability discussions. As recent CEOs have noted, leaders are pushing back against multitasking and texting in meetings. The future workplace will require attention, presence, and decisive ownership. Making the Case for Humans in an AI World As more routine and repetitive work is automated through AI, human factors will become the premium differentiators: leadership, relationships, trust, judgment, decision making, prioritization, and high-context communication. This comes at a time when years of isolation and remote work have dulled even the strongest interpersonal skills. Companies and employees alike must focus on two elements: making AI reflexive for every employee and strengthening human factors to turn enhanced content and higher-density collaboration into speed and execution. The companies and individuals that master both will define the true age of the Ozempic Company, lean, fast, and built to endure.

Title: Republican warns Trump now 'losing' on economy — and says it's 'going to get a lot worse'

As the government shutdown continues with millions of Americans losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and federal employees going without pay forcing many to turn to food banks, President Donald Trump's focus on foreign policy and building a ballroom is causing supporters and Republicans to question his priorities, according to NBC News. The shutdown, NBC reports, is compounding problems that have intensified "broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies — including Amazon and Target — and an uptick in inflation." Recent polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of the economy, with approval ratings generally falling in the range of 37 percent to 41 percent and disapproval ratings around 57 percent to 62 percent. His economic approval numbers are currently the lowest of his second term in office. Republicans, NBC says, are sounding the alarm about this "bleak" outlook, but are afraid to tell Trump the truth. “No one wants to tell the president he’s losing on the economy,” according to a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns. Despite that, some Republicans are still optimistic. Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) says that despite the numbers and the millions of Americans relying on food banks, "the state of the economy is very strong." NBC notes that many Republicans are intentionally remaining silent about the abysmal state of Trump's economy. "Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump’s economy," they note. Vice President JD Vance acknowledged the fact that Americans are suffering, but blames the Democrats despite Republicans having control of the House, the Senate and the White House. "The unfortunate reality — and we’re starting to see this with our aviation industry — we’re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vance said. Betty Szretter, a Republican and former Trump supporter who now regrets her vote and told NBC she will vote for a Democrat. blames the president. “I think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,” she said. “But now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.” “It all seems very selfish,” she added.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome back! Looking for something to watch? We have a new video podcast starring the great Katie Notopoulos and Emily Stewart. "Well Spent" covers how we buy, what we buy, and why we buy. Their first episode examines a doozy of a purchase: a home. Check it out here. In today's big story, people are getting nervous about layoffs. It could be time to start planning ahead. What's on deck: Markets: Looking to invest in the AI data-center boom? There's an ETF for that. Tech: How workers train Tesla's Optimus robot to act like a human. Business: Social media is becoming a lucrative new side hustle for some military personnel. But first, hope for the best but plan for the worst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Halloween has come and gone, but the labor market is still feeling spooky. Many workers see job security as a rarity these days. But instead of waiting for the proverbial axe to drop, some are getting ahead of layoffs in a variety of ways, writes BI's Jacob Zinkula. Sometimes it's as simple as getting a jump start on job hunting while you're still employed. Other people Jacob spoke to diversified their income with a side hustle or picked up a second full-time gig. While the approaches differed, the goal was the same: Don't get caught off-guard if cuts come. That's sound advice regardless of the job market, but it certainly holds true these days. The labor market has remained largely frozen for the past few months, with little to no hiring or firing. The slight thawing we have seen in recent weeks has been due to layoffs. There has also been a rise in rolling layoffs where companies make multiple, small cuts as opposed to a single deep one. The approach is meant to help companies avoid cutting too deeply, but it doesn't do much for employee morale. As if all of this wasn't nightmarish enough, don't forget the threat of AI. Companies seem keen to leverage the tech's efficiencies, which many interpret to mean lower headcounts. Some of you might be dismissive of these layoff preppers. "If you worked that hard on you're regular job, you wouldn't have to worry about getting laid off!" But layoffs aren't always telegraphed, and even in their aftermath, the reasoning isn't always clear. Take Amazon's recent job cuts. When the news was first announced, it was described as part of the company's goal to be leaner in the age of AI. One Amazon executive even encouraged employees in an internal memo to "lean in on AI." But just a few days later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs weren't AI-driven — "not right now at least," he added — and were instead about culture. So yes, maybe it doesn't hurt to be a bit proactive. And if you do end up getting bitten by the layoff bug, we've got you covered with what to do next. 1. This ETF could body the AI-data-center boom. The Tema Electrification ETF (VOLT) is poised to win big from the AI spending spree, according to analysts at Ned Davis Research. It's already beating the S&P 500, and analysts think it'll outperform the index by roughly 20% by 2027. 2. Leaving Wall Street for AI. When former Balyasny portfolio manager Barry Duong was under his noncompete period, he decided to learn about AI. Now, Duong leads AI strategy at startup Hebbia and thinks other Wall Streeters should also consider making the move. 3. How an "accidental banker" is running one of Wall Street's biggest deal machines. Houlihan Lokey CEO Scott Adelson told BI how the bank is positioning itself, from going on a hiring spree while rivals hold back to making targeted acquisitions. 1. What it's like to train Tesla's humanoid robot to be… human. Inside a glass-walled lab, dozens of Tesla workers act out the basic motions of everyday life — from wiping a table to lifting a cup — in an effort to train Optimus to move like a human. In conversations with BI, five current and former employees revealed what the job requires, including twerking, sprinting, and acting like a gorilla. One worker said that if their movements aren't deemed "human enough," their performance is critiqued. 2. AI, but make it have feelings. Eric Zelikman, a top AI researcher who recently left xAI, is raising $1 billion for his new startup at a $4 billion valuation, according to sources. Humans& will build models that attempt to learn from and empathize with their users. 3. Amazon's rollercoaster week. On Tuesday, mass layoffs shook the Big Tech company. By Thursday, Wall Street was cheering a strong Q3 earnings report. Behind all of this, CEO Andy Jassy has been focused on changing the company's culture and proving its AI chops, BI's Eugene Kim writes. 1. One of the biggest competitions in San Francisco is shockingly low-tech. Getting your ad on billboards (yes, billboards) has become an "insane competition." It's largely thanks to AI startups with cash to burn that are looking to stand out. In some areas, billboard space is sold out for the next year. 2. A soldier's foray into social media stardom. Since becoming a social media star, Sgt. 1st Class Johnny Vargas said he now earns more money online than through the Army. For BI's series on military influencer culture, Vargas said he's on a mission to help other service members cash in, too. 3. The C-suite's best career advice. The truth is that there isn't a clear path when it comes to climbing to the top. It's often dependent on timing, the industry, personal networks, and more. Executives shared with BI the best career advice that's stuck with them. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Good morning. Artificial intelligence is redefining the workplace, and corporate jobs aren’t excluded from its reach. During a panel session at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh last week, Anne Lim O’Brien, vice chair and partner at Heidrick & Struggles, said, “Professional services—lawyers, accountants, management consultants like myself—the ones who actually process, analyze, and deal with a lot of data, those are the skills that can be replaced by AI and agentic AI.” Hisham Radwan, CEO of Cigna Insurance Saudi Arabia and a fellow panelist, added actuaries to that growing list. “AI is moving so fast that we can’t control it,” Radwan said. “But bottom line—it’s an enhancement to our capabilities rather than a replacement.” As companies shift from the hype phase to the adoption phase of AI, they’re seeing productivity gains, O’Brien said. But she noted that companies must address a critical question: What are they doing with the time AI saves? For leaders, the promise of AI goes far beyond efficiency—it should free time for strategic thinking and innovation, she said. It’s also an opportunity to double down on skills like emotional intelligence, which is widely considered one of the core human abilities that AI cannot truly replace, she added. Tech giant Amazon’s approach is shaking up the corporate landscape. The company announced last week that it will cut roughly 14,000 corporate jobs—about 4% of its white-collar workforce, mostlymiddle managers—as part of a restructuring aimed at “reducing bureaucracy” and “removing organizational layers.” The company is offering “most employees” 90 days to look for a new role internally. For those who can’t find a new role or choose not to look for one, Amazon will provide severance pay, outplacement services, and health insurance benefits, among other measures, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience, wrote in the announcement to employees. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy said last year that he wants the company to operate like “the world’s largest startup” and to have the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership. During the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Jassy said the layoffs were about a cultural mismatch, not primarily financial, Fortune reported. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven—not right now, at least,” Jassy said of the job cuts. “It’s culture.” However, Amazon’s job cuts follow a company-wide email in June, in which Jassy wrote that those who embrace generative AI and help build Amazon’s capabilities will have the most impact and assist in reinventing the company. Fortune’s Eva Roytburg highlights that Galetti mentioned in the company memo that this generation of AI is a “transformative technology” and that the company needs to be organized more leanly—with fewer layers and more ownership—to move as quickly as possible. “The move may offer an early glimpse of how AI is actually reshaping the labor force: not by immediately displacing the tactile, mundane factory roles everyone expected, but by hollowing out the white-collar ranks that run them,” Roytburg writes. Gartner analysts estimate that by 2026, one in five organizations could use AI to estimate at least half of their management layers. AI may not necessarily take your job—but someone who knows how to use AI better than you might, O’Brien warned during the panel session in Riyadh. The takeaway: upskilling and reskilling aren’t just for those in non-corporate positions—they’re essential at every level of the organization. What’s helping you keep your AI skills sharp? I’d love to hear from you—send me an email. SherylEstradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Elias Habayeb, CFO of Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE: CRBG), has resigned to accept a senior leadership position with a publicly listed company. Habayeb will remain in his current position until April 24, 2026. Habayeb’s departure is not the result of any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to its financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, operations, policies or practices. Corebridge is working with an executive recruiting firm to launch a search for a successor. Cassandra Hudson was appointed CFO of Alkami Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALKT), a digital sales and service platform provider, effective November 1. Hudson brings more than 20 years of experience. Most recently, she served as CFO of StackAdapt. Before that, she was CFO of EngageSmart, where she guided the company through a successful IPO in 2021. Earlier in her career, Hudson spent 12 years at Carbonite in a series of finance leadership roles, ultimately serving as chief accounting officer and VP of finance. Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) Global M&A Report 2025 shows global deal value rose 10% to $1.9 trillion through Q3, driven by North America, which accounted for 62% of deals ($1.3 trillion, up 26% year over year). Seasoned acquirers—using proven playbooks and increasingly, AI—achieved a two-year average return of +1.0%, while less experienced buyers saw –7.5%. Despite challenges like geopolitical tensions and shifting tariffs, many dealmakers continue to move forward, particularly in small- and mid-cap markets, where regional transactions have been more insulated from disruptions, according to BCG. Strategic growth, capability building, and resilience remain key drivers. North America is the top region by value, and technology leads among industries. Leading firms now embed AI throughout diligence, valuation, and integration, accelerating decision-making and risk management. Megadeals are rebounding, with 27 transactions over $10 billion this year (up from 21 last year). Sector standouts include industrials (+77%), tech (+10%), energy (+20%), and health care (+20%). "Stock futures climb as investors await Supreme Court showdown on Trump tariffs and shareholder vote on Musk’s $1 trillion pay package" is a Fortune report by Jason Ma. From the report: "Markets signaled another positive session as futures rose Sunday night ahead of a big week for President Donald Trump’s tariffs and Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s blockbuster compensation plan. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 107 points, or 0.22%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.28%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.30%. That would add to Friday’s rally." "The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 1.8 basis points to 4.083%. The U.S. dollar was up 0.06% against the euro and up 0.16% against the yen." You can read more here. "Successful organizations treat tech debt like financial debt, managing it proactively with a strong digital core, agility and a culture of continuous improvement." —Daniel Kendzior, the global cybersecurity AI reinvention leader for Accenture, writes in a Fortune opinion piece titled, "The haunting consequences of ignoring tech debt in an agentic AI world."

Title: Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks The fingerprints of artificial intelligence are all over mass layoffs and downsizing at Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, YouTube and other major companies, raising fears of an AI-fueled jobs wipeout for white-collar workers. AI may hurt demand for office workers, but there’s reason for hope, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes. The dynamic American workforce will evolve, as it has in the past, Solomon told CNN during a sit-down interview. Solomon, speaking from the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, cited the disruption caused by the invention in the late 1700s of the steam engine, which helped fuel the first industrial revolution. “There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.” Of course, that adjustment process can be difficult – especially for the workers whose careers have been sidelined by new technology. A key difference this time is the explosive speed at which AI is being embraced by businesses – and how rapidly AI itself is advancing. A Goldman Sachs survey of bankers found that 37% of clients are using AI for regular production, with adoption expected to hit 50% next year and 74% in the next three years. ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and now boasts 800 million weekly active users. Its parent company OpenAI is reportedly laying the groundwork for an IPO that could value it at up to $1 trillion. Today’s AI chatbots can do deep research, generate stunningly realistic films, compose music and instantly flag financial fraud before it can even get completed. That speed could make the transition bumpier this time around. “The pace of adoption of this technology is going a little bit faster. As businesses wrestle with deploying the technology and the automation, the short-term disruption might be a little bit higher,” the Goldman Sachs CEO said. “But our economy is incredibly broad and nimble.” Office workers may be especially exposed to that disruption. Although Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company’s recent 14,000 layoffs were “not even really AI driven,” he said in June that adopting generative AI and AI agents will shrink the company’s corporate workforce. Meta recently cut 600 roles within its AI team, which reports have indicated is part of an effort to move more nimbly. YouTube this week began offering voluntary buyouts to US employees as part of an AI-focused restructuring. Workers at Chegg, an online education company, are being hurt by AI on two fronts. First, the rise of ChatGPT is lowering demand for Chegg’s education services. Secondly, Chegg itself is investing in AI, promising to run its business leaner with fewer workers to compete. This week Chegg said it will slash nearly half its workforce as it grapples with the “new realities of AI” and lower search traffic. AI was cited as a reason for 17,375 layoff announcements this year tracked by outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas through the end of September. That represents less than 2% of the total layoffs announced this year. However, Challenger noted that this tally likely undershoots AI-linked layoffs. Another 20,219 job cuts announced during that period were tied to companies citing unspecified technological updates – some of which could be related to AI. “The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they’ll be picked up in other parts of the economy,” said Solomon. By contrast, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of entry-level jobs in white-collar professions, lifting the unemployment rate to up to 20% in the near future. “It’s eerie the extent to which the broader public and politicians, legislators, I don’t think, are fully aware of what’s going on,” Amodei told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in May. “We have to act now. We can’t just sleepwalk into it.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during a press conference that a “significant number of companies” are either doing layoffs or saying they won’t hire much in part because of AI. “We’re watching that very carefully…It could absolutely have implications for job creation,” Powell said. A survey of over 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers finds that just 11% of US companies are “actively reducing headcount due to AI,” a report published last week said. However, that figure rises to 31% for tech, media and telecom companies. Goldman Sachs bankers expect AI will lead to “modest headcount reductions” of 4% over the next year. But that number could rise to 11% over the next three years – especially in customer service jobs. Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote that the findings support the bank’s view that AI will have a “transformative impact on the labor market and economy,” and that rapid adoption signals that “AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected.” The AI boom has also raised worries about a bubble forming in this red-hot part of the market. Solomon said that while many “great companies” will be formed during the AI boom, at some point the exuberance could get overdone and it won’t be a “straight line up” in value. One scenario he laid out is that demand for AI services may at some point fail to reach lofty expectations, driving valuations down. But that process could take time to play out because, as Solomon noted, most public tech companies are well-established and the newer AI companies are largely still in private markets, where valuation markdowns only change slowly. “The technology is exciting – there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.” – CNN’s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.

Every time Bonnie publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here's the reality in 2025: you can lose your job with no warning. I've worked in tech for the past four years, and during that time, I've witnessed thousands of layoffs and reorganizations. I have friends who have been laid off two to three times in a single year. One day, you're happily employed, the next, you can't log into Slack, your key card no longer works, and you open your personal email to see an email from HR informing you that you're no longer employed. This week, Amazon announced that it will lay off up to 30,000 employees this year, and 14,000 have been let go already. Whether you were affected by the layoffs at Amazon or you feel your job at another company could be at risk, there are things you can do if you suspect layoffs could be coming your way. My recommendation is that you make this a standard practice every month or two. A year from now, it may be hard to remember who that colleague was who told you that you were the best project manager they ever worked with. Keep track of those networks now. Record the names and contact info of colleagues you've worked with, along with a few notes on how you worked together. Connect on LinkedIn as well. Should you be laid off, you now have people you can reach out to for references or introductions to opportunities within their networks. Screenshot a shoutout from an executive and download performance reviews. You can use this to help you think through examples for interviews, and it can even serve as motivation and a reminder of your impact. You'll want these data points for your résumé and interviews, and saving them along the way will make it much easier than having to hunt them down once you've left your workplace. Some job applications require you to share a portfolio or samples of your work. You could also be asked to do some sort of project as part of the interview process. Save this info now rather than scrambling to have people send it to you after a layoff. Many of us use our work emails for work-related accounts, such as LinkedIn. Make sure you add a personal email address as well — this will be helpful for accessing these accounts should you be laid off. Otherwise, you could be locked out. You can always update these after a layoff, but if you make a habit of updating them regularly, it will be far easier to kick off your job search than if this becomes another task that you have to take on during a time of stress. If you have already been laid off, give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. Layoffs are traumatic, and you will need time to recover before starting your job search. Aside from looking for a new role, there are a few things you should add to your to-do list. This can take weeks to kick in, so prioritize this as one of your first steps. Make sure you understand the details of your severance package. There may be requirements to receive your full package, or it may be more beneficial to negotiate some portions. Many service providers have programs for those who are unemployed — you may be able to get a forbearance on student loans, a pause on car loans or your mortgage, or some relief on your interest rates for a credit card. You never know if you don't ask. Consider what expenses you can eliminate. Unemployment will not replace your full salary, so cutting back on subscriptions, streaming services, etc., might help your money go further. Write a post on LinkedIn to share your update with your professional network, and also ensure that your friends and extended community are aware. Most people probably don't know what you do, but if you share a bit about job titles and industries that are a good match and let them know you're seeking referrals, they may be able to help as well. Many find that a job search can take more than six months in 2025, so the more you're able to prepare yourself, the better your chances are of navigating that period successfully. Jump to

Title: With Trump's focus elsewhere, the economy shows signs of trouble

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time For Hannah Szretter, the government shutdown is more than just a political fight. The 26-year-old Buffalo-area resident said she has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 10 and also now has a mental health disorder that prevents her from working. The $300 she receives each month in food assistance from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been a needed lifeline to make sure she is able to maintain her blood sugar level. “I need these benefits for my food. If I don’t get the food, I won’t be able to control my numbers,” she told NBC News. “If you don’t get it taken care of, you can lose toes or limbs, or could go blind.” Now she is among the more than 40 million people who may not receive their November SNAP benefits as the government shutdown goes into its sixth week with no end in sight. “It’s scary,” she said. Trump's attention, however, was elsewhere, this weekend. Just hours before these food assistance benefits were set to lapse, President Donald Trump hosted a lavish "Great Gatsby"-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago, with the theme: "A little party never killed nobody." And on Friday, he posted dozens of photos on social media about his fancy renovation of the Lincoln bathroom in the White House. Along with the loss of SNAP benefits and the disruption of other social service programs for millions of people, the government shutdown has resulted in federal employees going without pay. Many of them have turned to food banks and unemployment benefits to get by. Hannah’s mom, Betty, a 63-year-old recent retiree who is a caretaker for her daughter and a longtime Trump supporter, said she is losing confidence in the president she once supported amid the shutdown fight. “I think deep down he wants to help the country with things like food insecurity,” she said. “But now he is busy out of the country and demolishing the White House. I know that is being paid for with private funds, but those could be used to help people.” “It all seems very selfish,” she added. Betty Szretter said she now regrets voting for Trump in 2024 and would prefer a Democrat in the White House to “protect benefits he [Trump] wants to cut.” The shutdown is compounding problems that have intensified broader anxiety over an economy that in recent months has been marked by lingering high prices for many consumer goods, rough jobs numbers, mass layoffs at major companies — including Amazon and Target — and an uptick in inflation. That stagnation has in recent months eroded the high approval marks President Donald Trump once enjoyed on the economy. The bleak picture has some Republicans sounding the alarm to the White House — even though delivering the news isn’t easy. “No one wants to tell the president he’s losing on the economy,” said a Republican strategist who said they recently warned the White House about their concerns. Trump’s overall approval rating sits at 43%, while just 34% of registered voters say he has “lived up” to expectations on the economy, 33% say he has “looked out for the middle class” and 30% say he met expectations on inflation, according to a new NBC News poll released Sunday. A White House official blamed Democrats for the prolonged shutdown and argued that some indicators, like growing wages and a booming stock market, are proof the economy has bright spots. The person also argued that the massive tax cuts and tariffs pursued by Trump are going to take time to fully take effect. “I don’t think anyone is under any illusions that things are perfect … but looking at the data, we feel good about the trajectory here,” said the White House official, who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “The bottom line is that the actual buying power and actual purchasing power of American consumers is going up, and, as far as specific prices go, you know there are things like gas and eggs that have gone down,” the official said. They also asserted that Trump’s pursuit of investment in the U.S. will pay major dividends in the future for American workers and consumers. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and Trump ally, said in an interview with NBC News that he remains optimistic about the economy. “The state of the economy is very strong, if you look at real wages that continue to go up,” Moreno said. “The Working Families Tax Cut Act worked really well. ... The big thing is, obviously, the Democrats don’t want the economy to be successful, which is decently sad considering they should be cheering for the American people. But they shut down the government because they want Trump to fail.” Republicans are pushing for the passage of a “continuing resolution,” which would extend current funding levels until Nov. 21. Democrats, meanwhile, want to include an extension of tax credits that help people buy private insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Those credits expire at the end of the year, and without the extension, millions of people who receive them are likely to see steep premium increases. Republicans have argued the health care fight should be handled separately, after the government reopens. For his part, Trump for weeks has largely been focused on issues aside from the shutdown and economic concerns, with the exception of deals around his tariffs. Democrats have called on him to become more engaged to help end the stalemate. On Tuesday night, Trump did write on social media that Senate Republicans should use the “nuclear option” to get rid of the filibuster. The drastic move would allow Republicans to reopen the government without needing 60 votes — and the cooperation of Democrats — but it was swiftly rejected by Republican leaders. Last week, Trump’s attention was in Asia, far from the pain of the shutdown, with a big announcement on tariffs. Before that, much of his focus was on demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors, a project that is ongoing. And on Thursday, a reporter asked Vice President JD Vance about the loss of SNAP benefits, and whether the administration was working to find a funding solution, as it has tried to do to pay troops and law enforcement during the shutdown. Vance avoided answering whether there would be a push around SNAP, instead blaming Democrats. “The unfortunate reality — and we’re starting to see this with our aviation industry — we’re going to find out the hard way with SNAP benefits, the American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vance said. Some relief could be coming — but if it does, it’s over the Trump administration’s objections. On Friday, a federal judge ordered the administration to distribute money to SNAP recipients “as soon as possible” by tapping a contingency fund. Another federal judge in a separate case also said it was unlawful for the administration not to pay out the benefits. The White House has argued that it cannot use those funds and is seeking further clarification from the courts. Several recent public polls have pointed to Trump having an economic problem, one that is quickly turning into a political one for Republicans trying to maintain slim majorities in the House and Senate headed into the 2026 midterms — an election where Republicans will have to energize Trump voters without his presence on the ballot. The new NBC News poll found Republicans have just a 1-point advantage over Democrats on “dealing with the economy,” a margin that has consistently been 15-20 points in favor of Republicans going back to 2018. Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego’s winning campaign in Arizona last year, said that economic hardship gives his party’s candidates an opening to win key segments of the electorate — including the young men who helped Trump take back the White House — if they focus on making the argument that their policies are better than the president’s. “Right now, people’s prices are going up. Their prices are going up for the utility bills, going up for lots of things in their life, because of the tariffs,” Rocha said. “If you show up and start talking to folks about actually trying to provide for their family, there’s going to be a lot of men who right now feel a little regret because they were promised lower prices and they’re not getting them.” Moreno said he was not worried “about the politics” of the shutdown, noting that he has pledged to serve no more than two Senate terms and, as a native of Colombia, is constitutionally ineligible to be president. But he said Republicans need to better articulate their message: that they hold Democrats responsible for the shutdown and its economic ramifications. He specifically alluded to recent remarks from House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who in an interview with Fox News acknowledged that families would “suffer” because of the shutdown but emphasized that Democrats needed to exert their political “leverage” to address health care costs. “We’ve got to speak up more loudly and more aggressively, like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune did the other day. I think we haven’t shown enough outrage. We do it privately, but we haven’t done it enough publicly. Just call these guys out. It’s disgusting,” Moreno said. “We need to speak clearly, with humanity, not political talk,” he added. Trump remains popular with Republicans on things like immigration enforcement — Betty Szretter says she still supports the president on that issue — but pocketbook issues more often than not have an outsize role in swaying election outcomes. The NBC News poll found 83% of registered voters said the “cost of living” was their single most important issue or very important to them, a number that was at 58% when they were asked about “immigration and border security.” On the Asia trip last week, Trump nevertheless told reporters he had the “highest [poll] numbers I ever had.” He has also directly avoided questions about the economy. “Let’s just make it about this subject,” Trump said at an event centered around an autism announcement last month. “I’d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.” Republicans running in swing House seats across the country, however, have not been eager to talk about Trump’s economy. NBC News reached out to eight Republicans either defending swing seats they currently hold or challenging Democrats in winnable seats; seven did not return requests seeking comment. Brinker Harding is a Republican city councilman in Omaha running to replace Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is not seeking re-election in one of the most up-for-grab seats in the country. Harding said he believes that once the midterm campaigns really begin, moves Trump has made will have the economy in a better place. “Come next November, Republicans’ tax cuts for working families and small businesses, in addition to projected interest rate cuts, will have the American economy moving more than it already is,” he said. Other swing state Republicans where vulnerable Democrats are on the ballot are pinning economic woes on those Democrats. “Maine’s issues are especially pronounced on the economic front,” said Lauren LePage, who is the Republican national committeewoman from Maine. “And the blame for our high cost of living, nation-leading electricity price increases and more lies at the feet of Democrats here.” Maine is home to one of the nation’s most closely watched 2026 Senate contests as Democrats try to knock off Republican Sen. Susan Collins. LePage’s father, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, is himself running to challenge Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, in a House seat that is considered winnable for either party. Other Republicans, including some former Trump allies, are acknowledging that prices have remained stubbornly high during Trump’s second term in office. “Prices have not come down at all,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on “The Tim Dillon Show” last week. “The job market is extremely difficult. Wages have not gone up.” She has also made an uncharacteristic pivot in recent weeks. After being one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, she has been critical of the president and her own party of late, agreeing with Democrats that the Affordable Care Act tax credits should be included as part of any deal to reopen the government. “When it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums, I think that’s unforgivable,” she told NBC News in early October. For people like Betty Szretter, they just want the fight to be over and the focus to return to Americans hurting in the current economic climate. “I would say practice what you preach and save the country as a true servant,” she said when asked what she would say to Trump directly. “There are not a lot of people who use their wealth to actually help others. Really no one.” Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida. Jonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News. Henry J.

Title: Changing the AI narrative from liberation to acceleration

by Tom Johnson on Nov 3, 2025 categories: ai The most frequent story told about AI is that it will free us up from mundane tasks and allow us to focus on more impactful, strategic work. But the liberation part of that story might be misleading. In this post, I argue that AI's true effect is to accelerate the entire competitive landscape, increasing the pace of work for everyone. In this new, sped-up world, companies that replace human workers with AI for short-term gains, assuming that the pace of change is static, may find themselves falling behind in the long term. Introduction The AI narrative Hard limits to velocity Increasing speed means risking more error A world sped up A new AI narrative Introduction There’s a pretty depressing post on the techwriting subreddit right now: AWS tech writers majorly impacted by today’s layoffs … with nearly 968 likes and 94 comments to date. In the post, one of the former AWS tech writers writes: … it doesn’t matter that AI can’t do everything we do. It doesn’t matter that the quality is noticeably worse than our writing. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t know all the overhead and confusing internal systems that we use to get our docs out the door. Corporate leadership doesn’t care about any of those things. They will give you AI tools, train “you” to use them (it’s really the other way around - you’re training it), tell you that it’ll make your life easier, and still let you go in the end. It’s a sobering thread that has many in the industry upset, and understandably so. The post prompted me to think about the larger AI narrative that often gets told, and how that narrative might be misleading. The current AI story is only partly true, and damaging in the way it can mislead. Laying off employees in response to AI could be a short-sighted strategy based on a static pace fallacy, which is the assumption that the amount of work is fixed. In reality, AI accelerates the entire competitive landscape, increasing the overall pace of work. Moreover, AI shifts the bottleneck from content generation to human validation. Companies will need their human workers, augmented by AI, to manage this new, higher-volume validation bottleneck and keep from falling behind. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. The AI narrative The AI narrative, if there is a general one, goes something like this: AI is going to make you so productive, you can do 3x as much and free up time for more strategic, important tasks that AI can’t do. I frequently hear professionals noting how AI allowed them to do tasks that might normally take a long afternoon of tedious work. CEOs probably hear this and think AI will allow us to do the same with one third the number of employees. As a result, you’ve seen the flat hiring and the increased pace at which tech writers are working. However, this thinking (reducing employees because AI can do their work) commits the static pace fallacy — the assumption that the total volume of work and competitive expectations are fixed, rather than dynamic and accelerating. Here’s what most people overlook in the AI liberation narrative: If AI speeds up your productivity, it speeds up the productivity of everyone around you too. And every company in your domain. And companies abroad. So those other companies will also deliver faster, with higher quality, and more prolifically if they’re also using AI. Here’s an analogy for this argument. Consider the computer’s effect on writing. Let’s say you, a tech writer working in 1990, get a computer, learn to type, and realize that you can write a lot faster and easier using this tool. It even doubles your productivity versus writing by longhand with a pen. It’s amazing. For the first few months, your productivity soars because not many other writers have computers, and it’s become your secret weapon. Whereas with pen and paper you might have written 1 document a week, with a computer you now produce 3 documents a week. However, within the year all the other writers have computers too and are using them to match the same increased levels of productivity. Pretty soon everyone else is also producing 3 documents a week. Now AI comes along and wow, it’s another leap in speeding up technical documentation. As an early adopter you figure out the tools, the prompting techniques, and how to integrate AI into your workflows. You’re no longer producing 3 documents a week — you’re creating 5 documents a week. For the first few months, you’re ahead of everyone else because some writers are slow to learn new tools and processes. But before long, the other writers also figure out AI, get access to the complex reasoning models, and learn how to integrate them into their workflows. Everyone is now generating 5 documents a week. Now consider that AI is speeding up the roles of everyone around you too — developers, product managers, lawyers, customer support, partner engineers. Everyone has ratcheted up their productivity a couple of notches. Because speed is relative, any early advantage you might have had in using AI to produce more documentation is negated as the entire system accelerates. The number of requests simply increases to fill the new capacity. The net result is that although your productivity is 5x as much, your workload is 5x greater too. Whereas before you supported 1 software team pushing out a major release quarterly, now you support 3 software teams pushing out major releases monthly. Now come back to this idea that AI tools will liberate you from tedious work and free you up to focus on more impactful, strategic work. That “free time” never unfolds like you think it does because the workload just increases all around. I might not be spending 3 hours formatting entries in an HTML table and troubleshooting rendering errors. But I’m also not seeing my bug queue slim down and my bandwidth open up to tackle more strategic issues. I simply have 3x as many doc tickets coming in. The net result of AI is to speed everything up. This increased speed is that breathless feeling almost everyone has experienced lately. Hardly a week goes by that you’re not inundated with announcements about new AI tools, integrations, techniques, events, training, and more. This has led to AI fatigue. It’s exhausting. The most recent figure to promote the idea of acceleration is Ray Kurzweil and his idea of the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), as he argues in The Singularity Is Nearer. His argument is that technology’s pace increases, in part, because it’s generating a feedback loop of tools that allow for increased development. AI gives rise to more builder tools: it’s a tool that builds other tools, which allows you to create more and more products easier and faster. Think about the invention of the engine, or electricity, or the internet — these innovations enable new capabilities/inventions across domains. Kurzweil says the Internet, an invention with feedback loops to expand more technology and new businesses, doubled labor productivity for a decade. If the Internet gave rise to new industries, professions, companies, economies, etc., imagine what AI will give rise to. Will AI double or quadruple labor productivity? If so, won’t that accelerate the pace of innovation in the corporate landscape? The time between major inventions is undeniably shrinking. Simply go to Timeline of historic inventions and scroll down; notice the timelines shrinking between major inventions. For more recent inventions, see List of emerging technologies. Kevin Kelly also makes the acceleration argument beautifully in What Technology Wants, noting how 100 years ago, the number of items in your house was considerably less than now. Technology innovation has led to abundance. While a precise metric for innovation (for example, a way to quantify the pace as a number) is difficult to capture, the trend is clear: 2,000 years ago, there might have been 1 major invention every 50 years. Today, significant inventions seem to appear every 1 year or sooner. The timespan just keeps shrinking. If the pace is accelerating, companies need all the resources they have just to keep up. By replacing human workers with AI, they risk losing the speed needed to run at the faster clip that others are moving at. For example, let’s say that pushing out one major feature a month per software team was the norm in 2025, but in 2027, the company is expected to push out 3 major features a month just to keep pace with an increased speed across the tech landscape. In 2030, you need to release a major new feature each week in your software product. By 2035, your product will practically need to be perfect and perform miracles to move past competitors in the market. In a state of accelerating change, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better tools, they’ll be eclipsed by those who can. If CEOs operate with a mindset that thinning their employees will yield more profits because they can accomplish the same output with two-thirds the number of people, that commits the fallacy of thinking that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The competitive environment is intensifying. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. How will companies keep up? If a small, nimble company can release a disruptive innovation overnight, they can quickly eclipse the incumbent companies. Maybe in the short term, a company like Amazon can lay off large numbers of tech workers and it won’t matter for a while. But think 3-5 years down the line. Will the same company have the tech resources to keep their competitive edge in a landscape that is accelerating with faster releases, speeding up their development cycles to release new features and products more frequently? If the race is getting faster, a company that chooses to reduce the power of its engine will slow down. Hard limits to velocity A counterargument might be that an existing tech writer’s output will grow commensurately with technological innovation. For example, in 3-5 years, the same tech writer who was producing 5 documents a week will produce 10. That might be partly true. However, the idea that a reduced body of employees will commensurately keep pace with accelerating industry change seems unlikely. This is because there are some hard limits to speed that happen even when you apply AI as much as possible. AI’s speed is mostly with content generation, not content validation. As a result, you end up with a lot of generated content, but the validation processes (the human in the loop to review and check the AI output for errors) aren’t moving at the same speed. This is something I’m wrestling with in the bug zero series that I’ve been writing about. Theoretically, AI should allow me to reduce my doc issues from 40 tickets to 0 tickets. However, I’m not seeing how to use AI in a way that would allow me to achieve that level of speed. I want to, for sure. Often when I turn around someone’s large doc request in record speed, they give me a peer bonus. I feel like a laggard when their requests sit for weeks or months in my queue. Why can’t I speed up my documentation writing velocity to clear out the doc queue? Two reasons. First, because the requests are coming in at a faster clip (tech is accelerating). And second, because although AI speeds up content generation, it doesn’t speed up the validation process — the review and verification, along with issue tracking and work management. Even the simplest task, like fixing a broken link, demonstrates this acceleration ceiling. While AI might help identify or fix the link itself (perhaps it’s a tricky Javadoc package reference), that single step is a fraction of the total work, which includes the following: Create a bug in our ticketing system. Identify the source file containing the error. Make the updates to the content. Create a changelist with the updated file. Identify the SME reviewer who has ownership of the directory. Describe the update in the changelist. Stage the changelist and provide a preview link. Ping the SME to review the changelist. Address any comments from the SMEs. Pass any presubmit tests for the changelist. Wait for the SME to approve the changelist. Submit the changelist. Verify that the changelist correctly propagated into production. Describe the update in release notes. Relay the update in internal reports. Maybe a smarter AI system could automate all these steps. In fact, I plan to try to tackle each one and see how it might be automated. But such automation is difficult. For example, automated reminder messages sent to SMEs are likely to be ignored. Automated changelist descriptions might correctly itemize what’s changed, but without more context the descriptions might fail to communicate the “why” behind the changes. One approach to breaking through the acceleration ceiling is to incorporate smarter error checking tools at key points in the workflow. We already have some in place, and I’ve also introduced my own custom checkpoints. When I submit a changelist, Gemini looks over the file changes to see if the changes match the bug, examines configuration errors or other problems in the changes, and flags any issues to fix. This is usually helpful and more often than not catches issues I miss. I also use my own verification on content by asking Gemini to check the content against the API reference. This usually works well too, though I frequently run up against token constraints due to the size of the APIs, along with needle-in-the-haystack findability problems. Also, it doesn’t make sense to check every CL against the API (such as the link fix CL), so there’s a human judgment call here about which verifications are needed for which content updates. Even with AI assisting the validation process, there are many workflow process steps that can’t be sped up, so each ticket has its own bandwidth constraints regardless of the AI involved in the content generation and verification. This means there’s a ceiling to expected velocity gains. Maybe 7 documents a week is that ceiling. Any attempts to go beyond that speed, such as by reducing the review time or reducing reviewers, means accepting a greater risk of error. Increasing speed means risking more error Going faster means risking more error. It’s like driving a car: If you’re going 20 mph, your risk of collision is low. Go 120 mph, though, and a crash is almost certain. This is where a company starts to incur “productivity debt”: borrowing time by cutting corners on validation, only to pay it back with interest later in the form of rework. Even consider a small doc update that contains an error. When you float this doc update to engineers to review, they won’t approve the changelist due to the error (assuming they catch it). The error can trigger a whole cascade of back-and-forth discussions/interactions on the changelist. You have to look at their comments and interpret them, update your content, resubmit it for review, and so on. Errors slow everything down. It’s even worse if the error slips by reviewers and makes it into production. Now partners might see the errors and communicate them to field engineers, and so on. Every error reduces trust in the documentation and your professional capabilities. So errors aren’t good. Taking time up front to eliminate errors (the validation process that bottlenecks AI’s speedy content generation) actually speeds up the pace of documentation overall. How do you speed up without allowing for greater risk of errors? Let’s assume the pace has really picked up so that each tech writer is publishing not 10 but 100 documents a week. Now you really have less time to diligently review each change. You might only have time to quickly skim incoming changelists to review, hoping that the updates are right. You’d need to trust the AI output more because you don’t have time to test or verify it against a source of truth. You hope that reviewing engineers will do the validation, but they too are sped up. They’re probably relying on the same AI tools to check the content that you already used, creating a dangerous validation loop where no human is actually performing the primary check. A world sped up To recap my argument, yes, AI can accelerate our output, but it won’t liberate us. AI is accelerating everyone’s output. Not just you and your colleagues’ output. It’s accelerating the output from your competition, both nationally and internationally. The world has sped up. In a state of accelerated innovation, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better products, they’ll be eclipsed by companies that can. If CEOs thin their number of employees, thinking it will yield more profits, that short-term thinking commits the fallacy of assuming that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. Expectations about quality are increasing. You have to spend more time in research and development to ensure the competitor’s next release doesn’t put you out of business. This is why company layoffs might be a strategically poor decision: in an attempt to capture short-term profits, they shed the human validation resources needed to compete in the long-term, accelerated race. A new AI narrative Returning to the original idea of this post, what should the AI narrative be? Instead of this liberation narrative: AI does the tedious tasks so you focus on more strategic work. it could be: AI provides tools to speed up your work in a constantly accelerating environment. But no one likes acceleration as a goal here. We’re all accelerating and reeling from its effects. The idea of AI as liberation — liberation from all the tedious and time-consuming tasks you have to do — sounds much more appealing. But that liberation is a false narrative. AI isn’t liberating us. It’s speeding up the race. And we’re out of breath. About Tom Johnson I'm an API technical writer based in the Seattle area.

Companies will need their human workers, augmented by AI, to manage this new, higher-volume validation bottleneck and keep from falling behind. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. The AI narrative, if there is a general one, goes something like this: AI is going to make you so productive, you can do 3x as much and free up time for more strategic, important tasks that AI can’t do. I frequently hear professionals noting how AI allowed them to do tasks that might normally take a long afternoon of tedious work. CEOs probably hear this and think AI will allow us to do the same with one third the number of employees. As a result, you’ve seen the flat hiring and the increased pace at which tech writers are working. However, this thinking (reducing employees because AI can do their work) commits the static pace fallacy — the assumption that the total volume of work and competitive expectations are fixed, rather than dynamic and accelerating. Here’s what most people overlook in the AI liberation narrative: If AI speeds up your productivity, it speeds up the productivity of everyone around you too. And every company in your domain. And companies abroad. So those other companies will also deliver faster, with higher quality, and more prolifically if they’re also using AI. Here’s an analogy for this argument. Consider the computer’s effect on writing. Let’s say you, a tech writer working in 1990, get a computer, learn to type, and realize that you can write a lot faster and easier using this tool. It even doubles your productivity versus writing by longhand with a pen. It’s amazing. For the first few months, your productivity soars because not many other writers have computers, and it’s become your secret weapon. Whereas with pen and paper you might have written 1 document a week, with a computer you now produce 3 documents a week. However, within the year all the other writers have computers too and are using them to match the same increased levels of productivity. Pretty soon everyone else is also producing 3 documents a week. Now AI comes along and wow, it’s another leap in speeding up technical documentation. As an early adopter you figure out the tools, the prompting techniques, and how to integrate AI into your workflows. You’re no longer producing 3 documents a week — you’re creating 5 documents a week. For the first few months, you’re ahead of everyone else because some writers are slow to learn new tools and processes. But before long, the other writers also figure out AI, get access to the complex reasoning models, and learn how to integrate them into their workflows. Everyone is now generating 5 documents a week. Now consider that AI is speeding up the roles of everyone around you too — developers, product managers, lawyers, customer support, partner engineers. Everyone has ratcheted up their productivity a couple of notches. Because speed is relative, any early advantage you might have had in using AI to produce more documentation is negated as the entire system accelerates. The number of requests simply increases to fill the new capacity. The net result is that although your productivity is 5x as much, your workload is 5x greater too. Whereas before you supported 1 software team pushing out a major release quarterly, now you support 3 software teams pushing out major releases monthly. Now come back to this idea that AI tools will liberate you from tedious work and free you up to focus on more impactful, strategic work. That “free time” never unfolds like you think it does because the workload just increases all around. I might not be spending 3 hours formatting entries in an HTML table and troubleshooting rendering errors. But I’m also not seeing my bug queue slim down and my bandwidth open up to tackle more strategic issues. I simply have 3x as many doc tickets coming in. The net result of AI is to speed everything up. This increased speed is that breathless feeling almost everyone has experienced lately. Hardly a week goes by that you’re not inundated with announcements about new AI tools, integrations, techniques, events, training, and more. This has led to AI fatigue. It’s exhausting. The most recent figure to promote the idea of acceleration is Ray Kurzweil and his idea of the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR), as he argues in The Singularity Is Nearer. His argument is that technology’s pace increases, in part, because it’s generating a feedback loop of tools that allow for increased development. AI gives rise to more builder tools: it’s a tool that builds other tools, which allows you to create more and more products easier and faster. Think about the invention of the engine, or electricity, or the internet — these innovations enable new capabilities/inventions across domains. Kurzweil says the Internet, an invention with feedback loops to expand more technology and new businesses, doubled labor productivity for a decade. If the Internet gave rise to new industries, professions, companies, economies, etc., imagine what AI will give rise to. Will AI double or quadruple labor productivity? If so, won’t that accelerate the pace of innovation in the corporate landscape? The time between major inventions is undeniably shrinking. Simply go to Timeline of historic inventions and scroll down; notice the timelines shrinking between major inventions. For more recent inventions, see List of emerging technologies. Kevin Kelly also makes the acceleration argument beautifully in What Technology Wants, noting how 100 years ago, the number of items in your house was considerably less than now. Technology innovation has led to abundance. While a precise metric for innovation (for example, a way to quantify the pace as a number) is difficult to capture, the trend is clear: 2,000 years ago, there might have been 1 major invention every 50 years. Today, significant inventions seem to appear every 1 year or sooner. The timespan just keeps shrinking. If the pace is accelerating, companies need all the resources they have just to keep up. By replacing human workers with AI, they risk losing the speed needed to run at the faster clip that others are moving at. For example, let’s say that pushing out one major feature a month per software team was the norm in 2025, but in 2027, the company is expected to push out 3 major features a month just to keep pace with an increased speed across the tech landscape. In 2030, you need to release a major new feature each week in your software product. By 2035, your product will practically need to be perfect and perform miracles to move past competitors in the market. In a state of accelerating change, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better tools, they’ll be eclipsed by those who can. If CEOs operate with a mindset that thinning their employees will yield more profits because they can accomplish the same output with two-thirds the number of people, that commits the fallacy of thinking that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The competitive environment is intensifying. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. How will companies keep up? If a small, nimble company can release a disruptive innovation overnight, they can quickly eclipse the incumbent companies. Maybe in the short term, a company like Amazon can lay off large numbers of tech workers and it won’t matter for a while. But think 3-5 years down the line. Will the same company have the tech resources to keep their competitive edge in a landscape that is accelerating with faster releases, speeding up their development cycles to release new features and products more frequently? If the race is getting faster, a company that chooses to reduce the power of its engine will slow down. A counterargument might be that an existing tech writer’s output will grow commensurately with technological innovation. For example, in 3-5 years, the same tech writer who was producing 5 documents a week will produce 10. That might be partly true. However, the idea that a reduced body of employees will commensurately keep pace with accelerating industry change seems unlikely. This is because there are some hard limits to speed that happen even when you apply AI as much as possible. AI’s speed is mostly with content generation, not content validation. As a result, you end up with a lot of generated content, but the validation processes (the human in the loop to review and check the AI output for errors) aren’t moving at the same speed. This is something I’m wrestling with in the bug zero series that I’ve been writing about. Theoretically, AI should allow me to reduce my doc issues from 40 tickets to 0 tickets. However, I’m not seeing how to use AI in a way that would allow me to achieve that level of speed. I want to, for sure. Often when I turn around someone’s large doc request in record speed, they give me a peer bonus. I feel like a laggard when their requests sit for weeks or months in my queue. Why can’t I speed up my documentation writing velocity to clear out the doc queue? Two reasons. First, because the requests are coming in at a faster clip (tech is accelerating). And second, because although AI speeds up content generation, it doesn’t speed up the validation process — the review and verification, along with issue tracking and work management. Even the simplest task, like fixing a broken link, demonstrates this acceleration ceiling. While AI might help identify or fix the link itself (perhaps it’s a tricky Javadoc package reference), that single step is a fraction of the total work, which includes the following: Maybe a smarter AI system could automate all these steps. In fact, I plan to try to tackle each one and see how it might be automated. But such automation is difficult. For example, automated reminder messages sent to SMEs are likely to be ignored. Automated changelist descriptions might correctly itemize what’s changed, but without more context the descriptions might fail to communicate the “why” behind the changes. One approach to breaking through the acceleration ceiling is to incorporate smarter error checking tools at key points in the workflow. We already have some in place, and I’ve also introduced my own custom checkpoints. When I submit a changelist, Gemini looks over the file changes to see if the changes match the bug, examines configuration errors or other problems in the changes, and flags any issues to fix. This is usually helpful and more often than not catches issues I miss. I also use my own verification on content by asking Gemini to check the content against the API reference. This usually works well too, though I frequently run up against token constraints due to the size of the APIs, along with needle-in-the-haystack findability problems. Also, it doesn’t make sense to check every CL against the API (such as the link fix CL), so there’s a human judgment call here about which verifications are needed for which content updates. Even with AI assisting the validation process, there are many workflow process steps that can’t be sped up, so each ticket has its own bandwidth constraints regardless of the AI involved in the content generation and verification. This means there’s a ceiling to expected velocity gains. Maybe 7 documents a week is that ceiling. Any attempts to go beyond that speed, such as by reducing the review time or reducing reviewers, means accepting a greater risk of error. Going faster means risking more error. It’s like driving a car: If you’re going 20 mph, your risk of collision is low. Go 120 mph, though, and a crash is almost certain. This is where a company starts to incur “productivity debt”: borrowing time by cutting corners on validation, only to pay it back with interest later in the form of rework. Even consider a small doc update that contains an error. When you float this doc update to engineers to review, they won’t approve the changelist due to the error (assuming they catch it). The error can trigger a whole cascade of back-and-forth discussions/interactions on the changelist. You have to look at their comments and interpret them, update your content, resubmit it for review, and so on. Errors slow everything down. It’s even worse if the error slips by reviewers and makes it into production. Now partners might see the errors and communicate them to field engineers, and so on. Every error reduces trust in the documentation and your professional capabilities. So errors aren’t good. Taking time up front to eliminate errors (the validation process that bottlenecks AI’s speedy content generation) actually speeds up the pace of documentation overall. How do you speed up without allowing for greater risk of errors? Let’s assume the pace has really picked up so that each tech writer is publishing not 10 but 100 documents a week. Now you really have less time to diligently review each change. You might only have time to quickly skim incoming changelists to review, hoping that the updates are right. You’d need to trust the AI output more because you don’t have time to test or verify it against a source of truth. You hope that reviewing engineers will do the validation, but they too are sped up. They’re probably relying on the same AI tools to check the content that you already used, creating a dangerous validation loop where no human is actually performing the primary check. To recap my argument, yes, AI can accelerate our output, but it won’t liberate us. AI is accelerating everyone’s output. Not just you and your colleagues’ output. It’s accelerating the output from your competition, both nationally and internationally. The world has sped up. In a state of accelerated innovation, we need AI tools just to keep our head above water. If your company can’t push out new and better products, they’ll be eclipsed by companies that can. If CEOs thin their number of employees, thinking it will yield more profits, that short-term thinking commits the fallacy of assuming that the goal posts are staying in the same position. The release windows in which you must push out new software are shortening and becoming more frequent. Expectations about quality are increasing. You have to spend more time in research and development to ensure the competitor’s next release doesn’t put you out of business. This is why company layoffs might be a strategically poor decision: in an attempt to capture short-term profits, they shed the human validation resources needed to compete in the long-term, accelerated race. Returning to the original idea of this post, what should the AI narrative be? Instead of this liberation narrative: AI does the tedious tasks so you focus on more strategic work. it could be: AI provides tools to speed up your work in a constantly accelerating environment. But no one likes acceleration as a goal here. We’re all accelerating and reeling from its effects. The idea of AI as liberation — liberation from all the tedious and time-consuming tasks you have to do — sounds much more appealing. But that liberation is a false narrative. AI isn’t liberating us. It’s speeding up the race. And we’re out of breath. I'm an API technical writer based in the Seattle area.

Title: Millions of Americans to go back to the polls - sort of

Sean Whelan Washington Correspondent They are at it again. It is election time in the US, so tomorrow - barely a year since Donald Trump won the presidency and Congress (just about), it is back to the voting booths for millions of Americans. Most will be voting in local elections, but there are four electoral contests that have national significance - two statewide polls that test to some extent the popularity of the president's agenda and performance, one referendum that could alter the arithmetic in Congress in next year's midterm elections, and one local election contest that tells us something about the current state of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has been stumbling, shellshocked and aimless, through the charred rubble of its own post-electoral hellscape and all four elections will tell us about the current state of the party. The Democrats badly need some winners, and are spending big in search of morale boosting victories. They are helped by history, with electoral records showing that the party of the president tends to lose these odd-year elections more than win them and in Donald Trump they have a president who is, shall we say, motivating? The governor's races are being held in New Jersey and Virginia with the state legislatures - House and Senate - also up for election. So it is a full on general election at state level in two prosperous north eastern states, where the Trump factor is playing a role in what is quite tight electoral arithmetic. So what it tells us about Americans' real feelings about the first year of the Trump administration is significant - because it is an actual poll not an opinion poll. But then again it is only two states, so lots of caveats apply in trying to stretch interpretations to fit a national picture. Still, they are important national political barometers, falling as they do half-way between the presidential election and the midterms - they are sort of the "midterms of the midterms". The polling information suggests the Democrats will win both governorships, and should retain control of the State House in Trenton, New Jersey's unloved capital. (On a visit to the state house some years ago I asked a staffer where was a good place to get lunch. "Pennsylvania", he replied, nodding in the direction of the river that marked the state lines). Though the Democrats' lead in the polls is not as solid as it should be in such a blue state, so the political nerds will be watching this one closest of all tomorrow’s electoral contests. The 100-seat Virginia House is also a tight affair, with the Republicans needing just three gains to take back control. However, the current government shutdown may tip sentiment against them as northern Virginia is home to the greatest concentration of federal government employees, who are either furloughed, fired or working without pay. Either way, that is a lot of unhappy voters (and a possible reason for the federal budget standoff not to be resolved before the votes are in the boxes). In both states, the Democrats have plumped for the centre ground as their battleground, the party primaries picking candidates with broad appeal to middle America. In both states, the Democrat candidates are women, both with military or intelligence service backgrounds, who got elected to the US Congress in 2018 and made a name for themselves as part of the new centrists in a party that is often defined by the rhetoric of its leftist extremities (especially by its Republican rival). Both Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy officer and helicopter pilot, and Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, stood out as militantly moderate in the last several congresses. Along with another ex-CIA staffer Elissa Slotkin, they were known to some as the "mod squad", in contrast to the better known 'Squad" of left wingers, led by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC), the New York representative. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib back up AOC in forming the furthest left bit of the Democrats in Congress. Neither of the candidates are out to change the world - at least not in the governor’s mansions. They believe that the first rule of politics is winning elections, so both are campaigning on the things that bother ordinary Americans most - the cost of housing, food and medical care as well as the cost of everything else for that matter. The affordability crisis is their best political tailwind. For Ms Spanberger, the president’s tariffs are giving her some traction with some of Virginia’s farmers - soybean farmers in particular stretched on the rack by China in retaliation: last week's apparent deal in Korea could not have come soon enough for them. In the northern - and richest - end of the state, the Federal layoffs help motivate Democratic voters (the Pentagon, CIA headquarters at Langley and the FBI academy at Quantico just three of the vast array of government agencies in the state). The prospect of AI driven layoffs in the state's very large high tech workforce (Google and Amazon both have huge operations, nestled among the prairie-sized data centres that extend south from the Potomac River) may also help. As does the general term "chaos", used by Ms Spanberger and several other speakers at a campaign event we went to last week in Alexandria (not far from George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon). Virginia is the only state of the old Confederacy that Donald Trump did not win in the presidential election last year (the state capital, Richmond, was also the capital of the Confederacy). The outgoing Governor, Glenn Youngkin, a successful financier with the Carlyle Group, benefitted from Joe Biden being the incumbent when his election was held. His Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears is running as the Republican candidate, but is not doing well with attack ads claiming she is too right wing for MAGA. Read the latest US stories Ms Earle-Sears, an immigrant from Jamaica who served in the US Marines, looks and sounds much less establishment than Ms Spanberger. That might be part of her undoing in Virginia, at least this time around. And although the Democrats attack her as MAGA, she has a Trump problem: he thinks she is a "phoney". That is because she said in 2022 that he should not run for president again. He has not backed her in this election as a result. Whatever the result, Virginia will get its first female Governor since 1776. President Trump has backed the New Jersey Republican candidate all the way from the primary that cleared the way for Jack Ciattarelli to go again, having narrowly lost in 2021. The polls indicate another narrow loss is on the cards, as the navy pilot-turned lawyer-turned moderate Democrat politician Mikie Sherrill has a narrow lead. The race has been tight enough considering New Jersey is historically a blue state, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost two to one. However, the president has inadvertently given Ms Sherrill a helping hand in one of his early responses to the government shutdown: promising to hit back against Democrat controlled states he pulled $18 billion in Federal funding from a badly needed new railway tunnel linking New Jersey with New York city. That's just enraged New Jersey commuters, some 200,000 of whom head into the Big Apple to earn their daily bread. As a result of railing against the pulled railway funding, Ms Sherrill hardly has to mention the president and his wider policies at all. The other big campaign issue is, like Ms Spanberger, the cost of living crisis. In particular, the cost of electricity for New Jerseyans, which has skyrocketed since the summer. She is promising to take a page from the president's playbook and declare a state of emergency to stop utility companies jacking up the price as rapidly as consumers (there is a deeper financing issue that defies easy soundbite politics, but that is for after the election). There are also plenty of municipal elections taking place in cities and counties across America. The big cities are the ones that count, and of the top 100 cities in the US, 27 have mayoral elections this year - eight of those jobs have already been filled. However, tomorrow sees 19 races in a list of big cities that pretty much reads like the places that have an NFL franchise in them. But only one of them is getting any attention in America. And internationally. There are many reasons why New York is exceptional, both as a city and as a concentration of media organisations with global reach. However, why should anyone outside of the Tri-State area know who the Mayor of New York city is? Be honest - do you know who the Mayor of Dublin is? Yet the name Zohran Mamdani is known everywhere. This is a testimony to the political marketing skills of the 34-year-old member of the New York State House, who shocked the Democratic Party hierarchy earlier this year when he won the party primary to become the Democratic Party Candidate for mayor. And in this heavily Democrat voting city, winning the primary is as good as winning the election itself. Not that Mr Mamdani is taking anything for granted, running a high energy campaign that has stunned many observers of what is generally regarded as conventional wisdom. The New York mayoral contest is the latest installment in the picaresque political opera that is city hall politics in Gotham. The incumbent Mayor, Eric Adams, was a Democrat until he was charged with taking a bribe from the Turkish government to facilitate planning permission for a new Turkish consulate building. He had to resign from the Democrats, but was pardoned by President Trump. He then stood for re-election as an independent. The Democrats sought a new candidate, which opened the door for the former Governor of New York State, to contest the primary. His father was also the governor, and the perception was he would cruise to the nomination. But time had passed him by - he had to resign as governor back in 2021 because of a string of allegations of inappropriate behaviour from female workers in the governors mansion. He had denied all impropriety and fought back, although acknowledging that standards of behaviour have changed over the decades. Enter Mr Mamdani from stage left. Peddling an unlikely US politics combination of pro-Palestine, far left (by US standards) ideas like free public transport, rent control, a massive public housebuilding drive and low cost childcare - all paid for by taxing the rich, he outflanked Andrew Cuomo and secured the nomination. Mr Cuomo had stood as an independent as well. Mr Trump pressed Eric Adams to drop out of the race (reportedly with offers of a job in the administration - in the meantime the former cop is onside with the Trump law and order agenda). The actual Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, is a no hoper - the red beret wearing founder of the Guardian Angels subway patrol group has been accused by some of using the platform to promote his own talk radio show. Mr Trump would prefer if Mr Sliwa quit the race too to give Mr Cuomo a chance to become the stop the Democratic candidate. But despite financial backing from the billionaire class - including a reputed $8.5 million from former Mayor Mike Bloomberg - Mr Cuomo is struggling to cut through: not a Republican, tarnished as a Democrat, totally out of touch with the grinding daily concerns of young New Yorkers. They want someone - anyone - to do something about the cost of living in the city. Never a cheap place, prices for housing in particular are stratospheric. Affordable, available housing is the cry of young people and the modestly paid in cities all over the Western world. Especially in those successful big cities that suck in young talent from all over the globe. Their daily struggles contrast with the almost unbelievable wealth of the mega-rich in Manhattan, and their well-heeled servants on Wall Street. So Mr Mamdani - a proudly proclaimed "democratic socialist", is on track to be the mayor of the world’s most capitalist city. A Muslim, he is outspoken on Palestine and in his criticism of Israel and is winning in the city with the most Jews in the world other than Tel Aviv. As French philosopher and public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy wrote of the apparent success of someone who does not give wholehearted support to the state of Israel in the Wall Street Journal at the weekend : "If New York falls, the entire free world may again totter on its foundations." Which may explain why there is so much attention on this particular mayor's race. What does it tell us about the Democratic Party? Is the Mamdani way the new way for the Democrats to win? Probably not. What works in New York will not work in New Mexico but it could further bolster the far left as a faction in the party. Success for Mr Mamdani could encourage AOC to have a go at current Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who faces a primary vote ahead of next year's midterms, when his seat is up for election again. If 36-year-old AOC replaced the 74-year-old, it would position her to be the leading left wing voice in the Senate, leaving 83-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders free to contemplate slowing down a bit (Mr Sanders is the only politician apart from the president who can pretty well expect to fill stadium-sized speaking engagements around the country: he has been on a nationwide speaking tour with AOC). Mr Trump of course is playing his part, calling Mr Mamdani a communist, and threatening to cut off federal money to the city. Mr Cuomo isn’t throwing in the towel just yet either, placing hope in older voters coming out to vote and younger voters doing anything except voting. So the Democrats could come out of the election looking like they have over the past few years - split. The likely victories for moderates in the governor elections balance the likely victory of Mr Mamdani in the mayor's race. Winning, but not setting a decisive course for the party in the years ahead: the Democratic Party brand is still up for grabs. Of course in real politics, governors are way more important than mayors - they even have their own armies in the form of the National Guard. Mr Mamdani only has the NYPD - a force he has a tetchy relationship with and being seen as soft on crime is a serious impediment for many Democratic Party politicians around the country. And while neither Virginia nor New Jersey could be described a national bellwethers - places that mimic the characteristics of the typical American community - their farmland and endless suburbs are a lot more representative than New York City, a place which is quintessentially urban and mentally closer to European style social democracy than anywhere else in America. It is absolutely atypical. So beware the Mr Mamdani hype when it comes to prognostications about the future of the Democratic party. The biggest lesson for the party establishment is not a new one either: beware of the primary elections - the ones where only the hard core party activists come out to vote (the same is true on the Republican side, hence the MAGA capture of that party). As for the fourth electoral test, this is a referendum in California to authorise a Gerrymander to give the Democrats more seats in next year's midterm elections to the US House of Representatives. The referendum on Proposition 50, to be correct about it, was called by Democratic Party Governor Gavin Newsom. He wants to do a Gerrymander in this already heavily Democrat voting state to bring about the near obliteration of the Republican Party representation in the lower house of Congress. Why? Because Texas Governor Greg Abbott is doing a Gerrymander in Texas to slash the number of Democrat seats and boost the number of Republicans the Lone Star state sends to DC. Other Republican led states are also looking at Gerrymandering the maps ahead of next year's primaries - a normal practice here ever since Governor Elbridge Gerry signed off on the first dodgy redistricting in Massachusetts in 1812 (the local rag, the Boston Gazette, ran a cartoon with Gerry's face drawn onto a Salamander, dubbing the slimy creature a Gerrymander - boy did that one stick!). The California Gerrymander is controversial - not just because it could see the 39% vote share the Republicans get in America's most populous state translate into just four seats out of the 52 that California gets in the House of Representatives (down from nine at the moment). The former Republican governor of California and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger has been back on TV shows in recent weeks arguing voters should terminate Prop 50 on grounds of democracy. As governor he brought in the law that Prop 50 is supposed to overthrow - having an independent electoral commission draw up the electoral maps, not highly partisan politicians. But with Republicans going into next year's midterm congressional elections with the narrowest majority in the House in a hundred years, they are scrambling to counteract the normal drop of 20 seats that all incumbent ruling parties seem to face at midterms. That would see control of the House pass to the Democrats, throwing a big spanner in the legislative works of the Trump administration - hence the rush to get as much done before November of next year. So yes, these are local elections. It is not about Trump. It is all about Trump. Washington Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Target layoffs hit almost all corners of the business, from merchants to engineers
URL: http://digiday.com/marketing/target-layoffs-hit-almost-all-corners-of-the-business-from-merchants-to-engineers/
Time Published: 2025-11-03T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit The story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail Target’s widespread corporate layoffs this week trimmed down teams throughout the company, leaving some who remain picking up responsibilities from those affected. The layoffs included employees spanning across engineering, product design, analytics, guest experience, creative, strategy, merchandising, HR, operations and legal, according to a Modern Retail analysis of around 60 posts from Target employees who posted on LinkedIn this week looking for work, as well as posts from remaining employees. Employees of the Minneapolis-based retailer were informed Tuesday whether or not their positions had been affected. The company decided to cut around 1,000 team members and to not fill an additional 800 open roles, a Target spokesperson confirmed to Modern Retail. Those impacted will continue to receive pay and benefits until Jan. 3, in addition to severance packages. The move is expected to have a noticeable impact on the workloads and sentiment of those who remain with the company. It will also leave hundreds of people — some had been with the company for decades — without work at the tail end of an economically challenging year. Now, Target faces the tall task of rebuilding morale at a time when the company has faced macroeconomic and geopolitical hurdles, criticism over its pullback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, several underwhelming quarters, and an expectation of a low-single digit decline in sales this fiscal year. The Target spokesperson said the change impacted leadership roles at about three times the rate of individual contributors. Minneapolis was home to many of the affected workers, though some in other cities and in India were also laid off. No roles in stores or warehouses were affected, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to share exact numbers on how many employees in each city lost their jobs, though the company filed two Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) letters with the state of Minnesota detailing at least 500 jobs lost in downtown Minneapolis and 287 at its Brooklyn Park offices. Just a few examples of the 1,000 people leaving the company, according to their profiles, include a senior product manager who had worked on collaboration tools for employees; a product development scientist who had worked on pet and health products; recruiters who helped staff distribution centers; and a private-label portfolio manager who previously worked as a buyer of products aimed at LGBTQIA+ consumers. A deluge of LinkedIn posts in the days following the announcements underscored how widespread the layoffs were, and how deeply it cut to the core of a tight-knit business community. Target is one of the largest employers in the state of Minnesota, with a large network of alumni in the area. Remaining workers hyped up their now former colleagues and lamented what the layoffs would do to their workloads, while some people who were impacted during Target’s last mass round of layoffs in 2015 gave advice to this new round of job seekers. “There’s this strange mix of gratitude and heaviness that comes with staying while others go,” Camilo Zapata, a senior manager of site merchandising for beauty who is remaining with the company, wrote on LinkedIn. “For those of us still here, the road ahead will bring new challenges, bigger scopes, and the responsibility to rebuild stability for our teams.” Leaders at the company wrote about how they had lost key support figures on their teams. “You can’t downsize this hard and willy-nilly without that work being pushed on others,” one laid-off employee told Modern Retail on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation. “My sister teams are really upset I was let go, as well as [further] teams I partnered with.” Similarly, Shelbi Craig, senior market research and insights analyst for Roundel, Target’s retail media business, wrote on LinkedIn about two analysts on her team who lost their jobs. One had only been there for a few months, and the other had been in her role for more than two years. “Losing two people who directly supported my work is a huge shift,” Craig wrote. “I’m deeply grateful to still have a job and a steady income in such a challenging job market, but I also feel the weight of what this means — both for those who are facing uncertainty and for those of us feeling the ripple effects of losing close teammates.” A Target spokesperson said the company did not pursue the layoffs to cut costs and instead meant to create a more agile organization that can make faster decisions. “The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” However, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli estimated that the savings from the cuts could come in at around $90 million to $100 million, according to MarketWatch. To be sure, this was based on salaries from Glassdoor and Salary.com that said the average Target corporate salary ran around $90,000 to $100,000. Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce — who has been monitoring retail companies for decades — said moving to not fill whichever jobs are open is typically a cost-cutting measure rather than one of boosting efficiency. He believes this could be a move to simply improve the company’s financial picture after several underwhelming quarters. “You’re not going to get the most strategic force reduction if you’re just simply trying to not hire jobs that are unhired,” Gildenberg said. “I understand what Target’s trying to say, which is that we are trying to get faster and leaner and this is a way to do that, but it also is reasonably obvious that Target’s got economic pressures on it that it needs to sort out.” In an analyst note, David Bellinger, a director and senior analyst for Mizuho Securities who covers consumer and e-commerce companies, said his firm expects more restructuring activity from Target in the months following the busy holiday period. He said the move is “a difficult first of many steps as [Target] moves from its mediocre era into its turnaround era.” “Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us,” Fiddelke wrote in his message to staff, then alluding to the same three goals he outlined in August after being named the company’s next CEO. “It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can lead with merchandising authority; elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests.” Over the coming months, the layoffs will release hundreds of Target employees, largely based in Minneapolis, into the job market. Target is not the only major employer making major changes that impact the region. Paul DeBettignies, founder of Launch Hiring, said he has also spoken with Minneapolis-area workers who were just let go from Amazon and agriculture company Cargill this week. “I’m concerned about the already unemployed folks,” he said. “It just does not help having another pool of — I don’t like to use the word competition, but it’s what it is.” Ted Chalupsky, founder and CEO of The Right Staff, a staffing and recruiting company in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, said his firm is now starting to hear from Target workers who have been laid off and expects to hear from more in the coming weeks. He said that while it’s never a good time to lose a position, he thinks those who have been laid off this month are in a better boat than they would have been had they been in the market a year or two ago. “We’re seeing the job market starting to pick up again,” Chalupsky said, adding that federal interest rate cuts and increased clarity around tariffs have helped make employers more optimistic. “The word that we’re getting back, just in general, from our clientele is that we’re going to see a pickup in hiring over the next two quarters in this market.” Chalupsky said that in 2015, when Target laid off 1,700 people and left 1,400 positions unfilled, many ended up at smaller or mid-sized companies in the region instead of large corporations. He expects the same trend within this round of layoffs. “They ended up actually in better positions,” Chalupsky said. “Many comments that we heard back from these different candidates [were] basically, ‘Gee, if I’d known about this company or this opportunity, I probably would have made this move a long time ago.’” The layoffs come after Target in September began requiring workers to return to its headquarters office three days a week. For some, that means they had to move or at least adopt new routines shortly before being laid off. “As a citizen in the region, I’m kind of annoyed that they would have brought everybody back after Labor Day, and then now have done this,” DeBettignies said. He added that he expects these changes, combined with the controversy around the DEI pullback, to depress worker sentiment at the company and lead to additional departures once the job market heats up a bit more. “I wonder what [Target’s] Glassdoor is going to look like in about 60 days,” DeBettignies said. “It’s not going to be pretty.” Beyond driving immediate sales, brands this year are angling to get into gift guides to help them with SEO and GEO.

Title: US layoffs reflect ‘no hire, more fire’ environment

The US labor marketâs post-pandemic penchant for holding on to employees is coming to an end, analysts say. For years, many large businesses effectively hoarded workers, leading to a âno hire, no fireâ environment; thatâs now shifted to a âno hire, more fireâ job market, a Reuters columnist wrote. Amazon, UPS, Intel, Accenture, and Microsoft have announced layoffs recently, citing shrinking margins and the adoption of AI. Investors have welcomed the job cuts this year; one economist likened the mood to the 1990s, when âwe used to reward companies for letting people go.â The trend carries risks for the broader economy â though experts donât have the full picture without official data, which isnât being released during the US government shutdown.

Title: Something Just Broke – It Appears That A Liquidity Crisis Is Upon Us, And That Is Really Bad News For The Financial Markets

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? What is the Fed not telling us? The numbers clearly indicate that big trouble is brewing in the banking system. I wish that I could specifically tell you which banks are in the most trouble, but at this stage we simply aren’t being told anything. They probably figure that the best approach is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible. But they won’t be able to keep a lid on what is going on indefinitely, and when word finally gets out people could start to panic. In recent weeks, bank reserves have fallen to alarmingly low levels. In fact, last week they fell to the lowest level that we have seen in more than four years… US bank reserves have crashed to a four-year low, plunging to about $2.8 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve data, sending fresh warning signals across Wall Street and Washington. The steep decline marks the second straight week reserves have stayed below $3 trillion, a critical threshold analysts say could test the banking system’s liquidity strength. By itself, this doesn’t necessarily signal that we are facing a major crisis. But everyone agrees that what we are witnessing is certainly unusual. What is causing far more alarm is what occurred on Friday. All of a sudden, there was an insane amount of demand for overnight repo cash… Federal Reserve reportedly pumped about $29.4 billion into the markets via overnight repos. That’s a big number and it signals something I’m watching closely. According to the data for “Overnight Repurchase Agreements — Treasury Securities Purchased by the Fed” the figure for Oct 31, 2025 is $29.400 billion. In other words: The Fed is quietly stepping in and stepping up. To me, this is clear evidence that something just broke. Who suddenly needed that much cash? And why did they need it? The chart that I have posted below comes directly from the Federal Reserve, and it should chill you to the core… But that wasn’t the end of it. By the end of the day on Friday, it was quite obvious that something extremely strange had just happened… Federal Reserve liquidity facilities caught fire on Friday as month-end pressures pushed a key lending tool to a record level of usage. The Fed’s Standing Repo Facility lent a total of $50.35 billion on Friday to eligible financial firms in two separate availabilities, the highest-ever usage since the tool was put in place in 2021 to provide fast loans collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. At the same time, financial firms also parked a considerable amount of cash on Fed books, with the reverse repo facility seeing inflows of $51.8 billion. So what is the bottom line? The bottom line is that it very much smells like a major crisis is brewing. But let’s wait and see what happens on Monday. If we see figures on Monday that are fairly normal, perhaps we have more time before things start breaking loose in the markets. However, if we see even larger numbers on Monday, hold on tight. In either case, the financial markets will not be able to stay disconnected from the real economy forever. Just like in 2008 and 2009, large employers all over the United States have been conducting mass layoffs. Sadly, this time around that includes some of our largest and most prosperous employers… The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. We haven’t seen anything like this in many years. Bankruptcies are soaring, delinquency rates are spiking, thousands of stores and restaurants are permanently shutting their doors, and just about everything just keeps getting more expensive. What we are now facing is being described as “Depression 2.0”. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning and most of the population understands this. In fact, one recent survey discovered that 57 percent of Americans expect economic conditions to get even worse over the next year. Many of you are going to be facing some very hard decisions in the coming months. If you currently have a job that you highly value, I would recommend holding on to it as tightly as you can. But if you feel that it is absolutely necessary to go somewhere else, you will just have to do what you have to do. Just understand that if you leave your current position it will not be easy to find a new one at all. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Americans lost their jobs. Many of them didn’t have anything to fall back on, and so large numbers of them also lost their homes. This is one of the reasons why it is so critical to have a sizable emergency fund. At this point, even the mainstream media is stressing the importance of this… Most people live paycheck to paycheck, and when the economy crashes, that leaves no room to breathe. Having three to six months of essential expenses tucked away can make all the difference when cash flow dries up or jobs disappear overnight. Keep your emergency savings in an easily accessible account, not tied up in volatile investments. It’s not about hoarding—it’s about buying time and peace of mind. When others panic, you’ll have the stability to make smart, calm decisions. I expect things to start moving very quickly now. If the problems in our banking system bubble to the surface and start becoming highly visible, it will create a lot of fear. And it is just a matter of time before our absurdly overvalued stock market takes a dramatic tumble. Of course all of this is happening at a time when so many other elements of “the Perfect Storm” are coming together. We are right on the brink of multiple major wars, global food supplies are rapidly getting tighter, we are being told that the next worldwide pandemic could break out at any moment, and on average the U.S. has been getting hit by a “billion dollar disaster” about every two weeks. I expect so much chaos to be unleashed during the weeks ahead, and that means that we should expect the turmoil that we are currently witnessing on Wall Street to escalate quite a bit more.

Title: Why Millions Of Women Are Choosing Entrepreneurship In 2025

ByCaroline Castrillon, Senior Contributor. In 2024, women started nearly 1 of every 2 new businesses in America. That’s the highest rate on record, according to Gusto’s 2025 New Business Formation study. In addition, between 2019 and 2023, the number of women-owned businesses increased at nearly double the rate of their male counterparts, the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Business Report reveals. Women are leaving traditional corporate roles in unprecedented numbers to pursue entrepreneurship, writing their own rules for what success looks like. One example is April Springer, a former HR professional turned multi-unit business owner with Next Day Access, a provider of mobility and accessibility products. Based in Minneapolis, she owns three locations and also serves as vice president for the Minnesota and Pittsburgh territories. Her first location generated more than $1 million in revenue in its first year. She’s since expanded into multiple markets and now mentors other women in franchising. Her journey offers insights into the most powerful reasons millions of women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate careers. The traditional corporate ladder no longer represents the pinnacle of achievement for many women. Success has become deeply personal, shaped by individual values rather than external expectations. As Springer explains, "I think women are redefining success on their own terms. There's no one-size-fits-all version of what a successful career or life looks like." This shift stems from: Expert Tip: Before making any major career move, write down your personal definition of success in specific, measurable terms. If you find yourself describing someone else's achievements or using vague terms, you haven't defined it yet. Your definition should be so clear you'd know instantly whether you're living it. Traditional employment models weren't built for modern life. More women are seeking careers that can adapt to their evolving priorities, whether that's family responsibilities, personal passions or the desire for autonomy over their schedules. As Springer explains, "The traditional corporate path doesn't always offer the flexibility, fulfillment or creativity many women are seeking. Entrepreneurship allows women to design a life and career that align with their values and priorities." What flexibility really means: Expert Tip: Track your energy and productivity patterns for two weeks. If your current job structure conflicts with your natural rhythms and priorities more than 60% of the time, that's a signal that entrepreneurship might serve you better. The rise of social media has transformed how women view entrepreneurship. Platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok showcase real stories of women building successful businesses, making the path to entrepreneurship feel more accessible than ever before. Springer notes the impact of this visibility, "Social media has also played a big role in this shift. When women see others building successful businesses and balancing life in ways that inspire them, it creates momentum." The digital community effect includes: Expert Tip: Follow 10-15 women entrepreneurs in your industry on social media. Don't just scroll—actively engage. Comment on their posts, ask questions and join conversations. The connections you build digitally often translate into real mentorship and support when you launch your own venture. For women who want to be their own boss but feel intimidated by starting from scratch, franchising presents a compelling middle ground. Franchise models provide proven systems, established branding and built-in support networks that significantly reduce the risk associated with new business ventures. The franchise advantage includes: Expert Tip: Before investing in any franchise, speak with at least five current franchisees you choose yourself—not the ones referred by the franchisor. Ask specifically about hidden costs, actual time commitments and whether they'd make the same choice again. Many women entrepreneurs aren’t just chasing profits. They’re building small businesses with purpose. The desire to create meaningful impact drives many women to leave stable corporate positions for the uncertainty of entrepreneurship. Mission-driven businesses benefit from: Expert Tip: Define your business mission in one sentence: "We help [specific people] achieve [specific outcome] so they can [meaningful benefit]." If you struggle to complete this sentence clearly, spend more time refining your purpose. A vague mission won't sustain you through entrepreneurship's challenges. Amazon recently announced 14,000 corporate job cuts, while Target eliminated 1,000 roles. Entire departments can disappear overnight due to restructuring, automation or economic shifts. For many women, entrepreneurship offers more control over their financial future than any corporate job ever could. When you own your business, your income depends on your own efforts, not on someone else's decision to cut headcount. Why women are choosing entrepreneurship over corporate jobs: Expert Tip: If you're concerned about leaving your corporate job, start your business as a side hustle while still employed. Test your concept, build a client base and validate your income potential before making the leap. Many successful entrepreneurs launch this way, reducing risk while proving their business model works. The millions of women pursuing entrepreneurship today aren't abandoning ambition. They're redefining it on their own terms. It proves the best career path isn’t always the one laid out by someone else. Often, it’s the one you build yourself.
