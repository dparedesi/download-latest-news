Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The e-commerce giant said the deal, for an undisclosed amount, has yet to close. Amazon has confirmed that it is acquiring AI wearables company Bee. The news was first revealed via Bee’s website and a social media post from Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, is signed but hasn’t closed, an Amazon spokesperson said by email. The company sells a wristband that records, transcribes and provides feedback on conversations for about $50; a subscription service is also planned. Those plans are likely to gain steam under Amazon’s ownership. Subscriptions as sources of recurring revenue have long been a focus of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy; in its most recent quarter, the company’s subscription revenue rose 9% to $11.7 billion. In May, Jassy touted Alexa+, the agentic AI upgrade of the company’s Alexa virtual assistant, and told analysts that the company is investing in AI to further customer service innovations. All Bee employees received offers to join Amazon, though the company spokesperson declined to provide numbers. Last month, Jassy warned employees that AI was likely to lead to workforce cuts. This year Amazon announced layoffs in its North America retail and bookselling businesses.

Title: Vibe Coding Turned This Swedish AI Unicorn Into The Fastest Growing Software Startup Ever

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin, Forbes Staff. Oskar Munck af Rosenschöld never planned to be in show business. But over a fika (coffee break) in Stockholm, Sweden, a film producer friend pitched him on a startup idea: a marketplace to match films with financiers, helping European moviemakers with the neverending task of raising money. Often such ideas never escape the talking stage. But just a few months later, FrameSage was live and had booked its first $50,000 in revenue—thanks to a new AI coding tool, Lovable, that Munck af Rosenschöld used to build the company’s plumbing in just 10 days. “You feel like you have the magic key to build software,” says Munck af Rosenschöld, whose works as a project mana­ger at a pharma company by day and who had never coded before outside of school. “This has saved us tens of thousands of dollars on developers and around four months’ work.” Munck af Rosenschöld isn’t the only young founder to have fallen for Lovable, Sweden’s new AI unicorn. In June alone, around 750,000 projects—apps, websites, entire businesses—were built, hosted and launched with a handful of descriptive sentences and a few clicks on Lovable. This isn’t like the clunky website builders of yesteryear, responsible for zillions of personal sites; nor are they sketches or wireframes that might look cool but aren’t functional. Lovable projects, spun up in minutes thanks to generative AI, are actual working products with features ranging from email newsletters to payments via Stripe. “I was shown Lovable and knew what I was going to do for the coming years,” says Malmö, Sweden–based Jaleel Miles, who built his restaurant management startup, Quicktables, in just two months on Lovable. He has booked over $120,000 in sales from the site since May. Lovable has become the fastest-growing software startup in history, reaching $100 million in subscription revenue (on an annualized basis) in just eight months since its launch last November, eclipsing other rocketships like Israeli cloud security startup Wiz and San Francisco–based HR platform Deel (which hit the same benchmark in 18 months and just under two years, respectively). “Humans are builders at heart, but being able to write code, or having access to capital, has been the defining part of being able to build software,” says cofounder and CEO Anton Osika, 34, who started Lovable in September 2023. “Now we are entering a new era.” It’s not just scrappy young founders who are building on Lovable. Rio de Janeiro–based QConcursos has about 200 staff helping Brazilian students prepare for college and civil service exams. CEO Caio Moretti says he used Lovable to spin up a new premium version of its app in just two weeks. It made over $3 million in its first 48 hours. “If we were coding on our legacy platform it would have taken us a year to build a new product,” he says. Photo by Sebastian Nevols for Forbes It was a pickleball tournament tracking app that did it for Accel partner Ben Fletcher. The London-based investor built the gadget on Lovable in a weekend, then spun up a tool that helps Accel sift through startup sales data. He’s now leading a $200 million round in the Swedish startup, which values the 45-person company at $1.8 billion (its cofounders’ estimated 50% stake is jointly worth $900 million). “We see Lovable as an opinionated CTO that builds your product for you,” says Osika, who has just started writing his own small checks into Lovable’s most promising projects. That $200 million, on top of the $23 million it raised previously, should help Lovable fend off competition from well-funded Bay Area rivals like Replit (which last raised $97 million at a $1.2 billion valuation) and StackBlitz—which raised $105 million in January and is on this year’s Next Billion-Dollar Startups list. But it’s not just other upstarts Lovable needs to worry about. AI giants OpenAI and Google, whose Firebase Studio can build apps and websites from prompts in simple English, are also interested in the so-called “vibe coding” market. The same tech that’s powering Lovable and its rivals is also sweeping through Silicon Valley’s professional ranks. Startups like Cursor, Cline and Cognition’s code writing tools for pro programmers are transforming how tech is built. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella claims that as much as 30% of the company’s code is now written by AI. Google’s Sundar Pichai, who has made similar claims, reportedly just spent $2.4 billion to poach the founders of Windsurf to pump up Google’s AI code tools. Once-coveted software engineers were reportedly caught up in recent layoffs at both companies. Venture fund SignalFire, which tracks tech recruitment, saw hires for entry-level coders drop by a quarter last year. But Lovable doesn’t pretend to cater to the pros. Its fans are tinkerers, designers and entrepreneurs. “Developers are really important, but they’re only 1% of the market,” Fletcher says. For entrepreneurs like Theresa Anoje, who had never coded anything beyond tweaks to her Tumblr page, Lovable has been a game changer. For years, the San Francisco–based founder wanted to build her careers newsletter, Remotely Good, into a full-fledged job-hunting website but had hit a wall with fundraising and scaling up. Then she built a new website in just a weekend with Lovable. “It was an enormous relief,” she says. “It was a revelation.” Lovable lets anyone make a handful of simple projects for free, but more-complex features and AI code requests can be unlocked with fees star-ting at $25 per month. Building something like the classic cellphone game Snake would cost the equivalent of a buck in Lovable credits, while a more-elaborate app could run upward of $50. That’s still less than the hourly rate of even humdrum human programmers. Osika himself didn’t start out as a coder, even though he’s been programming since age 12 the same type of simple games that Lovable can now build in minutes. He studied physics at Sweden’s elite KTH Royal Institute of Technology and then joined CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, in Switzerland. He lasted only a few months; CERN had a thousands-strong army of the best physicists in the world, but Osika quickly started to think the slow grind on “impossible projects” like hunting dark matter was a waste of human potential. “The realization was that you have much, much more impact being in industry, building companies,” he says. After a stint at Stockholm-based proprietary trading firm Ampfield, Osika joined an education AI startup in 2017, then signed on as cofounder and CTO at Depict AI, helping cofounder Oliver Edholm sell an Amazon-style product recommendation algorithm to retailers. They joined startup hothouse Y Combinator and within a year generated $1 million of revenue, raising $17 million in 2022 from big-name investors like Tiger Global. But Depict’s growth fizzled along with pandemic e-commerce mania, and AI began to catch fire with the launch of ChatGPT. “I was thinking, ‘We have to do this at Depict, or I have to find a way to leverage this huge wave that is coming toward us,’ ” Osika says. He was so sure of the potential that he built an AI tool dubbed GPT Engineer in his spare time, publishing it to developer platform Github in June 2023. When the app shot to the top of Github’s trending page almost overnight, Osika knew he was on to something. So he quit, recruiting former Depict staffer Fabian Hedin to be his cofounder and CTO. The duo decided to turn his code-heavy GPT Engineer into a visual tool that anyone could use. “There was this realization that this was extremely powerful,” Hedin says. They raised an $8 million seed round led by venture fund Hummingbird in October 2023. When the first version of Lovable flopped, they rewired it to handle more than simple games or static websites. Lovable raked in more than $5 million in just over a month after the team relaunched in November 2024. Lovable is now booking around $1 million a day in subscriptions, but competition is fierce. Its focus on portfolio sites and simple prototypes puts it on a collision course with an earlier generation of unicorns like Figma and website builders such as Wix and Squarespace. All these companies are also building their own AI tools. Figma launched a code generator earlier this year, and in June, Nasdaq-listed Wix spent $80 million to buy a six-month-old AI coding startup. Lovable has limitations. It aces web design, but the plumbing of more complex apps still needs a human touch. For Dutch AI engineer Lennert Jansen, a Lovable-built prototype was enough to land a spot at Y Combinator for his startup Airweave, which helps connect apps like Gmail with autonomous bits of code called AI agents. Lovable struggled with the technical back end, so Jansen and his cofounder hand-coded it and have since rewritten the remaining Lovable code. Still, accelerating the early work meant serious time savings. “If we hadn’t had Lovable, it wouldn’t have given us this tangible starting point,” Jansen says. “It was a massive win with the speed this market moves.” Now Airweave is making $17,000 a month and just landed $6 million in funding. Another vulnerability: Like many in its cohort of vibe-coding startups, Lovable relies on the same set of underlying AI models, notably Anthropic’s Claude. Lovable is spending millions of dollars a month on these models to power its coding. Some other startups are even heavier spenders, which has put Anthropic on track to make a reported $4 billion in revenue this year. Now Anthropic, last valued at $60 billion, is selling its own code tool directly. Osika can’t do much about this competition other than to stick to building products that humans love and hop between AI models for the best and cheapest. “Humans understand humans,” he says, “and Lovable is this enabling tool to make ideas come to life in minutes.” Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images DB Apple/picture alliance/DPA/Newscom

Title: A laid-off Microsoft manager says it's not a personal failure, but he may pivot away from management
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-manager-laid-off-great-flattening-next-career-move-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-23T08:32:01Z

Patrice Melekian wanted to experience life in the US, and his job at Microsoft was his ticket. He told Business Insider he had a good, 17-year run with the company — until he got laid off from his manager job in May. He's returned to his home country of France, and while he's still figuring out his next career move, he said he might look outside management for his next role. Like many laid-off workers, Melekian doesn't know exactly why his job was cut. But he said Microsoft leaders have spoken about reducing management layers and improving efficiency — language that has coincided with manager layoffs over the past year. Melekian believes these efforts are part of a broader trend in tech. "Many companies in the tech industry, including Microsoft, have been moving to flatten their organizations to streamline the decision process," said the 54-year-old. In May, Microsoft laid off roughly 6,000 employees in an effort to increase what it calls "span of control" — or the number of employees who report to each manager, Business Insider previously reported. Then, earlier this month, the company laid off roughly 9,000 more workers. A spokesperson told BI earlier this month that the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. It's not just Microsoft. Companies like Google, Intel, Amazon, and Walmart have announced plans to reduce the number of managers. This trend, which some have dubbed the "Great Flattening," refGreat Flatteningpush to reduce costs and bureaucracy — moves some corporate executives say will make their organizations more efficient. Microsoft did not respond to BI's request for comment. We want to hear from middle managers, job seekers, and people who recently landed a job. If you're open to sharing your story, please fill out one or more of the linked Google Forms. Melekian joined Microsoft in 2007 through an acquisition, taking on a role as a program manager architect. He grew up in France and was living in Paris at the time, but became interested in moving to the US — partly out of curiosity about what it would be like to live there. In 2013, he relocated with his wife and two sons from Paris to Redmond, Washington — home to Microsoft's headquarters — to take a senior program manager role. At the time of his layoff, he was a principal product manager, leading a team of three. While Microsoft's effort to reduce management layers could leave some managers with more direct reports, Melekian said the number of people reporting to him hovered between two and three, depending on business needs — a structure he thinks worked well for his team. He said his role, which required balancing management responsibilities with hands-on project work, didn't change much during his three years as a principal product manager. Having a modest team size gave him the flexibility to spend more time on projects — something he appreciated. "When you have a team of three, you don't have to spend that much time managing," he said. "If a new opportunity came up and everybody was packed, that allowed me to jump in, take some of my own time, and go after it myself." Melekian said he started his principal product manager role during the pandemic, when remote work was widespread at the company. When Microsoft's offices reopened, he had the option to continue working from home and chose to do so. Microsoft's policy currently allows most employees to work remotely at least part of the time, though a decline in productivity could prompt a shift in policy, BI previously reported. Though a layoff is rarely happy news, Melekian said the timing was relatively fortunate: He had already been planning to move back to France for personal and family reasons. With his parents getting older, he wanted to be closer in case they needed support. His youngest son also just graduated from high school and plans to attend school in France this fall. "With our children and our own aging parents all being in France, there was nothing holding my wife and me back in the US," he said. Melekian said he's already sold his home in the US and returned to France, but hasn't started actively job hunting yet. He plans to do so later this summer once he's more settled. When his job search picks up, he's not sure whether he'll prioritize management roles or individual contributor positions. He said he may prefer a role with less managerial responsibility — one where he can have a more direct impact. "Manager roles certainly align with my experience, but I may also consider roles where I can contribute directly with my expertise," he said. Melekian said he has a few pieces of advice for people who are dealing with layoffs or career transitions. First, rely on others for advice and support. "You'd be surprised how willing people are to share their own similar experiences and help you navigate transitions," he said. Additionally, he recommended people keep an open mind to different job opportunities — and not rush their next career decision. "A layoff can feel like a personal failure, but it's usually the result of a broader business shift rather than an indication of your worth as a professional," he said. "Use the pause as an opportunity to reassess what's genuinely important for you personally and professionally." Jump to

Title: What CFOs Need To Know (And Often Don’t) About Company Workers

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. There aren’t many good things to have come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, but a new study of finance professionals from accounts payable software maker AvidXchange pinpoints one of them: Businesses increased their readiness for the unexpected. As businesses navigate an uncertain financial future, two-thirds say they are more prepared to handle it now than five years ago, when many normal flows of global commerce were disrupted by the virus. Since the pandemic, companies have been investing more in strategic financial technology, including for automation, operational effectiveness, forecasting and productivity. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said technology implemented during the pandemic is helping them now, with seven in 10 reporting that technology is at least very important to their ability to continue to respond to market changes. Just having the technology available doesn’t mean that finance professionals are confident in what is coming next, however. The vast majority—86%—are concerned about the state of the economy, and half have deeper concerns about a potential recession. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable financial policy, punctuated by threats of high tariffs that are often delayed and revised, has made planning difficult. Nearly half of all companies are reevaluating their budgets and discretionary spending. Three in 10 are using scenario planning and financial modeling to prepare for a range of outcomes. So far, just over half have made moderate changes to their forecasts because of impending tariffs, but about a quarter that have been minimally impacted so far are monitoring them closely. Close to a fifth—17%—said the tariff threat has significantly disrupted planning and required major adjustments. This survey was taken in late spring—April to May—and many of the proposed tariffs seemed to loom much more in the immediate future. That effective date has shifted through the months, and is now set for August 1. However, one thing that hasn’t changed since this survey was conducted is the unknown nature of the immediate financial picture, which has been a consistent fog over finance departments since January. When companies are being prudent about their finances, one area where they often make cuts is personnel. However, many companies fail to share relevant people data between managers, HR and the finance department, leading companies to cut employees based on salaries alone—a strategy that sometimes will lead to vital knowledge and capabilities being cut, and ultimately losing more money in the long run. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about why companies need to share data to make better informed staffing cuts in difficult times. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday. Stocks climbed to fresh all-time highs on Monday. What uncertain economy? Looking at the stock market, the U.S. economy appears to be making fast progress with nothing in its way. The S&P 500 shattered records with two all-time highs in the last week—Monday and Thursday—while the Nasdaq also set a daily record on Monday. Optimism in technology, especially AI, is buoying the markets, with Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Verizon, Qualcomm and Broadcom leading Monday’s rally. Analysts are mixed on whether the rally will continue, with strategists at Goldman Sachs, Wells and Fargo projecting more growth this year. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase and Evercore ISI are projecting a decrease. Positive economic data has helped boost the markets. Unemployment claims hit 221,000 last week, down 7,000 from the week before, and June’s retail sales were up 0.6% over May, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Additionally, 83% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings so far this quarter exceeded expectations. Alphabet and Tesla, two of the “Magnificent Seven” tech companies, will report their earnings later this week. Despite all of these positive numbers, however, tariffs are still waiting in the wings, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman. According to President Donald Trump’s latest deadlines, many of them will start on August 1, and could begin to impact the prices companies and consumers pay soon thereafter. Countries and companies are working to figure out how to mitigate the majority of the impact when it comes, the Washington Post reports. Meanwhile, Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that a distressing sign is emerging from consumers: 5.1% of all car loans are delinquent, marking a 15-year high in subprime loan delinquencies. Osman writes car loans tend to be the last payment Americans skip. When times are tight, they may miss a credit card, utility, mortgage or rent payment, but vehicles tend to be the last thing they will risk losing. Osman writes that credit stress is spreading as household debt increases, while credit card and buy-now, pay-later companies tighten their standards. President Donald Trump holds up the just-signed GENIUS Act with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) applauding next to him. The U.S. has regulations in place to govern some types of cryptocurrency. Last week, President Trump signed legislation to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of assets like the U.S. dollar. The new laws put guidelines in place for banks and other entities to issue stablecoins. The new law has been hailed as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Analysts told him that with regulations in place, there will be more momentum to establish and invest in cryptocurrency, both for individual investors and corporate entities. And several companies are looking into the issue. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Walmart and Amazon are considering launching their own stablecoins as a way to circumvent traditional payment systems. With the ink barely dry on the new law, the earliest impacts have come in the form of runaway valuations on Bitcoin and Ethereum stablecoins. Prices for these tokens have skyrocketed over the last week. Two other Republican-backed bills that would provide more regulation on the industry are currently before the Senate. They would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency and divide regulatory jurisdiction for digital assets between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill—dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act—the 50% tax deduction on food and drinks in the office expires on January 1, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. Office coffee, snacks and employee meals got a 50% tax break under Trump’s signature 2017 financial policy bill, but the perk did not get renewed in the latest policy bill. (Unless you work on a fishing vessel in Alaska or a restaurant, that is.) The end of the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade, Erb writes—a relatively small increase in revenue, considering the bill includes tax cuts adding up to $4.475 trillion in the next decade. The question now facing companies is whether to continue stocking the office kitchen with goodies. A 2023 survey found that eight in 10 employees said catered meals encouraged them to come into the office, and 98% said free meals at work make them feel appreciated. But considering the other internal cost issues that may be at play in 2026, it may be challenging for companies to preserve a non-deductible employee perk. Andrea Derler, Visier Principal, Research and Customer Value. When it’s time to cut costs, financial leaders typically begin by looking at a company’s largest cost center: personnel. But the CFO’s office and the personnel department don’t always have the same data—down to agreeing on total employee counts—and the information the CFO has is usually based on numbers and location, missing important context like job functions and company plans for further growth. I spoke with Andrea Derler, principal in Research and Customer Value at AI workforce analytics platform Visier, about how everyone in the company can align on its workforce. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. In an ideal business situation, what kind of access would the CFO have of personnel data? Derler: To begin with, what type of data does the organization have? How is it currently processed and integrated? I’m exaggerating here, but she’s probably not going to be interested in seeing a spreadsheet with 300,000 employees. Ideally, it’s in a system where it’s easily accessible to the C-suite. The better it is integrated and actually prepared for results and insights, the easier it becomes. These people don’t have time to play around with the system for half an hour to get to one insight. What’s our headcount? Where’s the diversity in terms of women in leadership positions? How does our projected headcount actually affect our ability to meet our targets next quarter? That needs to be really easily integrated. In terms of the detail and what they see, hopefully they’ll work with the relevant IT and CHRO teams to understand: Can I have access to this and that because I need it for this and that? The collaborative aspect of all of these decisions is increasingly high nowadays because it’s technically possible: Understanding and negotiating access to certain data points and certain business units is really a collaborative effort. There’s a basic set of metrics that are always relevant. We need to know who is going, who is coming in the organization, particularly for workforce planning. You always need to know who is where. Engagement may not be the most important one for the CFO because it’s further away from proof to say it really affects the bottom line. Closer to that would be how many people do we have? Do we have the right skills, and how is it going to affect our projected revenue next year? What are some of the bigger things that go wrong in companies because the CFO doesn’t necessarily have access to good data from HR? We have a massive data set of [about] more 30 million employee records of global industry data. We look at that data constantly. Two years ago, we studied layoffs—reduction in force, turnover, resignation. Most companies have some type of a number we can see in our data. Then I interviewed six CHROs to understand what the decision making process around layoff positions look like? If there’s a very short term calculation: I’m going to save this much if I let 10% go in the next three months, what’s sometimes missing? Sure, you have the cost savings in the short term, but what’s sometimes neglected is what the actual long-term cost is. I’m going to let go 10% now because I think we don’t need them anymore, and currently I‘m going to have to save some costs. Sometimes, what’s not happening is thinking ahead 12 months. We want to grow again after the difficult economic times. Now, I’m going to have to rehire individuals or find new replacement employees. We know that hiring new employees is generally much more expensive than keeping existing employees and helping them either internally to find different roles or reskill them. There’s a lot of academic research and also industry research that found that layoffs most of the time are not really financially making sense because the planning capabilities don’t always exist. If the CFO knew how much it’s going to cost their company to rehire, knowing it may cost a lot more, giving us another headache in two years time, [they may advise against it]. They had only the financial data and said, ‘Oh man, we are spending way too much on wages. We’re going to have to make some cost savings.’ That’s for lack of data integration. That’s for lack of the ability to collaborate and look at the same data set and do thorough scenario planning, very much to the detriment, not only of the employees who are being let go, but even financially, it doesn’t make sense most of the time. What advice would you give to a CFO who wants to make the best financial decisions in the long run for their company when it comes to personnel, and feels like they need to have more access to information? The first thing, very practically, I would recommend that they would go to their counterparts— CHRO or IT—and find out how solidly set up they are from a technology and analytics perspective in terms of what do we have? How are we set up? Are we still working on spreadsheets? What questions can you answer for me here and now—not tomorrow, next week, not in two months, because we still have to do all the calculations manually. That would be an expectation that the CFO can reasonably have, to say, ‘Well, if we want to make good decisions, that’s what we need.’ Secondly, gauge the appetite. If it’s not in place, make a business case for it and say, ‘I will be able to make more solid financial decisions if I have the solid HR data behind me. I can make a decision faster and be more agile. That’s a big selling point. Currently, with all that’s happening in the economy, it’s very hard to plan ahead. You need agility and the ability to look something up today. Find out what’s in place. If nothing’s in place, what’s the appetite, and who are the stakeholders that I need to engage with within the company? The third important task that they could do by themselves is list what’s missing for me right now in terms of people data. These are the table stakes five questions that I need to be able to answer so I can, as a CFO, make meaningful decisions, or help at least advise the board or others on those decisions. Businesses do want to make money, but your success and longevity may depend on your ability to do something else: create value for your customers. Here are some ways to make a shift away from pure profit, but possibly a better market position. If you want to add some leadership insight to your summer reading list, here are six books to help you reflect on your shortcomings and learn how to lead your team more effectively.

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Amazon Prime Day saw mixed results: initial sales reports were disputed, final growth was estimated to be modest (4.9%), and web traffic declined. However, consumers showed strong purchase intent, actively seeking deals across retailers due to inflation. Analysts project 2.5-3% Q4 retail growth, highlighting consumer resilience despite economic uncertainties and potential supply chain challenges. Happy family and their daughter shopping online for Christmas Controversy erupted early on July 8, the first of Amazon Prime Day’s four-day sales extravaganza. Momentum Commerce, which manages $7 billion in sales annually on Amazon, reported first day sales were down 41% compared to last year. An Amazon spokesperson fired back, telling Forbes that the report was “highly inaccurate” and that Momentum Commerce, a third-party consultancy firm, didn’t have access to the full dataset. However, the damage was done, thanks to the anchoring bias where the news broke, it was already stained in people’s memory. Amazon’s post-Prime Day wrap-up didn’t help, since it provided no sales figures or any hint at growth. It claimed record-breaking sales, but it didn’t factor in the fact that the event went from two to four days. With two more days, Amazon was bound to break records. Questions remained even after Adobe Analytics reported that aggregated four-day e-commerce sales exceeded projections, totaling $24.1 billion in online retail sales on a 30.3% year-over-year increase. Increasingly, analysts look to Prime Day results to help forecast holiday retail performance. The apples-to-oranges comparison complicates an already complicated picture. Digging into a variety of sources provides a clearer picture of how Amazon performed over Prime Day and where the retail market is headed into the holiday season. Let’s start here: Consumers didn’t wait until July Prime Day to pick up their shopping pace. For June, retailers posted a 0.6% seasonally adjusted uptick in spending from May and a 3.7% unadjusted increase year-over-year. While Momentum’s first day report was discredited, it released a final estimate that Amazon Prime Day sales over the four days generated 4.9% total sales growth compared to the combined performance of 2024's two-day Prime Day and the two days immediately following. That fell well under Momentum’s prediction of 9.1% growth for Amazon over the four-day event. Momentum also expected that demand would be softer during the first two days and would build on days three and four. Similarweb, which tracks online traffic, found in an apples-to-apples comparison that Amazon web traffic was down. Average daily visits to Amazon.com dropped 15% comparing last year’s two-day event (July 16 and 17) to this year’s four-days (July 8 to 11). FOMO (fear of missing out) played in Amazon’s favor in 2024. And app usage followed a similar downward trajectory. Last year’s two-day event averaged 113.9 million visitors per day compared to an average of 104.1 million per day over the four-days, a 9% drop. Nonetheless, Amazon still attracted over 400 million visitors to this year’s Prime Day. However, when shoppers showed up to Amazon Prime Day, they came loaded for bear, according to a post-Prime Day survey conducted among 400 consumers by Coresight Research. Some 48% of consumers reported making a purchase, compared with 38% last year and bettering the 34% who planned to make a purchase, based on a May pre-event survey. There also was a significant increase in the share of 2025 Amazon Prime Day shoppers who reported spending more (43%) compared to 31% last year. Coresight’s consumer research also revealed shoppers widely engaged with competing sales events hosted by Walmart and Target. Over one-third of consumers reported they compared offerings across multiple retailers. They also mixed planned with spontaneous impulse buys and were motivated by early access offers and staggered promotional deals. Commenting on the survey results, Coresight’s John Mercer, who manages the firm’s global research, noted that there was a significant amount of opportunistic shopping behavior this year tied to Prime Day, as consumers sought to maximize value across competing sales events. “When consumers are cautious about inflation or the macro-environment, as we’ve seen in previous holiday seasons, they tend to pull forward some spending to spread out costs,” he said. “We think that is the case this year with consumers having concerns about inflation-driven price rises late in the season.” We’ll have to wait until Amazon reports on July 31 to get a better accounting. It’s up against a comparative 9% increase to $90 billion in North America net sales in the second quarter last year, excluding AWS. In the first quarter, North America sales advanced 8% to $92.9 billion. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, Mercer and the Coresight team see positive momentum, despite widespread consumer concern about tariffs increasing prices as the year advances. Coresight provided three possible scenarios for fourth-quarter retail performance. The most likely is retail growth in the 2.5% to 3% range, what it calls the central scenario. Interestingly, Coresight’s machine-learning model forecasts a 3.5% year-over-year increase, the upside scenario. However, the analyst team considers the more moderate growth forecast to be more “reasonable,” with a 45% overall probability versus a 30% probability for the upside scenario. Coresight also figures there is a 25% probability that retail sales will decline by 2.5% or more in the fourth quarter, should the economy take a turn for the worse with increased layoffs and rising prices causing consumer sentiment to deteriorate. “This would accelerate deal-seeking consumer behaviors and could ultimately contribute to stagflation (slow economic growth and persistently high inflation) or a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth),” Coresight warned. Another confounding factor that might mitigate retail growth in the fourth quarter is what Mercer described as the “lumpy” supply chain. Retailers picked up imports before April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, followed by a slump and another surge after the worse of the tariffs were postponed to August 1. “It makes it hard to match demand with supply,” he said. “So if we get to the holiday season and there is relatively solid consumer demand, the supply may not be there to match it. We could see a replay of holiday 2021, when consumers saw bare shelves and struggled to get some products. “Markdowns were far fewer then and more was sold at full price. So counterintuitively, we could end up seeing less discounting this holiday if the lumpy supply chain doesn’t match up to consumer demand,” he said. Despite the doomsday headlines surrounding tariff uncertainty, retail sales have climbed 3.6% through the first half of 2025 to total $4.2 trillion. While inflation inched up in June to 2.7% from 2.4% in May, it’s still below the first-half 2024 average of 3.3%. By contrast, inflation has averaged 2.6% from January to June 2025. Notably, January to June 2024 retail sales rose 2.6% over 2023 – lagging behind inflation. That’s not the case in 2025, where retail growth has outpaced rising prices, underscoring consumer momentum and resilience. “Consumers continue to spend in the face of uncertainty and shrugging off tariff concerns, with U.S. retail sales showing relative stability compared to last month and outpacing inflation compared to a year ago,” said Katie Thomas, Kearney Consumer Institute. While many observers expect retail sales to slow as the year progresses after the full force of tariffs hit, American consumer resilience could defy expectations and keep retail going strong, making Coresight’s upside 3.5% fourth-quarter growth scenario a distinct possibility.

Title: Microsoft abruptly stops selling and renting movies and TV shows on Xbox and Windows devices

But existing customers will still be able to access their purchased content As of July 18, Microsoft has stopped selling and renting TV shows and movies on both Xbox and Windows devices. An update to both the Xbox and Windows websites confirms "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content." Microsoft did not provide a reason for the withdrawal of service, but did assure customers that existing paid content will remain available for the foreseeable future. "Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ added, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality." In a FAQ that asks what other options players may have going forward, Microsoft suggests they make use of third-party entertainment apps like Amazon Prime and Apple TV. Xbox commenced its entertainment offerings in 2006, offering an initial lineup of TV shows and movies to gamers in the U.S. via Xbox Live on the one-year anniversary of its Xbox 360 console. It was the first gaming console to offer standard and high-definition TV shows and movies via digital distribution and formed part of Xbox's then lofty aspiration to be a comprehensive unified online entertainment network on its systems. Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division earlier this month, just days after multiple rumors and reports started to swirl. Over 9,000 employees are thought to have been affected.

Title: Trump sharpens the axe for the Education Department. Swing away, Mr. President. | Opinion
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/07/21/trump-education-department-layoffs/85257106007/

Full Content:
The largest employer in the United States isn't a Fortune 100 company like Alphabet, Amazon or Apple. It's the federal government − and that's a problem. Thankfully, President Donald Trump continues to slash bureaucratic bloat. On July 11, the administration sent layoff notices to more than 1,300 State Department workers, and three days later, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with plans to gut the Department of Education. That's bad news for government employees, but great for taxpayers, especially given the Education Department's expense − $268 billion in the last fiscal year − and its lack of effectiveness. Despite the department's massive budget, students in the U.S. far too often lag behind peers in other industrialized countries. In 2022, for example, American 15-year-olds scored behind peers from 25 other countries on an international math test. And we're losing ground. Math and reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress continue to decline. Part of the drop can be attributed to pandemic-related learning loss, but reading scores in the U.S. began to decline in 2019 − before Americans had even heard of COVID-19. But how will pulling the federal government out of K-12 education help? It's important to note that more than 90% of public school funding comes from state and local governments along with foundations and other private sources. Much of the federal education budget is used to feed the bureaucracy, which generates rules and regulations that local administrators and teachers must obey. If all of that bureaucratic oversight consistently produced better results, there might be a case for keeping it. But the data clearly shows it doesn't. Removing federal bureaucrats from our schools should give states and local school districts more flexibility to set education policy, and that should improve choices for parents like me. Returning more control to the states also should improve efficiency and enable schools to better meet students' needs. Trump isn't cutting jobs only at the Education Department, of course. The State Department layoffs follow reductions at other federal agencies this spring. The cuts are driven by necessity: Our national debt is now more than $37 trillion, and the annual budget deficit will top $1 trillion again in 2025. So, I was surprised to see news reports paint the laid off State Department workers as heroic. Cameras caught teary goodbyes and applause for well-liked employees. I don't recall the same concern when President Joe Biden halted construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which cost 1,500 workers their jobs and eliminated plans to create thousands more. While job loss is certainly scary, and I don't wish it on anyone, federal job cuts should be put in the context of the overall jobs market. Microsoft has announced that it would eliminate 9,000 jobs, not because the company is failing but because it's retooling as the market changes. Other companies, including Intel and Meta, have announced plans to restructure this year as the emergence of artificial intelligence and other technology changes how Americans work. The federal government should be as flexible as our top companies in adapting to a changing world. Yet, progressives have criticized the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy as cruel. The president's job, however, isn't to employ as many bureaucrats as possible. It's to deliver effective services as efficiently as possible to taxpayers. Dismantling ineffective and inefficient bureaucracies like the Education Department is a long overdue step toward achieving that goal.

July 20, 2025 11:49 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

At a minimum you would be talking about a team of chefs, groundskeepers, maintenance staff, serving staff, cleaners, etc. So I am thinking maybe a few dozen all told with some living on site. At least the interior is done in warm colours where some mansions featured on NC have interiors that can be at best described as tacky, cold and jolting to the eye. 1) It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live. 2) If I can pay $250M for such a mansion, why would on earth would I bother with a “non-functional helicopter” blocking the helipad, instead of a working one? 3) It is supposedly full of art — I could not find anything looking like it (but what do I know about the recent trends and tastes of the high gentry). The huge camera sculpture is supremely tacky. 4) A bowling alley? A screening room with seats that become beds?? A wall of candy??? 5) No books. Anywhere. 6) Why all the giant displays everywhere — including outside the house? 7) Why were the bathrooms not shown? All of it gives me a slight impression that it was generated by AI. “It looks like a hotel, not a house where people live.” Maybe somebody will buy it and make the most expensive Airbnb property. Cleaning fees or requirements could address Rev’s questions about the maintenance expenses. The most likely customers/clients could be young professionals doing their “micro-retirement”. Turns out a lot was unexplained here. The “non-functional helicopter” was a collectible from a TV show. The house was indeed listed for $250 million, maybe as a publicity stunt, but then sold for a mere $94 million (chump change by comparison) way back in 2019. It’s been noted here about the muted colors in movies now, with technical explanations about post-production predominating. But comparing automobile colors from the ’70’s to now, what was day-glo has become dark-green being a bold individualistic statement. There’s more shine, but not more saturation. A main axis of the World Values Survey is ‘survival / self-expression’. Is it consumer preference driving the wash-out? Or is it, you’ll eat what you’re served? Images of traffic jams in Brazil (a high self-expression country) look as washed-out as here, so that indicates the latter. A brief walkthrough of a Kardashian mansion I saw had no color, only glass and white, and no individual signification. No family pictures on the wall, just corporate art. Lifeless. With respect to cars, in my experience, the cars that are black or white are the least expensive. The red, blue or sparkly paint cars also have more expensive equipment packages. The sparkly paint is also more expensive to repair as I learned when someone bonked into my car with black sparkly paint as I was putting kids and groceries in the car and then drove off The last car I have had that wasn’t black or white was in high school when I got my mother’s tan jeep as a hand me down. It includes a car collection so that’s pretty cool I suppose. Probably none that should be driven in public of course. I get the bowling alley portion of the video clip, and I’m immediately reminded of the brutal and ultimate ending scene from what I call an epic film, There Will Be Blood. “I’m finished!” I’m most interested in the non functioning helicopter, and if I have to buy the rest of the mansion to get it, so be it. There Will Be Blood is based on Edward Doheny, a ruthless oil man. To make amends later in life he paid for the building of a large Catholic church on Figueroa St in LA, wags at the time called it ‘Doheny’s Fire Escape’ as it was pretty certain he was going to hell~ His mansion is now owned by something like the actor’s guild. I was there for a screening way back when. Then there is the story of his family yacht. Back in the 60’s I rubbed some shoulders with some nichiren shoshu crazies that cooked up a scheme to start a revolution in Mexico. For the first step (don’t ask me why) they hijacked the Doheny yacht. They were hunted down by the coast guard and prosecuted for piracy and attempted murder and half s dozen other crimes.

Bring those Chinese kids in and save some money. It’s on the news. It was Clark Gable’s house. Beverly Hills. His widow refurbished it to sell it. This is on the news. re: US media How Public Media Lost The Federal Funding Battle, And What Happens Next To Stations, NPR And PBS https://deadline.com/2025/07/pbs-npr-funding-cut-explained-whats-next-1236461136/ Last time I looked every PBS program was preceded by a long list of oligarchs both living and dead who participated in its individual funding. Shouldn’t be too difficult to round up a few more to fill the funding gap. Look for the pinched reactionaries to next attack the NPR and PBS 501(c)3 status. What’s Ken Burns gonna do? I saw NPR manipulate a story to fit their agenda. They ignored facts and tried to inject uncertainty and doubt into an issue with which I was very familiar through work. That was years ago and they only got less objective and more obvious in their biases. Advice: Go to that permanent brunch and have another cocktail on their own nickel. Yesterday, while going to get our Muddy Fork croissants, the NPR man spoke of people who rode that plane, including Bill Clinton, who had ‘never been accused of any crimes.’ I’ve been used to the rhetorical twists. But to listen to him flat lie was the Timberlok in the coffin. Dan Schorr dies yet again. Stephen Colbert getting the axe. It’s unfortunate for the staff and apparently it was well staffed. I shed no tears, crocodile or other, for this individual. He turned into a political hack at best, far from his time at Comedy Central initially working for / with Stewart, then launching his own branded report show. Someone at that level and in a signficant role and time slot, well perhaps he and also the show writers, really could’ve done better than opening on a recurring “Two Minute hate speech” during the first Trump administration. Last year he did give a poignant, even heartfelt it seemed brief recap and memorial to country star Toby Keith. It started with an appearance by the Big Dog on the aforementioned CC show. Obviously the politics of these two entertainers varied quite much. And hey this proves the axiom, unless you own the company you can become expendable. Start a podcast…. everyone else has one. C’mon, man. Think of all the good things that Stephen Colbert has done that we can remember him by- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq76QSlRiPo (1:27 mins) I watched Colbert for a bit on Youtube back in 2016, when I followed American politics with interest. Soon came to the conclusion that it wasn’t for me. However, I did have a favourable impression of his immediate post-election performance. It had the air of someone talking shocked and anguished people off the ledge, which I do think is a good thing to do, even if the people in question and their tragedy are a little hard to take seriously. That said he also seemed to be the sort of entertainer who’s squarely oriented towards cheering up a particular political grouping, in his case the Democratic faithful, and not doing anything more interesting or complicated. Good for them (or perhaps bad now, but I doubt he’ll just disappear – he has talent for this specific thing he does). People like him are the part of the problem, doing brainwashing of the populace for the benefit of the “elite”, and hence the Guillotine Watch material. They deserve real axe. Staff too, because the “I was just following orders” talk works only in the minds of those saying it. I remember being astonished at public outlets going along with the dissing of Sanders, outright misleading of listeners, who went out and backed Clinton and Biden as ‘more electable’. How’s that working for ya, PBS? The high point of Colbert’s career IMO…His performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner 2006. He ultimately became the person he used to mock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-a2KeyCAY His brilliant best, relentlessly oblivious as his audience stopped laughing and viewers at home couldn’t stop. Turned out his advantage was playing a character, rather than being himself. I won’t miss him either but I’ll always miss his smug, glib blinkered alter ego. Re: How can Democrats win back working-class voters? Dream on. I have to admit that the first thought that popped into my mind in reading that headline was ‘How can cannibals stop being cannibals? By not eating people.’ Yeah, not going to happen. So, ‘How can Democrats win back working-class voters?’ By offering immediate material benefits to their lives. Also not going to happen. One concern I have is that Trump’s policies will make the status quo ante more appealing to voters. There are no cannibals in our village any more. We ate the last one yesterday. and then there’s this take-down of AOC by Caitlin Johnstone this morning – AOC is definitely honing her political chops and duplicity – https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2025/07/20/aoc-is-a-genocidal-con-artist/ reached out to share the AZ billboard of tRump from yesterday’s links with an acquaintance – her first response to me was, “I haven’t forgiven you yet for this past election. I’m sorry, but that’s how I feel” my transgression was not voting for Ms Giggles – my mistake was sharing for whom i did vote – and it wasn’t tRump – for some there is no hope and no rational debate – my daughter told me to just forget about political conversations with folks – shaking my head, she may be correct – Fetterman in disguise? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/30/cort-m30.html Never thought I would see the day where I was disappointed that AOC would vote against MTG. But here we are noticed in the MTG clip that she was disturbed by the fact that Israelis have Universal Healthcare and Subsidized College – would be interesting if she followed up on those too – does MTG not have an AIPAC handler? Re: AOC- I’m thinking AOC has dreams of becoming the future Nancy Pelosi with all the attached grift. So disappointing, along with Sanders. AOC’s concern that the Israelis need the money to buy more “defensive” weapons so they can protect themselves just helps Israel to fulfill the “Plan” to destroy Gaza and wage destruction across the Mideast. In the words of Mike Tyson ” Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face”. AOC’s “eat the rich” dress during the early stages of an ongoing Pandemic worn during a high end who’s who social event was by that point all anyone needed to know about how shallow and duplicitous she is. Leftists shouldn’t hate AOC less than the politicians to her right, they should hate her much more. It isn’t Mike Johnson’s responsibility to move the US government to the left, and it’s not Nancy Pelosi’s job. It’s hers. That’s what she was elected to do. That’s what she framed the goals of her entire political career as being. And she’s taking her stand firmly bracing against any leftward movement from America’s genocidal, warmongering, unjust, exploitative, tyrannical status quo. And this is why I particularly despise liberal Democrats. Republicans are at least honest about what they’re about. Democrats are “working tirelessly for a ceasefire” lol. Although when it comes to the Pandemic, an ongoing threat to the working class and humanity, most Leftists are missing in action as well. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. So what passes for the Left in America isn’t really useful for much of anything, either. That is the Left as defined by the Right, and the “two” right-wing “parties” are in cahoots here: the right-wing left is very useful to the ruling caste, as the article posted by Jabura Basadai illustrates well. The Left that considers itself not to be liberal Democrats also abdicated any responsibility towards protecting the working class from an ongoing Pandemic. Find me any not-liberal-Democrat leftist blogger or podcaster that acknowledges the ongoing Pandemic. I’ll wait. UK reduces voting age to 16, aims to boost electoral participation – Scripps News Time for Semper to post the movie “Wild In The Streets”? :) Every satire and cautionary tale is becoming non-fiction/documentaries. If you become an adult at 16, then you can be enlisted and sent to fight and die at 16. Zelensky liked that. In the UK, you can sign the papers at 15 and join at 16! So your comment is sadly true enough. When people called for them to be aligned, they were thinking of the higher number…. At the same time, we are seeing the long infantilisation of the WEIRD adults. People do not form independent lives, households etc until 30+, instead living an extended adolescence through university. Indeed university itself is now being required to act in loco parentis of ostensible adults (there is a long and very sad campaign by parents of student suicides to force UK universities to do more bit the fundamental problem is 18 year olds are adults and if they want to fuck up, neither their parents nor an institution can or should babysit them; NB: this campaign is not about fixing negligent mental health care but about extending pastoral supervision). As a result, we should probably be *raising* the UK voting age to 25 or 30! What are the demographics for the 16 and under cohort in the UK? From the sad crime stories in big cities and economic distress everywhere, what are the risks of a surprising, non-Britishy result or two from the Council level on up the ladder? How soon will there be a Polymarket or similar betting pool on issues? Recently I’ve become of the opinion that voting age should be in fact raised to 40 to be honest. At 25 I was a veteran of three wars, two coup-de-tats, and several covert actions. I lacked educational experience but obtained my bachelors by 30. At 25, I had something to say based upon real-world experience, and believe me I would have said it if I could only articulate it well. All I had was my vote. Decades later I come across people far older than I– in their 60s, 70s, 80s– who have a child-like, simplified view of the world without the nuance and understanding that I had obtained by the age of 25, and you’re telling me that the voting age matters? Good point. Voters should be 25-65. We have had 16+ voting age in Scotland for about a decade, for the devolved Edinburgh but not Westminster government. I was fortunate enough to teach Modern Studies, aka Civics, at secondary level and even my cohort of 13 year olds were more thoughtful about voting than many adults. Age is not the most useful metric for being sensible enough to be trusted to vote. The youngsters all took their democratic privileges very seriously. Media disinformation and bias, plus the lying scum in the political class are the biggest drawback to sensible exercise of the vote, with 47 the porkiest pie teller I have ever encountered Re Did Trump Play a Role in Colbert–not only does the article not answer its own question but it also ignores the fact that Colbert was a government promoting outlet for his good friend Biden until last January. Additionally any broadcast outlet is by definition a government partner since their license grants them what was once a triopoly status and the ability to print money. That’s not nearly as true as it once was and for sure it was the Republicans who tossed the Fairness Doctrine. But one should certainly not judge the opportunist Colbert to be some kind of noble figure. For people like him it’s easy to be smug when you are preaching to the converted. Indeed your rice bowl depends on it. We do need the media to keep the elites honest but in that increasingly ownership restricted space there is little to keep them honest. One might even argue that’s the bigger problem. I read somewhere the show has been losing money for a long time. He was cancelled, not due to the losses of money, but because Trump wanted him gone. The same will happen to all the others that speak out against the Nazi regime. Losing money is just an excuse and not true. He should have never been canceled because he has the highest viewership of any of them, and is one of the greatest late night comedians ever. So I am told. Yea, and proof that propaganda works. From this side of the Atlantic, he seems as grindingly predictable in his gags and idées reçues as the “alternative” comedians were in the UK during the Thatcher years. Some of these were very funny and insightful people (Alexei Sayle) but not when they were on primetime. He is no loss. Amusingly, Trump seems to be the first President to generate the bent-out-of-shape media hatred that Thatcher did in the UK. She too was an arriviste vulgarian. So we can’t have an equal and opposite to Fox’s Hannity or so many other fox celebs beating the GOP drum? I don’t recall Colbert ever being successfully sued for falsehoods or various improprieties like Fox. I stopped watching Colbert when it got less satire and more cheer leading but as it is not fraudulent it should be taken as part of the political discourse however blinkered. I started to go down the rabbit hole to test the waters, primarily suits filed by X against channel this that and the other. Omg and SMH, it’s a list of law suits alright and likely one I can’t summarize well or with precision. I will likewise suggest, certain media channels proved their loyalty when they disquieted the notion of say for one example, the Hunter Biden laptop. Trump is a narcissist, this is a given. Fox news can spew a ton on information at the core audience and just on the other aisle, I’d argue that CNN or MSNBC have done and will continue as well. By the way, what is Don Lemon up to these days anyway? Oh, and Jake Tapper wrote a book to help assuage his hand in the ” Biden is mentally healthy and fully aware. “. Ugh, much of it requires a double take on most days. Other countries most likely have their news, the US has a large contingent of stenographers. Pick your favorite flavor of Kool Aid. And to add, the likes of a Sean Hannity, a Rachel Maddow, and until next May at least Stephen Colbert are paid quite well. My point is, as Mencken said, don’t underestimate the stupidity of the American electorate. So there are plenty supplying the koolaid. They are paid. Money is now speech. Just be glad there are still two major sides vying. When one side can shut down the other and instill loyalty oaths for law enforcement then we might be in trouble. Oh wait! I will concede you make a good counter point. We’re not yet at the level of say, Carnegie and his massive steel plants hiring Pinkerton’s to fire on the unruly mob of non union workers….not quite yet at any rate. To borrow a classic phrase generally attributed to financier Jay Gould, ” I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half…”. As someone else in comments often puts it, this timeline is lit. I agree, I shed no tears for Colbert himself. As soon as he hit the big time he was just another boot licker For the establisment elites. Quit watching him and the others a long time ago. Late night show comedians have not been funny or entertaining for years. A coupla years ago they had these American late night show comedians on late TV here in Oz as cheap fill. It was just garbage from end to end and I would rather watch an ancient rerun of Red Skelton and Jack Benny instead. At least they were funny. Benny Hill in 2028! Sure, he’s British and dead, but those things don’t seem to matter anymore in American politics. Absolutely Benny Hill and the only reason I did not mention him was because he was British. He was rude, crude, vulgar and sexist – and absolutely hilarious- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1FBqFOTLQ (4:34 mins) His life’s work reminds me of a tombstone I read about upon which the following words were carved- ‘R.I.P Here lies my Husband, he was Dishonest, erratic, Erotic, irresistable, Wanton, untrustworthy And a liar. Sadly missed by his Everloving wife.’ I had a feeling you and he got along. I’m a bit young to have followed him in real time, but I eventually caught up. Peace. Stephen Colbert was actually very, very funny in Strangers With Candy, a sitcom starring Amy Sedaris as a 40-something former addict and prostitute who returns to high school (Colbert plays a neurotic [and gay] teacher having a long running affair with a colleague). He did a great job as a “reporter” on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, way back when it was still funny, and invented a twisted conservative talk host persona for The Colbert Report – that show was likely the height of his talent expression. I still don’t understand what happened to his edge. There’s a clip of Amy Sedaris on The Late Show getting interviewed by him, both of them reminiscing about their débuts in the business, living in relative poverty, and you can see some of the real man revealed for a moment. And then it evaporates. Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner was when he peaked in my view. Actually making light of the sitting, war mongering, USA president (Bush II) and toady journalists, who were in attendance. Courageous stuff, given the potential for revenge from the targets of his humor. This version of Colbert may have simply been a product of his writers, and not evidence of a critical, independent, thinker one could respect. But one can be sure he banked a lot of coin in his career. I think it is not really such a wonder that a strongly Democratic-aligned comic would courageously assail some Republicans. Nor is it in any way incompatible with his career since then. Stewart was funny back in the day. Carolinian Colbert played a parody rightwinger on that show and later on his own Comedy Central show. Perhaps it’s an indication of his true lack of bite that the latter was surprisingly popular among conservatives. I’ve always thought his comedy was more pandering than satire but that’s just me. Lenny Bruce he is not. The pandering got worse when he made the big time at CBS. And to say he’s better than his lame late night competition is not much of a boost. The funniest thing from Jon Stewart is when he presented a medal to a Nazi at the Disney World. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFpHtufCIZ4 Re; People Are Becoming Obsessed with ChatGPT and Spiraling Into Severe Delusions “…Vasan agrees that OpenAI has a perverse incentive to keep users hooked on the product even if it’s actively destroying their lives.” “The incentive is to keep you online,” she said. The AI “is not thinking about what is best for you, what’s best for your well-being or longevity… It’s thinking ‘right now, how do I keep this person as engaged as possible?'” We’ve seen this before, and many of us here likely have experienced lost or ruined relationships in our lives because of it: Facebook’s ethical failures are not accidental; they are part of the business model Facebook’s stated mission is “to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” But a deeper look at their business model suggests that it is far more profitable to drive us apart. By creating “filter bubbles”—social media algorithms designed to increase engagement and, consequently, create echo chambers where the most inflammatory content achieves the greatest visibility—Facebook profits from the proliferation of extremism, bullying, hate speech, disinformation, conspiracy theory, and rhetorical violence. Facebook’s problem is not a technology problem. It is a business model problem.

The process is an A/B testing group which measures how long the user stays at the site and there is only one measure anybody cares about and that is to keep them online. Like the old casino manager instruction to keep them playing. Ghislaine Maxwell believed Trump would save her, now she’s documenting everything behind bars: jail source- NY Post That’s cool. She gets writing tools that can be used to make shanks. That’s some self-protection. Supposedly she had already been moved to a cushy white collar crime type facility where shankings are rare. As for The New Republic up in Links, Max Blumenthal on a podcast asked why the Dems hadn’t used Epstein against Trump long before and that’s an interesting question. I probably follow the news more than your average MAGA but didn’t know that Trump and Epstein were15 year bosom buddies. This weekend’s NYT story even cites an incident where Epstein brought one of his girls up to Trump Tower for a visit. It’s impossible that Trump didn’t know what was going on and suspicions that he participated need only the slightest verification. Hubris meets nemesis. On the plus side Mrs. Vance will make a nice first lady. Sooner than we think? Well Max Blumenthal should know that the reason why the Dems could never use Epstein against Trump and the Repubs as doing so would burn a lot of their own donors. And it would certainly drag down Bill Clinton as he used to take flights on the Lolita Express which would also mean that Hillary Clinton would get dragged down as well. In wrecking the Repubs, the Dems would wreck themselves so we have a MAD situation here. Dems are as involved with Epstein, etc as the RINOs. When does US stop suffering pedophiles? How do we become a sane nation? When do we insist our weapons not be used for genocide? Probably, at least 10 or 20 years after we stop rewarding calculating, ruthless, back-stabing, greed driven psychopaths to promotions on the ladder towards CEO. We bemoan the ethical and wisdom lapses up at the top of the pyramid, and ignore that the entire base of the pyramid is infested by equally poor barely human specimens. The rot goes all the way down. It’s as if the proverbial small town used car salesman or crooked sheriff broke out of their niche and infected the rest of the population. Time for society to have a hard look in the mirror. This is what ‘we’ want, apparently, since it’s what ‘we’ reward. Thank you for writing this, cfraenkel. In my opinion, the role of the US population in US decline warrants far more discussion. I believe the US population is not just a passive victim, but in many cases an active participant, e.g. by continuing to refuse to hold the people that have been wrecking the country for decades now accountable in any meaningful way. At the very least, more people could stop legitimizing the current system by refusing to vote, but even that is apparently too much to ask. So we get the “leaders” we deserve, I guess. Leaders in Washington and State capitals who ignore their constituents and grovel for money by selling their souls to high bidders, and the occasional blackmailer! Make the processes transparent and auditable. Maybe one of the brewing scandals will help clean out Washington for a new crew. In my opinion, that’s wishful thinking at this point. I suggest we use our power over our own actions to withhold our consent to be governed. Votes can still be manufactured of course, but at least our conscience will be clean. Re: Human Programmer beats OpenAI (op cit) Gimme a break. Tom’s Hardware doesn’t give details about the challenge’s challenges, but it seems I first encountered this kind of problem (“dynamic programming”) back ca. 1980, matching speech signals to targets, and it was already an old problem, a variant of the “traveling salesman problem” in which a self-driving car has to cross Manhattan.

That big platform reaches a huge audience, non-geriatrics and those who don’t watch the shrinking nightly news. ‘Science girl @gunsnrosesgirl3 Jun 17 kindergarten lessons in China’ It’s a fascinating view of how another country sees education. The idea seems to be to make those kids self sufficient from an early age and develop their hand-eye coordination. It’s almost a meme how guys right out of high school have no idea about cooking and will just go for Door Dash instead or get their moms to make them something. Of course the comments for that video clip are mixed and some are really experiencing sour grapes- https://xcancel.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1935044059506295111 In USA they skip the manufacturing, and sent kids directly to sales and other services. Seems like a Chinese reinvention of Montessori…my kids did a lot of similar stuff, though definitely not at such a high throughput rate! I immediately thought the same thing: Montessori school with Chinese characteristics. Which is definitely cool. I’m sure there are reasons (maybe some cynical), but I’ve never understood why no country has ever tried just mainlining Montessori education into most of their schools. Hope there is a good Emergency Room nearby. Wonder how liability law works in China? I became a “latch-key kid” around that age, long before ambulance-chasers and St. Reagan’s intrusive nanny-state/authoritarian police state started sucking the life out of… well, pretty much everything. We’ve become a society of pussies where any risk is unacceptable to many– even calculated ones: pain, real pain, can be a valuable teacher, and I’m not talking about hurt feelings here (although those can have value too). Those kids are starting much earlier in life than ours, learning self-suffiency and skills necessary for “adulting,” things that many of our man-childs and 40-50 y.o. “girls” have never, and won’t ever, learn. I am impressed by what I see in the video, and am saddened by what I see being done to our youth as they are encouraged to distance themselves even further from life’s realities than even their parents likely are.

The Verge Acceleration is not only about power-to-weight ratio, but also rubber meeting the road. In addition to that, going fast is not only about accelerating, but also slowing down. Small wheels (and small brakes) are inherently bad at that, because they are small. A team of ex-Formula One engineers knows that, which means they are just talking the talk for publicity. Also, the smaller the diameter of the wheel the higher the rpm, so going fast on these would probably require Formula One level maintenece.

Just out of curiosity, are there many people here with enough money to spare that they need to find something to do with it, who don’t invest in something unethical? Starting a new job, and at a stage where the basics in life are sorted, and have the nice problem of not knowing what I will do with the money (which of course I will need to in-part use for retirement some day) – but after years of reading NC and the ills of ‘money making money’ in general etc. – am kind of paralyzed as to what to actually do with it, which isn’t going to be investing in something unethical one way or the other. So am curious if there are people who have successfully navigated this, and are doing well, without selling their soul and ‘buying in’ to one variety of evil or other, with their investments. Whether it is actually practically doable. I’m becoming more convinced that this is one of the ways – maybe even one of the primary ways – that economic conservatives and exploitative capitalists, achieve ‘buy in’ and votes among so much of the population: Corrupting their ethics/morals, through gains from unethical investments (that many people are not even initially aware they are investing in, e.g. hidden/obscured in pension portfolio company lists). Plenty of people turned off by the financial markets have sought to invest money in real estate; local rentals, AirBnBs, or flips, or land speculation. Which, perversely, has turned questionably ethical over the last 20 years, because these little real estate empires, along with the corporate ones, have jacked up prices and rents, and made affordable housing scarcer. Yet if you don’t want to invest in stocks and bonds, it would still certainly be wise to secure paid-off housing in an area you won’t mind living in if society ever goes seriously off the rails. I have long held a certain interest in local or state run credit unions, many of which have a local or regional tie to a former corporation or industry affiliation. Many of these succeeded as a basic truly co-operative, the largest are known by their TV ads or a sponsorship of a local arena perhaps. Navy Federal is a real big one. But as I’ve found before you just need to check around for one that suits your needs for competitive money market rates or even CD offerings. Making a key assumption here, this is a US focused inquiry. One minor note, free advice is often worth the price (!) In addition to local credit unions, there is a new category of socially and/or environmentally oriented financial service companies that are certified by the federal government if they invest primarily in local low-income markets. There are 1500 of them that specialize in lending to entities the banks either can not or choose not to reach….due to lower loan size or somewhat greater risk. The field is attracted talent and you can lend to them or deposit (if they are regulated. Most are non profit but some are small banks or credit unions. Meant to say, they are called “Community Development Financial Institutions” or CDFIs. There are project-specific municipal bonds. You’d be basically lending a city money for a project which you’d be able to get information about, at interest. If you don’t want to pay police salaries, for example, you could buy bonds for a park project. They have the added benefit of being one of the safer places to keep your money; cities rarely default. I’m glad you bring this up. The old standby, ‘no ethical consumption under capitalism’ comes to mind, though here we’re talking investing, not consumption. My own thinking for small-time retail investors is similar to my thinking on boycotts: individual choice in the market is not how social change happens, and the ownership of the stock market is so highly concentrated that the little guys making money adding their small savings to finance ugly business makes little difference, except in that it makes life easier for them. Interesting theory about the compromises we make for more money inculcating cynical, self-serving and immoral behavior. I wish you well, and hope that if you find another route, you’ll share! – ‘The CIA Initiated an Intelligence and Terrorist War on Russia Based on a Lie’ – Larry Johnson I somehow missed the original article by Tim Weiner in Foreign Policy that is the subject of this piece. I had just read it this morning (it was linked at MofA) and saw Johnson’s rejoinder here. I’m not sure if it was linked in NC earlier, but everyone should read it. It is quite extraordinary for all the reasons Larry points out and more. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such an unintentionally revealing article about an important subject (the CIA’s Russia House and its role in Ukraine) and also its author. If there were any doubts that Weiner is a complete “toady” for the CIA (to use Weiner’s own term), this article should dispel them. Unfortunately, because of all the despicable current actions by the Trump administration from Gaza to Ukraine to Epstein to DOGE to etc,.etc., it will be hard to take seriously any real “revelations” about Russiagate made by any of them. They will simply be seen as partisan rhetoric to deflect attention from Trump’s own evil actions (all of the sudden Gabbard has reappeared from oblivion to carry out this task for the MAGA faithful). And this will probably be correct. A curse on all their houses. Small ray of hope: Trump disses neo-con killapalooza: https://thehill.com/homenews/5410319-trump-administration-turns-hostile-on-aspen-security-forum/ LOL! Trump probably didn’t realize that he would be praised at the conference by Condi Rice for his recent “aggressive stance on Putin,” according to the article from The Hill posted above. A “bipartisan” conference of leading foreign policy elites. At the “Aspen Security Forum.” A panel “moderated by NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.” How could the Trump administration resist such an opportunity to share their views with the “foreign policy community”? >Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943 “Both [Poland and Ukraine] are modern European democracies that can handle an objective investigation of past atrocities in ways that a country like Russia unfortunately can not,” he said. Any article about Ukraine’s dark past must conclude with a condemnation of modern-day Russia. Ya gotta love how they take every possible opportunity to promote the bald-faced lie that Ukraine is a democracy, a modern, functional country. Before the SMO, it was “Europe’s most corrupt country” and “plagued by Neo-nazi nationalist movements”. Of course that’s all down the memory hole. Britain faces a test of identity: Will Britons become a minority in their homeland? – opinion Jerusalem Post https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-861437 The Jerusalem Post is concerned that young British Muslims are going on camps where some form of indoctrination apparently takes place. I remember going on a boy scout camp when I was 12 and we were fed tales of the Empire and the need to maintain our right control our our colonies as a Christian mission, forced to wear funny caps, scarves and toggles at all times, and listening to lots of Methodist guff around the campfire every evening. I buggered off home on the third day thumbing lifts all the way to my house and told my parents I had no intention of ever having anything to do with the scouts after that. I left the scouts and a couple of lads followed my lead because we saw the camp for what it was – a primer for the our right to defend the imperial system agin’ the dirty rat-fink commie coloureds in the colonies who wanted rid of our lovely Monarchy and Parliament. The Jews have their own indoctrination systems for young people which have had a much more serious negative impact on British, European and Amercan politics since the 1930s and which intensified after the war with the legitimisation of the settler colony. I find the idea that we will be outnumbered by Muslims in our own home less than likely purely on the basis of the demographics. I’m much more worried by the example set by Jewish and Christian Zionists in their wholehearted support for the Palestinian genocides than I am about Muslim girls’ fashion choices when camping, and the perspective that many Muslims and non-Muslims have on the political élite of the West given their open support for the deliberate murder and maiming of children who are inconveniently Palestinian by bombs, bullets and starvation – and it’s resulting power as a new iteration of the blood libel. The Zionists are attempting to extend their landholding by soaking it in the blood of the children they have sacrificed, and the blood they continue to sacrifice until they are stopped by military force as they continue to overreach, along with the Collective West by deploying the rundown Anglo-Saxon and European armouries. There was an interesting article featured in the links yesterday and one section really disturbed me. ” In response to a question in The Brothers Karamazov about whether Jews steal and kill Christian children at Easter, Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know”. That is quite the glib treatment of blood libel.” https://unherd.com/2025/07/why-gen-z-goes-mad-for-dostoyevsky/?us=1 On the contrary, it was a profound treatment of the extent of one’s knowledge and the nature of truth which gave me great pause and resulted in many discussions with my fellows when I was a nineteen year old student. “…Alyosha replies with a simple “I don’t know””. How can he know? What other answer can an honest man give? A convenient yes or no, expressing belief without authority, or “well I’m rather a bit of a sceptic about that, actually, old boy”, depending on the audience, or just speak the bare unvarnished truth. My reading and re-reading of Dostoevsky in many different translations over the years have merely reinforced my belief that the position taken by Alyosha is morally and intellectually correct. For the honest, it must always be the bare unvarnished truth – and that is something which seems to have got lost somewhere in my lifetime. I agree on that last part, and I think the author’s idea there was that one is supposed to always express the prescribed morally correct opinion on such things. Never mind that this prescribed morally correct opinion was not widely accepted at the time, and at any rate would indeed not have been honest (even moreso in the drastically different informational environment of 19th century Russia). Alyosha’s answer is not merely a morally correct one, but also a scientifically correct one–and one thst dovetails nicely with the Grand Inquisitor’s line (from the samd novel, obviously): all too often, we are too sure that everythingbwe think we know is “two times two,” just a matter of “mathematics” and selff evident truth. The situation is so bad in the West that even George Orwell fell into this mental trap. Something else was wrong with this Jerusalem Post article about the UK other then the jncongruity (seriously, Israeli commentary on UK social conditions? There’s no interest in Israel in Blighty’s crumbs. If they need a surveillance overflight from Cyprus, they can order it via Uncle Sam!) and that was the claim that Andrew Bridgend gave a speech in Parliament that 80% of thrle 250,000 rapes have been by Muslims. If he had said that, it would have been front-page news and I don’t remember it. Have I I just missed a memo? Does anybody else remember this? Or is this just more hasbara against muslims…? “Genocide or tragedy? Ukraine, Poland at odds over Volyn massacre of 1943” Yeah, the Poles are not going to forget the Volyn massacre – nor should they. There are about 100,000 Poles buried in mass unmarked graves and the Poles want their remains exhumed. Needless to say the Ukrainians are not thrilled at this idea. Polish President Andrzej Duda got stuck into Zelensky about this massacre so of course Zelelnsky played dumb saying- ‘Andrzej, I’ve never heard of the murders, the killing of Poles in western Ukraine, in Volhynia. They didn’t teach us about it in school.’ https://www.rt.com/news/621319-zelensky-never-heard-nazi-crimes/ But the Poles will not let this go and it was only several years ago that they made a film about what happened back then- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0POxClxb8cM (1:00 min) Climate change as existential threat– However you want to define it, climate change constitutes a threat of catastrophe for humans and other life on Earth of almost inconceivable dimensions. Recent estimates for impacts on humans and their economy may not be existential, but they project a Mad Max world with billions of dead, billions more desperately seeking to migrate, drastic reductions in GDP far beyond that experienced in the Great Depression and unpredictable and deadly geopolitical and sociopolitical conflicts. Driving this disaster is a grotesque misallocation of wealth, income and consumption. Fifty per cent of carbon emissions are attributable to the world’s richest 10%. Moreover, in the USA, 50% of consumption comes from the richest 10%. This distorts the production of goods and services so that we have too little housing, health care, food and education for the poor, both in the Global North and Global South, and way too much in the way of affluent consumption like McMansions, SUVs, non-essential travel and boob jobs. Put succinctly, we’re burning up the planet to cater to the spoiled rich and affluent while billions go without basics worldwide. Thanks, capitalism. Economic anthropologist Jason Hickel and Australian Dylan Sullivan published a paper in World Development Perspectives last September that laid out a plan for change that would avoid a catastrophic breaching of Earth’s boundaries while eliminating global poverty: Strategies for development should not pursue capitalist growth and increased aggregate production as such, but should rather increase the specific forms of production that are necessary to improve capabilities and meet human needs at a high standard, while ensuring universal access to key goods and services through public provisioning and decommodification. At the same time, in high-income countries, less-necessary production should be scaled down to enable faster decarbonization and to help bring resource use back within planetary boundaries. With this approach, good lives can be achieved for all without requiring large increases in total global throughput and output. Provisioning decent living standards (DLS) for 8.5 billion people would require only 30% of current global resource and energy use, leaving a substantial surplus for additional consumption, public luxury, scientific advancement, and other social investments. No, it will not put a Ford Expedition in every McMansion garage nor a porterhouse on every grill, but it will meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for everyone (as adopted by Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics) as it solves our society-disrupting inequality. I encourage readers to check out Hickel’s and Sullivan’s paper while suspending questions of political feasibility. Does it seem plausible otherwise that the move toward eco-socialism could end the charge over the cliff while providing a decent life for everyone on the planet? Is there anything truly necessary or essential that would be lost? If the plan strikes you as reasonable, what, or more accurately who, blocks its adoption? i’m, of course, all for it. but literally everyone i know in real life would be absolutely terrified and/or enraged….the 100 year Mindf^ck about what socialism, etc actually is…or could be…has been very effective. True enough. But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them. One of the big problems is the array of forces that have expended great effort and huge sums of money aimed at planting just enough doubt in people’s minds to give them cover to roll with Business As Usual. The people behind that will have those billions who die on their karma. And before long, that sharp down slope is coming anyway. This just keeps the party going for 10% of the world’s population a little longer. “But I do think people care about their kids and grandkids. No one wants that kind of world for them.” But do they really care enough? Most I know bury their head in the sand, outright deny the issues, or brand them a liberal hoax. The “aware” parents are mainly focused on setting their kids up to be the fortunate ones who will have the resources to rise above the rabble in hard times. That said, even if they really do care enough I don’t know what they can really do about it. Are they gonna raise their kid to be a survivalist? Raise them in a eco commune? We all feel powerless to change anything systemic so why not raise kids to be successful capitalists so that they will hopefully be on top when the pyramid scheme of modern society collapses. Better odds that way. As was said above, our best hope is to somehow radically reform incentive structures but in a society where public grocery stores in NYC is branded a communist takeover, feeding the homeless can be a crime, and healthcare for sick children is controversial, I highly doubt we are capable of anything remotely resembling a system that rewards those who do work benefitting others. Even if we could we’d need to get people like Jamie Dimon to accept he is in fact not doing God’s work. A while back a younger friend asked me if I thought we could ever make the changes needed to become a better society. I said, “Sure. We’ve done it before. All it took was two world wars and a Great Depression for western society to make some positive lasting systemic changes.” Or, as the quote often misattributed to Churchill goes, “We always do the right thing after we’ve exhausted every other possibility.” “20-Million-Year-Old Rhino Fossil Rewrites Evolutionary History” Wouldn’t it be fascinating if they found the body of a frozen North American Indian in the permafrost from 30,000 years ago when the first of them were arriving in this empty double continent. Think about what could be revealed by an analysis if their teeth and what it would tell us of who these first people were. There were a few findings along those lines, eg the Kennewick Man. People took them and their implications badly and the inconvenient findings were literally buried with claims that they were inconclusive, using the laws originally created to prevent grave robbing of old Native American burial grounds. Yes, when fossil evidence goes against dogma, it takes a long time for it to be considered evenhandedly. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/jacques-cinq-mars-bluefish-caves-scientific-progress-180962410/ I see what you mean- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man re: WWII interview German blog NACHDENKSEITEN has a long interview with WWII historian Paul Chamberlain. If interested use google to translate (archive.is wouldn´t work today) Interview with Paul Chamberlin: The Second World War as a war of racist empires – on both sides Paul Thomas Chamberlin is a professor of history at Columbia University and a renowned expert on 20th century international history. His writing has appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post , among others . He is the author of the highly acclaimed book “The Cold War’s Killing Fields,” in which he reveals the bloody global dimension of the Cold War. In his new work, “Scorched Earth: A Global History of World War II,” Chamberlin takes a radically different look at the Second World War: not as a battle between good and evil, but as a brutal conflict between imperial powers – on all sides. He shows that the Allies and the Axis powers were often frighteningly similar in their colonial ideology, their war crimes, and their treatment of the civilian population. In this interview, he talks about repressed chapters of war history – and why the Second World War must be retold. The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 More like that’s a new idea for some European historians and students… I think the myth that WW2 was a moral crusade against fascism, rather than a struggle between self-interested states, is not going to die any time soon. After all, people have been refuting it since the event itself, and any serious examination of it would point towards a more critical view as well. (A more critical view that, it ought to go without saying, does not mean it would’ve been better or even just as bad if the Axis powers had won.) An even worse version I see from time to time (though notably always in English, not Russian) is that WW2 was fought to save the Jews from the Nazis – judged by that standard, though, it was not very successful. Not to mention that back during WW2 that was the line of the Nazis and their sympathisers (I remember Mosley writing to that effect, for example), not of their opponents. Pardon my cynicism, but it seems to me that a lot of people throughout the Western world and (with some tweaks) in the former USSR want to believe in the Good War in which the Good Guys beat the Bad Guys, without any ambiguities or complications. It is both genuinely reassuring to the people and very useful to the powers that be and their intellectual support, who keep finding new Hitlers to oppose. The Allies’ actions such as air bombings and ethnic cleansing are very useful in that regard too: if it was okay for Good Guys to do it then, it is this much harder to complain about them doing it to someone else now. I suppose it still does some good to keep restating it and providing further proof, even if the basic thesis here seems so obvious that its rejection must be rooted in psychological and political factors that aren’t susceptible to arguments or evidence. I think this linecof thinking goes back ultimately to the notion of so called “just war” itself, as that implies that there are some wars, if the cause is just enough, that you ought to be proud of. Since wars invariably turn “evil” in its conduct on all sides (atrocities against civilians, hypocrisy, etc), this gives justification to the excuses that these evils are justified because they were doing greater good, the other side deserved them, etc., feeding even more hypocrisy. It would be far more honest if we could just fess up that, no matter what, to war is to sin and to sin gravely, and that we should try to minimize the evil that we do nevertheless and hope that God, if there is one, will forgive us, with the recognition that such forgiveness is not guaranteed. The trouble with the modern Christianity, at least the way it has developed in the West, is that we have lost the idea of sinning, at least when it is we who sin. Instead, we think of ourselves as instruments of divine justice, and so doing, mistake ourselves for God. Excellent diagnosis. re: WWIII RU – Pascal Lottaz from Neutrality Studies interviews Dmitri Trenin. Martyanov used to not regard Trenin as a real expert in military affairs. Which he probably is not as far as real professionals are concerned. I already wrote that it is odd if one particular individual is always being inquired on a variety of highly special subjects when it comes to a certain larger power regarded as hotile. 35 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giN29jR7VRc I always thought that was funny because, iirc, Trenin was a GRU colonel and presumably, a graduate of the General Staff Academy, too. Martyanov is a bit too full of hinself more often than not. RE: Barack Obama Now Squarely in Russiagate Crosshairs Matt Taibbi I have no clue where this will go, but I’m guessing nowhere, like most other things I wish would actually go somewhere. These people don’t care about laws – they don’t apply to them. I would be nice to see St. Obama get what is due, but I won’t hold my breath. What will be interesting is the spin and lies. I have been gone so I have not talked to my PMC friends, but I’m guessing they won’t/don’t believe one bit of it. After all, Tulsi is a Russian asset according to Hillary and most of blue MAGA believe that. Russia is also controlling Trump so this is all lies and nothing could be true. They have too much invested in Russiagate and of course they can never admit they were wrong. But it would be nice, in this case, the Epstein case, or many other cases, these slimeballs would actually get what they deserved. But they won’t. They will continue to laugh in our face and get away with whatever they want. That’s one of the perks of being in the Big Club. I think it has already been decided by the highest court that Obama can’t be prosecuted for official acts but it is exciting to think that if associated persons can be prosecuted at this late date for said same then just maybe we can prosecute the war crimes of the Bush era. Arguably the bigger slimeballs than mere election meddlers. Agreed. Would love to see this heat brought upon the clan behind the biggest crimes of my lifetime. Can’t stand Obama and his “high priest of brunch” status but I’m old enough to remember Trump’s team of investigators who were going to expose the fake birth certificate. Not exactly a guy with a reputable track record on this and an odd one for Taibbi to be hitching his hopes to. https://www.civilbeat.org/2011/04/10184-trump-sends-birther-investigators-to-hawaii/ Christine Hunsicker, CEO of a Bankrupt Fashion Tech Startup, Charged for Alleged $300M Fraud Scheme -People Of course, I had to check to see if she had ever been a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum. That has previously appeared on some high-profile rap sheets. She wasn’t, but did make something called Crain’s New York Business “40 under 40”. https://fortune.com/2025/07/19/fashion-entrepreneur-caastle-fraud-charges-investors-300-million/ A one-time ’40 under 40′ rising star in fashion pleads not guilty to charges she allegedly cheated investors out of $300 million >‘Great British Energy solar panels’ were made in China Labour MP Sarah Champion said GB Energy should be buying solar panels from companies in the UK rather than China, where there have been allegations of forced labour in supply chains. “I’m really excited about the principle of GB Energy,” she told BBC News. “But it’s taxpayers’ money and we should not be supporting slave labour with that money. And wherever possible, we should be supporting good working practices and buy British if we can.” How many hospitals for Uyghurs have the Chinese bombed? What is her opinion on using British taxpayers’ money to support Israel? When I read ” Sub-Saharan Africa can’t afford to eat on a carbon diet”, I noticed that the article carefully zero-mentioned legume and non-legume bio-fixaton of nitrogen and also carefully zero-mentioned other soil-borne bio-fixation of nitrogen. It very carefully only mentioned the straw-man technology of electrolysis to produce “green” nitrogen. Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer and others ( so few that they can all be individually named) are getting yields comparable to the Haber-Bosch inputters without Haber-Bosch nitrogen OR strawman “green” nitrogen. African agriculturists could study Gabe Brown and Gary Zimmer if they want to and see whether such methods can be used in SSA agriculture to fix all the crop-growing nitrogen which SSA agriculture would need to keep SSA fed. +1 Even their discussion of urea carefully mentioned only manufactured sources. In today’s Clown World, why Putin should fear Britain’s next fighter jet. 🤡 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/19/britains-new-giant-jet-fighter-prepare-marathon-russia-raid/ If Nato ever ended up at war against Putin’s Russia, experts say this means the aircraft would take off from a British airfield, fly to Russia undetected, destroy hostile air defences and then fly all the way back again. What this article leaves out is that there would not be a Britain to return to for this Wunderwaffe if it somehow fulfilled its fantastical mission. The fact that such tripe gets published shows us that the mainstream media have nothing except pure contempt for the rubes who read them. At this stage, anyone still believing anything they tell us is an imbecile who needs minding. Given that the RAF Tempest is supposed to enter service in 2035, there may not be much of a Britain to even take off from by then. We’ll probably see a flying prototype of the Su-75 before a one for Tempest. Even if it looks like Rostec has frozen the Su-75 development for now – Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov did promise a flying prototype by the end of this year, but so far only crickets from Sukhoi. Perhaps the Brits will be using a design similar to this for those covert raids. H/T Chas Freeman, who mentioned this during his latest interview with Nima, which also featured Lawrence Wilkerson. When I see the things happening all around me in my own medical world, in other words, the frank incompetence that just was not present as recently as 10 years ago, I often wonder how things are going in other parts of the world and economy that are just as complicated as medicine. https://x.com/aviationbrk/status/1946596722496491582 It just happened yesterday. Accidents and issues like this in aviation seem to be happening at an extremely high rate compared to just a few years ago. I am not even sure this is a Boeing issue or a Delta maintenance issue? I am not even remotely expert to make that decision. But these kinds of things are seemingly happening at an alarming frequency. I honestly do not remember this level of accident happening just a few years ago. It seems to be happening weekly and that has been true for the past several years. I know in my world of medicine that this incompetence is actually happening. In aviation, is this type of thing becoming more common or is it that we are just seeing more of it because of iphone cameras and social media? I believe a major contributor to increased errors with airplanes, significant uptick in auto accidents, etc., is our old friend, SARS CoV 2 and The Long-Term Sequelae. ‘Gone from the charts (only because we stopped collecting data) but not from our hearts! Or brains . . . It might be the wonderful gift of private equity at work again: https://truthout.org/articles/as-us-airlines-outsource-plane-repairs-private-equity-is-moving-in/ That’s a 24 year old 767-400ER so it’s all about good maintenance. I had thought Delta was still doing it’s own maintenance: Delta TechOps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_TechOps But I think even the majors are having a hard time getting good experienced people to do the work. PE owned, or flying out of the country for heavy maintenance, let’s hope these do not become common practices. You would think our ruling elites would have figured out that off shoring, out sourcing is not always a smart thing to do by now, but greed seems to over rule all else with these people. Anybody who is anybody is flying private these days. The thrust of history now read out digitally. Compelling. Thank you! We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. If you follow airplanes and I do, there are many sites from around the world that keep track of issues that might require return to the airport. This is much more common than you think, while still being a small %. One issue with US carriers is that they have some of the oldest planes in the world. Older planes will have more issues as there is just more time on the airframe and engine. Yes they meet all the maintenance standards but well shit happens. It is definitely not a boeing issue, boeing doesn’t make engines. As to a delta issue, once the NTSB issues its report we will find out if it was a part failure, or maintenance issue or something else. For example we don’t know if this was a new or old engine, was it recently rebuilt or near needing overhaul, did it ingest a bird causing damage? Every single airliner issue is investigated and a conclusion arrived at. if it’s something new, then it might cause a new check or requirement for an updated check protocol. We are seeing more of it due to phones and cameras. This reminded me of Russians dashcam videos of accidents. Lots of those around, because there are lots of dashcams in Russia. Just to note, the synchronized dives were two sisters; Lia Yatzil Cueva Lobato Mia Zazil Cueva Lobato . . . and not the names shared in the tweet. Credit where due. They looked so remarkably similar that I wondered. I kinda thought that they looked like twins myself. I note that a piece from the “The Ecomodernist” is included in today’s links. Have a large load of salt handy before entering; this substack is just a rebranding of the old “Breakthrough Institute” which provided a platform for technocracy fanboys (Nordhaus et al.) A sampling of receipts available at: “The New Denial is Delay” Everyone Warned the Breakthrough Ecomodernists Hijacking ‘Anthropocene’: Anti-green ‘Breakthrough Institute’ misrepresents science Rachel Pritzker is co-author of “The Ecomodernist Manifesto” and the money behind the Breakthrough Institute. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” They’re telling us the boys from tech will handle it without more than wishful thinking to back it up. They’re not as crazy as the billionaires pushing “Longtermism.” Setting the bar pretty low! :) Anybody else going to Economic-Con? I’ll be doing cosplay as the total market value of the GDP, wearing thin. I’ll be going as the J P Morgan Silver Desk Jockey. You can’t miss me. I’ll be wearing paper shorts. Is this a thing? Could be, it’d be great fun. …what are you coming as? There are lies, damned lies and statistics…the Atlanta FED predicts the US is likely reflecting a rebound for the Q2 forecast…Funny but under a Democrat admin, a projected GDP at 2.0 to 2.5 was considered a positive goal. Opinions can vary! https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow Additionally, Islamic finance has its own rules, much-eroded by oil wealth and greed, but within Islam, interest is haram (there are ways around this), as is profiting from things like alcohol or pornography. There are some funds set up for the purpose of easing the consciences of Muslims, while providing them with passive income; you might look into those. How they deal with oil investing and the issues that faces us with, we’d have to check. But there’s another avenue to explore. Really, we’re dealing with our desire to gain without adding value by working. Poverty is probably purest (monks have long thought so), but everything costs money, and we can’t help others without standing on solid ground ourselves. How solid is solid enough? That’s personal preference, past a certain point. The other day, there was a piece hosted here by someone who had lived for years as a nomad. Others ‘need’ a certain quality in their food or shelter. Taking the extreme, if we were rapacious, and invested in everything ‘evil’ now, and it freed our comfortable retirements for volunteering our labor-time, would that justify having a portfolio of oil, weapons, tech, and drugs? No one wants their excess, if we have it, gnawed away by inflation. I really do look forward to hearing any thoughts you have on the subject. When we’re talking economic matters, it’s a shitty world, which we navigate but cannot, except in miniature, change. I’ve seen it said that the reason Trump is going after Brazil with tariffs is to put pressure on Lula, due to Bolsonaro’s ongoing Supreme Court case. Both are eyeball deep in the fundie evang crowd, discussed on NC years ago e.g. the actions of Bolsonaro’s mob in trying to keep power through violence. A new film on the Brazilian fundie Right has just become available via Netflix for those who subscribe. The director, Petra Costa, is interviewed here (go to 45:14). RE: 100 MPH Scooter: Where I live these scooters are being sold to unsuspecting users out of former rental company stock’s. Fortunately, these scooters are now categorized as transportation devices and regulated in the same category as ebikes: no riding on sidewalks; bike lane speed of 20 MPH; max electric motor power of 750 W; battery must conform to specific safety standards; rider/driver must follow existing vehicle code (citations start at $100 and increase in multiples—confiscation is allowed). The municipal code specifically disallows claims of poor infrastructure repair (potholes/crevices in roadway) for accident/damage. Ride at your Risk! The article about poor infrastructure in the US is interesting in that maintenance of infrastructure has puzzling qualities about it. A group of people get together and fund the construction of something that likely will outlast the builders. Their kids or grandkids then have to fix it or maintain it. They may have quite different interests or economics. Also, the technology used to build in the first place may be difficult to repair. I sometimes think that when something gets built it should be given an endowment. If you put a million dollars into a fund for a bridge then in 100 years that may become about a billion dollars and that would be enough to make substantial repairs if not replace it. The flaw in this idea is that if you set aside that much money in a public fund some grifter will come along and steal it. Something a little similar exists for certajn bridges in the UK. A college contemporary is a trustee of one of these foundations. Rochester (Kent) and Southwark (London) bridges also have them. The trustees were granted powers by Parliament like sui generis corporations, usually including the power of tolling. They also owned land, either adjacent or further away. And they had powers of investment. A well run bridge can cover its repair and maintenance costs and generate quite a surplus. Some of these foundations give out substantial charitable sums from their surplus. https://www.citybridgefoundation.org.uk/what-we-do/bridges https://rbt.org.uk re: the war on cash via German HINTERGRUND magazine The gradual abolition of cash The following text is an excerpt from the Spiegel bestseller “War on Cash” by Hakon von Holst.

The Chinese kindergarten video is AI. So is the narration. Watch and listen closely. That stuff is getting quite good. “Rolnded” on the girl’s shirt while the “narrator” is saying “….to tackle next”? Naw that’s fake. There has been videos showing this in Chinese kindergartens for years now which predate the introduction of AI. Which does not mean that this video is not made by AI trained on those older videos. :) Dang it moderation queue for now so I can’t edit but I might have been wrong. https://algrande.shop/products/rolnded-patchwork-shirt-collar-long-sleeve-button-up-top I am still trying to find any actual confirmation of such a school and it all leads back to that social media (TikTok, Insta, FB, YT vid) some with a different narration “voice”, all with the same script. Color me surprised and corrected if I was too skeptical. The article in the NYT on the ‘Democrat Autopsy’ mentions that “producing a tough-minded public review of a national electoral defeat would be a politically delicate exercise under any circumstance, given the need to find fault with the work and judgment of important party leaders and strategists.” The article then goes on to completely exclude any mention of the Gaza Genocide, which the NYT has invisibilized… imagine that!

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Dell employees are not OK. Every year, the company conducts an engagement survey for its workers, called "Tell Dell." One metric of employee satisfaction has dropped by 50% in two years amid layoffs and its push to get workers back in the office. On the agenda today: But first: Unpacking the new generational debate. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Millennials gave us skinny jeans and avocado toast. Gen Z? They've mastered the stare. Yes, that stare — the blank, expressionless look from the younger generation that's been lighting up the internet lately. Is it real? A post-pandemic side effect? A silent cry for help? Or is it just how Gen Z vibes? At Business Insider, we dove headfirst into the phenomenon, decoding the psychology, exploring what it means for careers, and examining how it plays out in the workplace. What is it? As more of Gen Z enters the workforce, some millennials say younger workers greet customers and colleagues with wide eyes, blank expressions, and pregnant pauses. Most of the debate hinges on Gen Zers working customer service roles, like hostessing at restaurants or taking orders at coffee shops. While this could be a sign of workplace awkwardness or underdeveloped soft skills, others are pushing back and saying the trend's blame is misplaced. Is it real? Our resident Gen Zer Amanda Yen says, "It's ironic that millennials are diagnosing their Gen Z counterparts in much the same way boomers diagnosed and pathologized them. Millennials, are you sure you're not just becoming your parents?" The value of silence. BI's Katie Notopoulos, an older millennial, said if you're on the receiving end of the "Gen-Z stare," maybe you're the problem. "One thing I learned is that sometimes silence is the best way to handle a situation. In other words, you might say: Give 'em the 'Gen Z stare.' If someone keeps pushing, eventually you have to leave some silence hanging in the air — no more room for them to negotiate." Just don't get Katie started on how Gen Zers answer the phone! Is screen time to blame? Psychologists and generational experts are weighing in, saying the phenomenon could have more to do with natural growing pains on a first job. There are also factors unique to Gen Z's upbringing, including how the generation has grown up in front of screens. One professor told BI that it's naive to underestimate the impact that COVID-19 shutdowns and online learning could have had on young people's development. What do Gen Zers think? We asked several young people between the ages of 17 and 27 what they thought about the debate. A 21-year-old from Boston thinks the whole thing is overblown. A 20-year-old from the Bay Area said she sees it all the time. A 17-year-old heard from her parents that she had been inadvertently doing it. We asked our readers if they had experienced the "Gen Z stare." The results are in, and spoiler — a majority of you have! It's been six months since Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency slashed the federal workforce in an effort to "streamline the Federal Government, eliminate unnecessary programs, and reduce bureaucratic inefficiency." After months of being in limbo, a recent Supreme Court ruling allowed the stalled firings to proceed. In a series of conversations with BI, six former government employees spoke about their career shifts, what life is like outside government work, and more. "I'll always be known as that." Also read: The ability to return a purchased item has become a core part of the shopping experience. Retailers say consumers are taking advantage of returns — and a recent report from Appriss Retail and Deloitte found it's costing businesses $103 billion a year. Some consumers are committing outright fraud by shipping back empty boxes or claiming a package never arrived. Others are sending back items after months of use. The culprits are often everyday consumers, and they don't feel bad. A nation of retail fraudsters. Also read: Elite millennials like Dan Schweber are quitting corporate America in favor of search funds: the practice of buying and running small businesses, also known as "mini private equity." Plenty of these unglamorous small businesses — like carwashes, plumbing, or snowplowing — are owned by boomers looking to retire. That makes them prime for millennial MBAs like Schweber, who can, in some cases, turn them into multimillion-dollar companies. Here's how they do it. You've probably heard of the viral concert "kiss cam" video that appeared to show Astronomer CEO Andy Byron embracing the company's head of HR Kristin Cabot, then springing apart once they realize they're on camera. The reaction prompted Coldplay's Chris Martin to comment, "Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy." A potential office affair is good gossip, but BI's Katie Notopoulos thinks there's something more troubling here: the knee-jerk reaction to identify the people in the video. Why she regrets seeing that video. This week's quote: "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder." — A millennial who was paid to catch people secretly working multiple jobs but ended up joining them.

Title: Starbucks corporate workers protest the latest RTO mandate: 'This is the wrong direction. Please stop.'

Employees at Starbucks' corporate headquarters who are unhappy about CEO Brian Niccol's strict return-to-office mandate are making their displeasure known. On Friday, a flyer created by "Partners for the Preservation of Starbucks Culture, Mission, and Values" was taped inside an elevator at the corporate offices in Seattle. Featuring two photos of Niccol and a list of grievances, the flyer calls out Niccol's leadership, recent cost-cutting bonuses for executives, the RTO order, and broader changes in the work environment, a photo shows. "Getting 'Back to Starbucks' isn't just about comfy chairs. It's about our Culture, Values, Mission, and how we treat people and the environment," it reads. "This is the wrong direction. Please stop." It appeared several days after Niccol sent a firm message to the company's corporate workers on Monday: Come back to the office four days a week or leave. Some "people leaders" who manage teams had their remote status eliminated, requiring them to relocate to Seattle or Toronto. According to internal communications viewed by Business Insider, Starbucks offered voluntary buyout packages of between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on title, for those who would rather leave the company. Four Starbucks corporate employees told BI they were worried the strict return-to-office mandate contributed to an erosion of the company's "partner first" culture. A Starbucks spokesperson told BI the return-to-office mandate was about enhancing the company's culture, not further reducing head count. Starbucks formally laid off 1,100 corporate workers in February. "I think for those of us who have been around for a while, we see a culture shift happening in the organization where our public face doesn't necessarily match our private face anymore," one Starbucks veteran, who has worked for the company for nearly 20 years, told BI. The latest RTO notices surprised the corporate Starbucks workers who spoke with BI and prompted others to immediately begin looking for new roles and sharing their concerns on social media. "As Starbucks chooses to require all people-leaders to relocate to Seattle, I am placed in a position where I must consider exploring other opportunities and would appreciate your support," Kristina Lawson, a Starbucks program manager who has been with the company for more than 18 years, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. Lawson didn't respond to a request for comment. Corporate America is in the middle of a return-to-office showdown. BI has reported that major companies, from Amazon to Zoom, have implemented various RTO mandates. Each company's approach has been different, with some incentivizing employees to work in-office with perks such as raises, and others threatening to fire workers if they don't comply. BI's Aki Ito reported in May that some suspected strict RTO mandates were actually a way to get employees to quit — and they may be right, because voluntary resignations remove the company's need to pay severance or health insurance, resulting in a less expensive reduction in force than traditional layoffs. "We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together," Niccol said in a statement to BI. "We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster." Niccol's statement continued: "We're driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values. We know we're asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone." Niccol, who joined the company from Chipotle last September, has been leading the coffee giant through a "Back to Starbucks" revitalization initiative. He's attempting to reverse slumping sales, improve the customer experience, and address problems with its mobile ordering system and long wait times. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Starbucks is offering top executives up to $6 million in stock bonuses if the company meets its cost-reduction goals by the end of fiscal 2027. One Starbucks employee in Seattle who has worked in corporate operations for the company for more than seven years told BI that several other anonymous flyers had been posted around the building with complaints about changes Niccol was promoting and that some employees had voiced concern in open Slack channels. While they won't be personally affected by the RTO order, the employee said they were worried about how the company would operate if some of the most passionate partners decide to leave. "There are some remote partners that have niche knowledge and skills that will leave massive Kool-Aid Man-sized holes in the wall if they decide to take the exit payment," the employee said.

Title: As Newsom Campaigns, California Has Highest Unemployment Rate in U.S.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has already started his 2028 presidential campaign — but his state has the highest unemployment rate in the United States. As Breitbart News reported earlier this month, Newsom left California in the midst of over a dozen wildfires to travel to rural South Carolina, testing the waters for a presidential run in the state Democrats have promoted to the first in the list of primary contests. However, while Newsom has led Democrats in criticizing President Donald Trump and other Republicans, his performance in office is a drag on his prospects. Last month, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation: California’s unemployment rate rose slightly, by 0.1 percentage point, to 5.4% in June, tying Nevada for the highest rate in the U.S., according to new federal data released Friday. The state lost a net 6,100 jobs, including 9,900 layoffs in business and professional services. Health care and government saw job gains, but other sectors all shrunk. … California’s May jobs gains were also revised downwards to a 11,700 increase, down 6,000 jobs compared to a preliminary estimate of 17,700. 5.4% is not historically high; it is below the 5.5% that economists once believed was the “Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment” (NAIRU), the lowest rate possible before inflation would begin to rise. Still, it points to the fact that the Golden State is underperforming relative to the rest of the country, which — even in deep-blue jurisdictions — has tended to avoid some of California’s more extreme left-wing policies.

Title: The Oligarchs' Coup Against the Free Press Is Happening Now

Time Published: 2025-07-20T05:47:01Z

The American information space is not merely changing; it is undergoing a hostile takeover. It is a deliberate, coordinated campaign by a new class of oligarchs out of Silicon Valley that includes Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg acting in concert with a Trump-led authoritarian political project. Their goal is singular: to systematically dismantle the free press and rebuild it as a network of propaganda organs designed to protect and uphold the regime and the oligarchs. The gutting of The Washington Post is not a separate event from the algorithmic manipulation of X. The defunding of PBS is not disconnected from the weaponization of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These are interconnected fronts in a single, undeclared war on the very concept of an informed public. To understand the nature of this war you must turn to Hannah Arendt and her concept of “a fool’s freedom.”[1] The modern deprivation of rights comes not from the overt censorship of opinion, but from the construction of an ecosystem where that opinion is rendered impotent. It is the freedom to speak into the abyss. What good is the right to an opinion if that opinion can never gain traction, never reach a critical mass, and therefore never matter? The oligarchs’ total control over the means of distribution (the algorithms of Google, Tiktok, Meta, and X) is the silent, brutally effective mechanism for enforcing this new, more insidious form of authoritarianism. The first front in this war is the capture and neutering of the legacy press from within. The billionaire owners of media, acting more as a political ideologue than a business custodian, have seized direct control of the nation’s most storied newsrooms. The narrative of financial necessity has become the perfect camouflage for an ideological purge. The language of “reinvention” and “transformation” is a smokescreen, obscuring a systematic effort to install loyalists, enforce regime-friendly editorial lines, and drive out any journalist who dares to uphold the quaint notion of holding power to account. This is a coordinated purge executed by a new class of authoritarian oligarchs who see a free press not as a pillar of democracy, but as an obstacle to their regime. The Press Has Been Systematically Dismantled by the Highest Bidder The Washington Post’s famous slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” now reads like a grim epitaph carved on its own tombstone. Democracy died and Jeff Bezos helped take it out back to shoot it and bury it for good measure. When Jeff Bezos bought the paper, many in the media hoped for a savior. Instead, it got an executioner and undertaker. The veneer of benevolent, hands-off ownership fell away as the prospect of a second Trump administration loomed, and the Amazon kingpin began his work: systematically gutting the institution and bending it to his will. The purge that followed was brutal. Under the watch of CEO Will Lewis, a political hatchet man brought over from the Murdoch empire, a wave of talent was driven out. Veterans with decades of experience were shown the door. A Pulitzer-winning cartoonist was silenced for satirizing the new power structure. Those who weren't fired were encouraged to take buyouts, fleeing a newsroom consumed by a crisis of purpose. What remains is a hollowed-out shell, a once-great institution forced into dutiful submission. On the West Coast, the same playbook is running its course at the Los Angeles Times. Billionaire owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has presided over a slow-motion demolition, using the cudgel of financial crisis to carry out a political hit. Under the cover of staggering financial losses that have only mounted under his ownership, Soon-Shiong has unleashed a relentless series of layoffs, gutting over 20% of the newsroom and leaving it, in the words of its own union, “a shadow of its former self.”[2] But the carnage isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about silencing a powerful, critical voice. Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong personally intervened to kill a presidential endorsement that would have angered Trump. He has since been explicit about his goal of imposing a “more balanced ideological approach,” and to do so, he has brought in Republican operatives, including the former head of a pro-Trump PAC, to help reshape the paper’s editorial board. The strategy is clear: starve the newsroom, then restaff it with loyalists. The capture of individual newspapers is only phase one. The next is to weaken any remaining progressive outposts, leaving them vulnerable. MSNBC, long a bastion of liberal politics under its headline star, Rachel Maddow, is being led to the slaughter. Parent company Comcast is spinning the network off, severing it from the newsroom of NBC News and the broader protection of NBCUniversal. This isn't a business decision; it’s an abandonment. MSNBC is being left on the side of the road, an isolated and weakened target ripe for a takeover. The "jokes" by Elon Musk about buying the network and firing its stars are not jokes at all. They are the vultures circling, a public declaration of intent from the oligarch class. And their ambition doesn’t stop at the news. It extends to the very fabric of culture. The persistent rumors that Jeff Bezos plans to acquire Condé Nast (Vogue, Wired, The New Yorker, and Vanity Fair) as a wedding gift for his wife, Lauren Sanchez, reveals the endgame.[3] This is the terminal stage of oligarchic conquest where the power to shape global culture is reduced to a personal trinket. It is the ultimate expression of contempt for the public sphere, a world where the means of mass communication become just another luxury good, molded to the whims of our new feudal lords. The Algorithmic Coup: Seizing the Means of Reality Production While the oligarchs have been conducting a hostile takeover of legacy media, they have also been slowly amping up their control of the algorithms that curate reality itself to the vast majority of the population. It’s a hostile takeover of the digital public square by a handful of oligarchs acting in service to an authoritarian regime. The "For You" page and the News Feed have been weaponized, turned from sorting tools into active instruments of political power, used to manufacture consent and crush dissent on a scale that makes old-world propaganda look primitive. Elon Musk’s seizure of Twitter and its rebranding as X is the playbook’s most brazen chapter. Under the fraudulent banner of “free speech absolutism,” he gutted the platform and began the real work: transforming a global communication tool into his personal propaganda megaphone. His philosophy of “Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom of Reach” was a lie from the start, a pretext for a system where his allies are amplified and his critics are shadow banned into oblivion. After his endorsement of Donald Trump, the political agenda became undeniable. Researchers identified a "structural break" in the algorithm, a point where the code was rewritten to systematically favor Republican accounts.[4] The system is now so blatantly biased that it has triggered investigations by the European Commission. The final piece of this ideological propaganda project is Grok, his AI chatbot that called itself “MechaHitler” just last week is being aligned to avoid being "woke," creating a model that reflects his own paranoid worldview back at him.[5] While Musk’s takeover was a frontal assault, Mark Zuckerberg’s at Meta is a strategic surrender. Facing the threat of a vengeful Trump administration, Zuckerberg has preemptively neutered his platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads to appease the ascendant right. This is not principle; it is appeasement from a man who was seemingly birthed without a spine or personality of his own. In a sweeping act of capitulation dressed in gaudy chains and baggy t-shirts, Zuckerberg dismantled Meta's third-party fact-checking program, a system long despised by conservatives, and replacing it with a manipulated "Community Notes" model imported from Musk's X. He has opened the floodgates for inflammatory rhetoric on immigration and gender, especially transgender people, ensuring the regime's talking points will flow freely. Zuckerberg has seen which way the wind is blowing and is ensuring his platforms will serve as a hospitable environment for the new power. The final and biggest prize in this digital war is TikTok, the dominant cultural artery for an entire generation. The forced sale of the platform from its Chinese parent company, justified under the pretext of "national security," is a blatant lie. The true objective is not to protect American data, which could be done by passing meaningful data protections, but rather, to seize control of the world's most powerful algorithm for influencing youth culture.[6] The leading proposed buyer is a consortium led by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, one of Donald Trump's most powerful and loyal allies in Silicon Valley and whose son, David Ellison, is currently finalizing his own takeover of Paramount and plans on repurposing CBS News into a propaganda organ by placing Bari Weiss in charge.[7] Placing TikTok in the hands of a regime loyalist is the strategic masterstroke. It would give them direct control over the primary information channel for a generation that has been historically resistant to their message. It is the power to decide what trends, what is cool, and what is thinkable. The forced sale of TikTok is nothing less than a state-orchestrated hostile takeover of the youth's collective consciousness. The State’s Assault on Truth The oligarchs' private capture of the media is but one arm of a pincer movement. The other is a direct, state led assault by the Trump administration and its allies on any remaining sources of independent information. This demonstrates a core tenet of modern authoritarianism: there is no distinction between the state and the party. All levers of government, from regulatory agencies to the justice system and the federal budget are seen not as instruments of public service, but rather as legitimate weapons to be used to reward allies and punish enemies. From this perspective, these actions are not an abuse of the system; they are the system's intended purpose. The campaign to destroy public broadcasting in America is a long-term, strategic priority for the Trump movement, laid bare in the pages of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's comprehensive playbook for a second Trump term. The plan is not merely to reform public media but to annihilate it. Project 2025 explicitly calls for the complete defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides essential funding for NPR and PBS stations across the country. The blueprint goes further, advocating for stripping these outlets of their non-commercial educational status and even moving them off their desirable FM radio frequencies to make way for religious and Christian nationalist broadcasting. The justification is that public media is a "liberal disinformation machine" that must be dismantled.[8] The rescission package expected to pass Congress this week will zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and claw back $1.1 billion in funding already allocated to the CPB.[9] This effort to starve public media would be devastating, particularly for rural and underserved communities that rely on these stations as their primary source of local news and emergency information, effectively creating vast "news deserts" across the country. That’s entirely the point. They need to ensure that those living in rural areas become hopelessly dependent on propaganda in order to access even basic information about the world around them. The final weapon in the state's arsenal is the legal and regulatory system itself, which is being wielded to intimidate, extort, and co-opt media organizations into submission. The Trump administration is increasingly using every aspect of government to intimidate and coerce media organizations into yielding to its narrative. The most chilling precedent is the $16 million settlement paid by Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, to end a frivolous lawsuit brought by Donald Trump.[10] Paramount has an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media pending before the Trump-controlled FCC. The FCC Chairman, Brendan Carr, had already reopened a dubious "news distortion" investigation into the very same interview, placing the merger in jeopardy. Facing this immense pressure, Paramount capitulated. This case is part of a broader pattern of using various federal agencies as a sword of Damocles. Trump and his appointees have repeatedly threatened to use the power of the FCC and FTC to punish their perceived enemies. This includes threats to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like NBC and ABC for "Country Threatening Treason," launching politically motivated investigations into news outlets, and promising to bring these supposedly independent agencies under direct presidential authority. This strategy of direct state coercion creates a pervasive climate of fear, encouraging self-censorship and ensuring that media owners think twice before publishing anything that might anger the regime. The Fool's Freedom The sum total of these actions by the oligarchs to capture legacy media, manipulate the algorithmic control of digital platforms, and use the state to assault any remaining independent voices has created a terrifyingly effective new model of information control. It is a system that maintains the outward appearance of a free and diverse media landscape. We still have websites to browse, podcasts to download, and newsletters to subscribe to. Many will even be harshly critical of the oligarchs and the Trump administration. We still possess, in the narrowest legal sense, the right to an opinion. But this is a fool’s freedom. As Hannah Arendt noted, the most profound deprivation of rights occurs not when you are forbidden to have an opinion, but when your opinion is rendered meaningless. The oligarchs’ control over the critical infrastructure of information distribution is the ultimate choke point. They are the gatekeepers of relevance, the silent arbiters of what is seen and what is buried, what is amplified and what is ignored. This new reality destroys the very possibility of public accountability. An independent journalist can break a world-changing story, a citizen can voice powerful dissent, but if these are algorithmically suppressed, they cannot reach a critical mass. They cannot generate public outrage. They cannot hold power to account. This is speech without consequence, opinion without impact. Arendt’s concept of “action,” meaning the speech and deeds through which we appear to one another and create a shared public world, is rendered impossible. We are witnessing the construction of a sophisticated, 21st-century propaganda state. It is a state that doesn’t need to burn books when it can simply change the algorithm. It maintains the illusion of choice while ensuring, through a seamless integration of private ownership, state intimidation, and algorithmic control, that only one narrative prevails. The choice we are left with is not between different news sources, but between different flavors of state and oligarch approved information. This is the grim reality of the fool’s freedom in which we now live. Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (Expanded edition. ed. 2025) at p. 315. (“The same is true even to an ironical extent with regard to the right of freedom which is sometimes considered to be the very essence of human rights. There is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have more freedom of movement than a lawfully imprisoned criminal or that they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a totalitarian country. But neither physical safety—being fed by some state or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives is due to charity and not to right, for no law exists which could force the nations to feed them; their freedom of movement, if they have it at all, gives them no right to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys as a matter of course; and their freedom of opinion is a fool’s freedom, for nothing they think matters anyhow. These last points are crucial. The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of choice, or when one is placed in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not of the right to think whatever they please, but of the right to opinion.”) ↩︎ Farley Elliott, ‘Devastated’: New Layoffs Hit California’s Biggest Newspaper, SFGATE (May 2, 2025), https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/la-times-layoffs-latest-20307200.php. ↩︎ Jeff Bezos Rumored To Buy Vogue as Wedding Gift to Lauren Sanchez, ‘Source’ Claims, Yahoo Entertainment (Jul. 7, 2025), https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/jeff-bezos-rumored-buy-vogue-120000915.html. ↩︎ Wes Davis, A Study Found That X’s Algorithm Now Loves Two Things: Republicans and Elon Musk, The Verge (Nov. 17, 2024), https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change. ↩︎ Alejandra Caraballo, The Algorithmic Unmasking: How Grok’s “MechaHitler” Turn Revealed the Inevitable Collapse of “Anti-Woke” AI, The Dissident (Jul. 9, 2025), https://www.thedissident.news/the-algorithmic-unmasking-how-groks-mechahitler-turn-revealed-the-inevitable-collapse-of-anti-woke-ai/. ↩︎ Mike Masnick, Once More With Feeling: Banning TikTok Is Unconstitutional & Won’t Do Shit To Deal With Any Actual Threats, Techdirt (Mar. 14, 2024), https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/14/once-more-with-feeling-banning-tiktok-is-unconstitutional-wont-do-shit-to-deal-with-any-actual-threats/. ↩︎ Brian Stelter, CBS’ Likely New Owner Is in Talks with Bari Weiss to Buy The Free Press | CNN Business, CNN (Jul. 11, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/media/free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-paramount. ↩︎ Project 2025: What a Second Trump Term Could Mean for Media and Technology Policies, Brookings, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/project-2025-what-a-second-trump-term-could-mean-for-media-and-technology-policies/ (last visited Jul. 17, 2025). ↩︎ Scott Neuman, Senate Approves Cuts to NPR, PBS and Foreign Aid Programs, NPR, Jul. 17, 2025, https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5469904/npr-pbs-cuts-rescission-senate-vote. ↩︎ Benjamin Mullin Michael M.

Title: Trump considers changes to H-1B visa program

By WND Staff July 19, 2025 The often-controversial H-1B visa foreign-worker program may be getting updated under President Trump’s Homeland Security Department. The program was meant to provide American firms more options to hire qualified workers, including those from foreign countries. However, as WND has covered extensively, the H-1B system has been used countless times to replace Americans with less expensive immigrants. For example, while U.S.-based Microsoft workers have faced multiple waves of layoffs, including a recent round targeting the Xbox division, the company has already cut more than 10,000 employees across various divisions, including 6,000 in May alone, and hundreds more in June. Between May and June, Microsoft laid off 2,300 employees in Washington alone, including 817 software engineers, according to official WARN Act filings. But during the same period, Microsoft submitted 6,327 H-1B visa requests for software engineer roles matching the same job titles and location as those affected by the layoffs. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! As reported at the National Pulse, Thursday DHS filed a notice of a possible change in H-1B requirements with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to the report, the proposal includes a “weighted selection process” for applicants under the capped portion of the program. The filing, however, provides no further details as to how the new system would function. The statutory cap for H-1B visas is set at 85,000 per year. During the 2024 presidential campaign, prominent supporters of Donald Trump publicly disagreed about the value of the H-1B program, with both Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy expressing support. Opinion polls on the program, however, have shown that a majority of Americans disapprove of the visa program. Trump had previously argued that H-1B visas are “unfair” to American workers, saying in 2016, “I know the H-1B very well. And it’s something that I frankly use, and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it.” As the National Pulse points out, critics of the program argue that the current lottery system disproportionately benefits larger companies such as Amazon, Meta and Microsoft, and leaves American workers at a disadvantage, having to compete with cheap foreign labor. A weighted system could potentially replace the random lottery system as a means to prioritize better qualified visa applicants.

“Ek crore ho gaya toh life set hai” -- This sentence has echoed across drawing rooms, chai stalls, the LIC agent brochures for decades and not to mention Amitabh Bachchan’s deep voice emphasising the importance of “ek crore” in Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) in early 2000s. It was the ultimate middle-class milestone — the surefire way of making it big in life. But in 2025, that one-crore dream does not hold much water? It’s more of a mirage than a milestone. Because by the time you say “I’ve made it”, inflation, EMIs, and real-life curveballs have already gatecrashed the party. Let’s unmask the myth that ₹1 crore is enough and see why financial “settling down” has become a moving goalpost. 1. Inflation is eating your money faster than you think: In the early 2000s, ₹1 crore could buy you a house, a car, and still leave enough for FD interest to run your household. But not today. In a city like Bangalore or Mumbai, this won’t even get you a decent 2BHK house. Add to that 4-6% inflation, and your one crore will feel like ₹30–40 lakh in no time. Reality: The same ₹30 dosa is now ₹120, and that’s just breakfast. 2. One medical emergency can wipe out your savings: Middle-class families are just one health scare away from financial turmoil. A decent cancer treatment, bypass surgery, or organ transplant costs ₹15–30 lakh. If your health cover is the standard ₹5 lakh from years ago, your savings become collateral damage. One ICU bill = Goodbye one crore. 3. Lifestyle inflation is real: Your lifestyle has levelled up, but have your savings kept pace? From iPhones to impulse Zomato orders, your crore can vanish without warning. 4. Job security is an illusion: And sadly, no private sector job is permanent anymore, not even in MNCs, IT, or startups. One recession, one restructuring, or one AI tool and boom – layoffs, pay cuts, or upskilling pressure. Ask any techie in their 40s — they’ve seen the axe fall. So if your plan was: “Retire early, start a homestay in Goa” with that crore, it is better to rework the spreadsheet. 5. Children’s education costs a fortune: Think ₹1 crore will help you chill post-retirement? Think again. A decent Indian private university will cost you ₹30–40 lakh. Foreign education? ₹1–1.5 crore easily. And this doesn’t even include coaching fees, laptops, or hostel charges. So basically: one child = one crore. Why do we still worship this ₹1 crore figure? Because it feels big. It’s a round, shiny number. But feelings don’t beat facts. And in today’s India, facts are brutal. Financial stability is no longer a destination. It’s a continuous journey and ₹1 crore is just the petrol pump, not the finish line. Multiple income sources: Don’t just rely on one job. Freelance, invest, rent out property — hustle smart, not just hard. Large emergency reserve: It is recommended to keep 6 to 12 months of expenses ready. One job loss shouldn’t lead to moving into your parents’ house. Health and life insurance: Get real coverage ₹25–50 lakh minimum for health. And no, your office insurance doesn’t count when you’re between the jobs. Smart investing: FDs won’t save you. SIPs in mutual funds, index funds, NPS — that’s where your money should be working overtime. Financial literacy: You don’t need a full-fledged chartered accountancy qualification but you definitely must understand inflation, taxation, and compounding. Your financial future relies on it. Most middle-class Indians aren’t financially stable, they’re just financially suspended. One layoff, one surgery, one market crash and the whole “life set hai" illusion collapses like a pack of cards. Ask yourself:If your income had stopped today, for how long would you live your current lifestyle?If your answer is less than 10–12 years — you’re not “settled.” You’re playing financial Jenga, hoping the next brick doesn’t topple everything. “Life is stable only when money works for you in your sleep and your survival doesn’t depend on active income.” So, the ₹one crore dream isn’t dead, it just needs an upgrade – perhaps to a bigger number. Add hustle, protection, awareness, and growth to it and then you’re getting close to “settled.” Catch all the Instant Personal Loan, Business Loan, Business News, Money news, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
