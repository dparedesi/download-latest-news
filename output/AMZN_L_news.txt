Amazon’s decision to shut down seven distribution centres in Quebec, affecting over 1,900 jobs, has sparked sharp criticism from Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne. In a strongly worded letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Champagne expressed disappointment over the closures and urged the company to reconsider, shared the minister on Thursday evening on X. “When Amazon entered the Canadian market, it did so recognizing the value of Canada’s exceptional workers,” Champagne wrote. He pointed out the closures undermine Amazon’s commitment to being “Earth’s best employer” and called the decision inconsistent with the company’s values. The closures come after Amazon’s Laval distribution centre became the first in North America to unionize, raising speculation that decision could be linked to its resistance to unionized labour. Champagne argued that Amazon’s Quebec facilities play a vital role in the company’s supply chain, ensuring quick delivery across the province and contributing significantly to the local economy. He added that the layoffs would have ripple effects on communities, highlighting the importance of Amazon’s business partnership with Canada. “It is not too late to reconsider your decision,” Champagne urged, adding that such layoffs raise concerns about Amazon’s long-term commitment to the Canadian market. The letter called for a review of Amazon’s relationship with the Canadian government and extended an invitation to discuss the matter further. With Parliament currently prorogued by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a spring federal election looming, Champagne’s words don’t mean much. But at least it makes his constituents feel better. In an emailed statement to iPhone in Canada on Wednesday, Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said, “Following a recent review of our Quebec operations, we’ve seen that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to what we had until 2020, will allow us to provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run.” She added, “This decision wasn’t made lightly, and we’re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks’ pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources.” In a nutshell, Laval workers unionized and Amazon appealed to the labour board, citing the vote didn’t recognize worker rights, since the vote was not by secret ballot, but rather by signing cards. Amazon lost the appeal–and now they have pulled out of Quebec.

Title: Washington Post editor says newspaper ‘utterly lost its soul’ after ‘equating’ Biden, Trump pardons

Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:43:14Z
Full Content:
A longtime associate editor at the Washington Post criticized his own newspaper for an editorial that blasted both President Trump and his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for having “both abused their pardon powers” and “setting dangerous precedents.” David Maraniss, who has spent nearly five decades at the Washington Post, took to social media on Wednesday and bemoaned the fact that his employer “has utterly lost its soul.” “The Washington Post editorial this morning essentially equating Biden’s questionable pardons with Trump’s outrageous Jan. 6 pardons was unconscionable,” Maraniss wrote on the Bluesky microblogging platform on Wednesday. “The newspaper I’ve been part of for 48 years has utterly lost its soul.” Maraniss, who has written biographies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, referred to an editorial titled: “Pardons from Biden and Trump flout the rule of law.” “President Joe Biden started the trouble by issuing preemptive pardons for five family members as well as former members of his administration,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote. “His rash action opens the door for future presidents to likewise immunize their families and staffs from merely theoretical prosecution by their successors — as though future presidents should be considered enemies whose actions must be defended against.” In the next paragraph, the editorial calls out Trump for pardoning those convicted for their roles in the rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “His reckless handout risks emboldening militias and others to commit future acts of barbarity in support of political aims. When such violence is tolerated, it happens more often,” the editorial read. The New York Post has sought comment from the Washington Post. Maraniss on Thursday told Status newsletter that it “disheartens” him “to see what is happening in this era of leadership” — a reference to owner Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the Amazon founder, has so far ignored a request from more than 400 of the newspaper’s staffers to visit the newsroom in the wake of an exodus of talent sparked by the decision to spike an endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris. A large chunk of the newspaper’s left-leaning readership was so outraged by the move that a reported 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships. “People are in utter despair,” a Washington Post staffer told Status. The newsletter said Washington Post employees found it “confounding … as to why Bezos insists on maintaining ownership of the newspaper.” “While he once seemed to take pride in owning it, and perhaps even enjoyed that the outlet served as a bulwark against Trump in his first term, that no longer seems to be the case,” Oliver Darcy wrote in Status. The Post has sought comment from Bezos. In recent weeks, the Washington Post has parted ways with several high-profile reporters and editors who have decamped for other media outlets. Philip Rucker, the highly regarded national editor, left for CNN, while longtime opinion columnist and Trump-basher Jennifer Rubin resigned to join Substack. Ann Telnaes, the newspaper’s cartoonist, resigned after the publication refused to print her cartoon mocking Bezos and other tech moguls as being too subservient to Trump. Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, two national political reporters, left for The Atlantic while investigative political reporter Josh Dawsey quit to join the Wall Street Journal. Morale at the Washington Post has been further damaged by recent layoffs of staffers on the business side. Management at the newspaper has also laid down the law and told staffers that they are welcome to submit their resignation if they refuse to return to the office five days per week. Advertisement

Saturday, 25 Jan 2025 OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is threatening to review its commercial relationship with Amazon after the online retail giant decided to close all its distribution centers in Quebec, local media reported Friday. Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne, expressing his strong disappointment, demanded that Amazon "immediately" reconsider the decision, according to the report. Amazon said that it would cease operations in the French-speaking province over the next two months, turning back to the third-party model it had until 2020 for package deliveries. As such, at least 1,700 regular employees in Quebec and 250 temporary-seasonal workers would lose their jobs, said the report. "This is not the way business is done in Canada," said Champagne on his social media account, stating that the "large and sudden layoffs are cause for concern." Amazon denied that the decision was made following the unionization of 200 employees last spring at one of the warehouses, according to the report. Thank you for your report!

Title: Stripe ruffles feathers as accidental ‘cartoon duck’ sent to laid-off staffers

An image accidentally sent to laid-off Stripe staffers shows their communications team might have just been winging it. The payment processing platform accidentally sent an image of a cartoon duck in emails to employees notifying them of their termination, The Post has learned. On Monday, Stripe – whose customers include Amazon, Alaska Airlines, Blockchain.com and Slack – announced it was laying off 300 employees, or approximately 3.5% of its workforce. The impacted staffers are mostly in product, engineering and operations roles, according to a leaked memo. These workers received emails with an attached image labeled “US-Non-California Duck” showing a fluffy yellow cartoon bird. Employees took to Blind, an anonymous site where corporate employees can share grievances, to make light of the duck-up. “Never liked it when someone put a duck on my Jeep…this would have sent me over the edge,” one Blind user registered as a Stripe employee wrote. A Stripe spokesperson confirmed that the duck images were accidentally sent to laid-off staffers, and that impacted employees received notices with the incorrect termination dates, as well. Business Insider earlier reported news of the leaked emails. “I apologize for the error and any confusion it caused,” Rob McIntosh, Stripe’s chief people officer, said in an email to employees. “Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes.” In a separate email, McIntosh told Stripe staffers that the company is still hoping to grow its workforce by 17% to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The tech startup, which launched in 2011, has suffered layoffs in the past. Stripe is a privately-held company, so most of its financials are not disclosed, but it was likely hit hard in 2022, when it laid off more than 1,000 staffers. At the time, CEO Patrick Collison blamed the economy and fears of a recession in a public letter – an explanation that won praise for its frankness. Stripe also cut its valuation multiple times over the years, though it recently jumped back up to around $70 billion in November, according to Bloomberg. The valuation puts Stripe in the same ranks as wealthy startups like SpaceX and OpenAI, though it’s still below its 2021 peak of $95 billion. Stripe is the second-largest startup in the Bay Area, behind only OpenAI, according to SFGate. Advertisement

Title: Trump has a message to CEOs: Build in America or pay up

President Donald Trump is making sure the whole world knows it: "America is back and open for business." Trump appeared via videolink to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he addressed some of the world's most powerful leaders. BI's Spriha Srivastava was in the room to witness the audience go from laughter to silence in seconds. "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America," Trump said. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff," he added. Trump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he said could begin as early as February 1. He also proposed a 60% tariff on China during his presidential campaign, but he said earlier this week he was considering a 10% tariff on goods from the country next month. When Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman asked about Europe, Trump didn't hold back, voicing his frustration with European regulatory enforcement actions against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta (who were major donors to his inauguration and whose CEOs were prominent guests). "Whether you like them or not, they're American companies, and they shouldn't be doing that," Trump said. Trump has plans for the corporate tax rate. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders. Trump said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US. The president also called out big banks, accusing them of discriminating against conservatives. "Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America," he said. Bank of America responded publicly, saying it welcomes conservatives among its 70 million clients. The president also thanked Saudi Arabia after it announced it would invest $600 billion in the US, but Trump added that he would be asking the crown prince "who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion." When Trump finished, Schwarzman remarked: "I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today." Trump's speech reminded Spriha of how different his style is from the measured, diplomatic tone that usually defines Davos. Whether his message landed the way he intended, however, is another question. BI's Katie Balevic, Dominick Reuter, Noah Sheidlower, and Allie Kelly have the full rundown of Trump's address.

Title: Want a Job In AI & Healthcare Tech? Here Are 5 Growth Areas Actively Hiring Right Now

There is significant demand for individuals interested in artificial intelligence and digital ... [+] transformation. There are widely mixed opinions on the state of the current job market. Most industry leaders signal that economic conditions seem to be healthy and the state of the market is incredibly robust. In fact, the latest report indicates that the U.S. economy added nearly 256,000 positions in December. However, many individuals are equally frustrated with the lack of opportunities and are experiencing a relatively stagnant labor market, especially with the numerous layoffs that have occurred in the last year. Some sectors have been more proactive than others, especially with regards to investing heavily in the new wave of AI innovation and digital transformation, which has resulted in increased demand for talent and skilled workers. Healthcare is one such field and has especially embraced AI as a means to reduce administrative burdens and improve workflows in the field. Indeed, 2025 will be a monumental year for this work. Individuals that are interested in healthcare technology and AI may have opportunities in the following 5 growth areas that are actively ramping up spending and hiring: 1. Work surrounding AI agents: 2025 is purported to be the year of AI agents in healthcare, which may be used for a variety of roles including responding to customer service inquiries, assisting with routine paperwork or even streamlining common and protocolized tasks. In fact, founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang mentioned at the CES conference earlier this month that IT departments will soon “become the HR of AI agents,” given how widespread and prevalent they will become. 2. Cloud engineering and architecture: many of the largest AI platforms including those by Google, Amazon and Microsoft are hosted and provided through their respective cloud services. For example, Google’s Vertex AI Search is a widely successful product which streamlines search within healthcare organizations and enables rapid insight generation for providers. Healthcare organizations can access this platform through Google Cloud. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer similar services. Thus, cloud applications have become incredibly critical in the AI arena and will undoubtedly require a lot of talent. 3. Digital twins technology: this is another growing area which enables organizations to create virtual models to run simulations and alter paradigms to better inform decision-making. Digital twin platforms can entail technical models such as a human heart model or a protein molecule to aid in drug development, or larger datasets across an entire population or community to inform macroscopic decisions. Digital twins have immense potential in healthcare as the technology can be used to resolve critical situations with high fidelity representations. Dr. Natalia Trayanova leads some of this work at Johns Hopkins University and uses the technology to support personalized healthcare in the field of cardiology: “digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment.” 4. Health devices: this area is projected to have a blockbuster decade as there has been an increased focus by the general population on collecting more health metrics and insights. For example, Google’s FitBit is one of the most popular devices in the world of personalized hardware and provides users with information on their daily energy expenditure and fitness goals. Another great example is the Oura ring, which has been incredibly popular in the last few years as a sleep tracking device; the company just recently hit $5 billion in valuation. There is a huge demand for both software experts and hardware engineers in this line of work. 5. Technology strategy: these roles will be a key aspect of healthcare organization portfolios in the coming years. Despite all the technical work, organizations must ultimately devise a strategy and justify their investments in artificial intelligence and digital health. This is where senior strategists and those familiar with enterprise optimization can come in handy, especially as many organizations are struggling to still define and realize the true ROI for healthcare AI applications. These leaders will be paramount to understand the technology landscape, develop accurate forecasts and determine the future course for organizations. Undoubtedly, those interested in technology will have to remain nimble and willing to up-skill themselves accordingly. Despite a rapidly changing job landscape, the swift growth of technology and AI, especially as they pertain to healthcare, offer numerous potential opportunities for determined job seekers to take advantage of.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Africa content team has reshuffled with ex-Amazon exec Kaye-Ann Williams brought in to oversee TV and movies as Tendeka Matatu exits. Williams takes on the newly-created Director of Scripted Content role and will focus on local productions, overseeing a team that develops and creates African original films and series. She joins after a short stint as content boss at The Traitors South Africa producer Primedia Studios and is a former Head of Scripted Series and Movies at Prime Video/Amazon Studios, where she focused on South Africa. Commencing her role next month, Williams will report to Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s Vice President of Middle East & Africa Content. Watch on Deadline Related Stories Cancellations and Renewals 'Selling The OC' Renewed For Season 4 At Netflix News Tim McGraw Exits Netflix's Bull Riding Drama Series Due To Surgery Williams will join shortly after the exit of Matatu, who was Director of Local Language Films, Africa, for the past three years. No word on Matatu’s next move but we are told he is pursuing other opportunities. His credits included Heart of the Hunter and Kandasamys: The Baby. Amadasun credited Williams with helping creative talent “create some of the most ambitious projects on African television.” “I’m delighted to welcome Kaye-Ann to the team as we strengthen our long-term commitment to African storytelling,” he added. “I look forward to working alongside her to further build on the wonderful work the team has done so far to deliver compelling stories from Africa and to nurture our many local creative partnerships.” Amazon cut funding in Africa and made layoffs last year and sources from the local sector had recently questioned whether Netflix was heading in the same direction, with rumors of shows being pulled. Netflix pushed back, noting that it is “strengthening its investment in African storytelling” and pointing to Williams’ stellar credentials. Since kickstarting local African commissioning with 2020’s Queen Sono, Netflix cited significant deals struck with the likes of Silverton Siege’s Mandla Dube and Jayan Moodley, creator of the Kandasamys franchise. At the recent MIP Africa in Cape Town, Amadasun unveiled a trio of new movies along with a Blood Legacy series from Blood & Water producer Gambit Films and reality show Love Never Lies: South Africa. The news comes off the back of a strong week for Netflix. The streaming powerhouse smashed estimates by adding nearly 19 million subscribers in Q4 – the final quarter for which it will report these numbers.

Title: ‘We are treated like ‘boat people:’ Indian techies alarmed by Trump’s bros
URL: https://www.rt.com/india/611509-indians-us-h1b-uncertainty-trump/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T09:05:09Z

On a pleasant January morning in Bengaluru, known globally as the Silicon Valley of India, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti opened a new consulate, the fifth in the South Asian nation. In three days, the Joe Biden appointee would step down, paving the way for the Trump 2.0 administration to choose his replacement. Speaking at the event, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called it a “new milestone” in bilateral relations, particularly in sectors like technology, space, defense, and education. “As we enter an era of AI, EVs, drones, biotechnology, and advanced space exploration, our partnership will increasingly be defined by innovation. Bengaluru, as India’s tech capital, and [the state of] Karnataka, as a hub of innovation, will play crucial roles in this journey,” Jaishankar said. Three days later, on January 20, he would be attending the swearing-in ceremony of US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. Later, he would engage the newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the issue of “irregular immigration” and visa policy regarding the millions of Indian professionals in the US. On that January day, around 8,000 miles away, in a Boston suburb, N. Ranganathan, a 36-year-old software techie working as a software analyst, was visibly upset with a leading aircraft manufacturer. He, his wife and their three-year-old son were in for a hard realization about the US being “a land of dreams.” “I have been in this country for the last seven years and with my son having been born here, I was hoping that my son gets naturalized citizenship. With the latest ruling by the president, I am not sure whether I and my family want to be [here], as we feel disrespected about the fact that despite paying taxes as well as contributing to the US economy, we are treated like ‘boat people’ (refugees).” Like Ranganathan, millions of Indians face the dilemma of whether to continue working in the US or seek alternative options. US President Donald Trump began his term in office with sweeping executive orders, including one ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are neither American citizens nor permanent residents. This could affect over a million Indians waiting for green cards – with some of them locked in a bureaucratic backlog for a decade. However, broader concern over Trump’s visa policies during his second term is something that is being discussed both among the diaspora in the US and back in Bengaluru and other Indian tech hubs. India’s $250 billion IT outsourcing industry is at a critical juncture – and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the biggest challenge. In December, social media was boiling after billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Their statements sparked an online spat between anti-immigration Trump loyalists and the tech-oriented conservative faction. The US tech industry, which is facing layoffs, relies on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of IT professionals – mainly from India (over 72%), as well as China and other nations. Supporters claim that H-1B workers address essential skill shortages and foster innovation, while opponents argue that the program keeps wages low and displaces US employees. Musk, who himself is a South African immigrant who once held an H-1B visa, said he was in favor of bringing “the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” via a legal route as it is “essential for America to keep winning.” He also told critics to “go f*** yourself in the face,” referring to them as “subtards.” Musk has long argued for increased immigration and greater opportunities for skilled workers to live and work in the US, often pointing out that the country’s long-term success depends on attracting the best and brightest talent globally. The online standoff came days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule aimed at ‘reforming’ the H-1B program to help American companies address critical workforce shortages. The new rule looks to simplify the approval process, enhancing flexibility for employers to retain skilled workers, and strengthen the program’s oversight and integrity. Additionally, on December 27th, the US Department of State announced the completion of a successful pilot program to let people renew H-1B visas without having to leave the country. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, the Department of State said, promising to establish a US-based renewal program in 2025. At around the same time, President Trump announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born venture capitalist, to lead artificial intelligence policy. In the past, Krishnan had supported the removal of country caps on green cards for skilled immigrants in the US. This was too much for some MAGA supporters, who feel that this visa system needs to be scrapped as it doesn’t add any value to the US economy and instead takes away the jobs of people who have similar qualifications. In some cases, American workers who were laid off were forced to train their H-1B counterparts. If they failed to do so, they risked losing their severance pay. Federal lawsuits were filed by two of the tech workers laid off from the Walt Disney Co. One of them even testified before a Senate Committee. The war of words on H-1B was not limited to social media. There have been racist attacks against Indians on the TV and in real life. Fox News carried an interview with a commentator who openly referred to Indians as “third world parasites.” Immediately after the online fracas between Musk and other MAGA supporters, Trump came to Elon’s defense. In an interview with the New York Post, he praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the US. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. Speaking at a press conference at the White House after taking office, Trump said “I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do,” he said while addressing a joint press conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. “We have to have quality people coming in. Now by doing that, we’re expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. So I’m sort of on both sides of the argument, but what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people, come into our country. And we do that through the H-1B program,” he added. This marked a U-turn on H-1B visas for Trump; in 2016 he called them "very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, he imposed a temporary ban on the visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. The question for those whose lives and profits revolve around H-1B visas remains open – how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech? The H-1B visa program, which started in 1990, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that typically require a high level of technical expertise (fields such as IT, engineering, and healthcare). The visa is initially granted for three years, and can be extended by another three years. Every year, 85,000 such visas are up for grabs, through a lottery system. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Qualcomm Technologies, Ernst and Young, as well as outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, HCL America and others heavily rely on H-1B visas. Indian companies, who swarmed the US in large numbers at the height of the dotcom boom-in the 1990s are the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas.In May 2024, according to US State Department data from 2022, as much as 77% of 320,000 H-1B visa applications went to Indians. Indian companies are taking measures to counter any negative pushback with regard to H-1B visas, by hiring locals. For India’s second-largest information technology company Infosys, over 60% of the workforce in the US now comprises locals, Infosys’ Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka told media recently. TCS CEO Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that a decrease in H-1B visas can be offset by other strategies, such as relocating work to India, reducing the overall reliance on H-1B. From the first time Trump took charge in 2016, the US authorities have clamped down on frauds related to applications from H-1B, increased the cost of filings [upwards of $8,000] and even limited repeated filings, in an effort to make the system fair. As a result, people can no longer submit multiple applications to increase their chances of winning the lottery, as this creates an unfair advantage. The crackdown on frauds seemed to have worked to some extent. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] revealed that the number of entries for the year’s lottery stood at 470,342, marking a substantial 38% decline from the 758,994 entries received in 2023, according to a report by the Associated Press. Since December, both Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, seem to have offered their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the program needs a fix. “Easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,” Musk said days after telling critics to “go f*** yourself.” Immigrant attorneys believe that unlike the past, this time things may actually change. “The system is broken and it needs to be fixed, especially around the area of what is considered to be a job/service that cannot be done by a local and requires a special visa,” an attorney from a Washington-based law firm told RT. Meanwhile, India has used diplomatic language to advocate for favorable visa policies while emphasizing mutual benefits and India’s indispensable role in the partnership. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in early January, breaking his silence on the H-1B debate. Industry watchers believe that H-1B visas can still address the basic issues which led to its creation in the first place, i.e. supplying engineers to met tech’s gargantuan demands. “The H-1B program, which is based on numerical limits set over 30 years ago, still remains terribly short of meeting the needs of the US economy in the global competition for talent, particularly in STEM fields,” believes Ashank Desai, Principal Founder and former Chairman of Mastek as well as founding member of Indian software lobby firm NASSCOM. Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman and Founder of 5F World, and formerly CEO of Zensar, a Pune-based outsourcing firm, told RT the H-1B mindset needs to change “from wage arbitrage to quality of talent. In many ways, it needs to evolve.” Ultimately, the next move of the Trump administration will significantly impact India’s exports. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s total exports reached $776.68 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Software exports alone account for about 4% of the country’s GDP and generate approximately 5.4 million direct jobs and nearly 20 million indirect jobs. Therefore, any changes to visa policies are likely to affect India’s export landscape.

Title: There’s Still Money to Be Made at Sundance — Or So Producers Hope
URL: http://www.vulture.com/article/sundance-25-theres-still-money-to-be-made-on-indie-films.html

Kicking off its 11-day run Thursday and showcasing 88 feature films painstakingly selected from a record-high 16,000 submissions this year, the Sundance Film Festival remains a sui generis staging ground for the kind of buzzy, splashy titles that tend to explode out of Park City and ripple across popular culture. The mordant, Rose Byrne-starring dramedy If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, with its Conan O’Brien cameo? Director Bill Condon’s remake of the novel adaptation-turned-Broadway musical-turned-Oscar-winning 1985-drama Kiss of the Spider Woman, co-starring Jennifer Lopez? Director David France’s documentary Free Leonard Peltier which premieres just days after President Biden actually freed the well-known Indigenous activist (who was convicted of killing two FBI agents and spent the last five decades behind bars)? Any or all of them could become inescapable water-cooler conversation over the next twelve months if Sundance’s past remains its prologue. But business as usual at Sundance is hardly guaranteed this year, with catastrophic L.A. wildfires still burning, an impending move from the festival’s longtime base in Utah’s Wasatch mountains, and a recent shitstorm of corporate layoffs, depressed media stock prices, and metastasizing unemployment in film projects. In the afterglow of CODA, which won Sundance’s Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award before going on to win Best Picture at the 2022 Academy Awards, Hollywood still looks to Park City as a blast-off pad for future Oscar bait. Toward that end, Jesse Eisenberg’s awards season contender A Real Pain (nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar Thursday morning) and art-house dark horse A Different Man (Best Makeup and Hairstyling), in addition to the Best Feature Documentary nominees Sugarcane, Black Box Diaries, Porcelain War and Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat all got their start at Sundance ‘24. But more generally, Sundance can be understood to provide a kind of bellwether for the health of independent film as both a cinematic genre and business model. “It just gives you this snapshot, almost like a crystal ball,” says Eugene Hernandez, the fest’s director and head of public programming. “You get this moment to peer into the future. These are the films that will be coming later in the year. It is a great moment to take stock of what the year in film has told us, and what do we see coming around the bend?” Despite the industry being significantly diminished by twin Hollywood strikes and pandemic hangover, a cross-section of independent producers hoping to sell films at Sundance tell Vulture they are, nonetheless, bullish on indie filmdom. While the boom times — when platforms like Amazon showed up at the festival with a veritable Brinks truck full of cash to splash out on an entire slate of films — may be firmly in the past, industry machers say there is a wider variety of outlets acquiring independent movies for distribution, both streaming and theatrically, than at any time in recent memory. “If you make a good movie nowadays for a moderate price, I believe there are 10 places that can competitively buy that film,” says Josh Peters, a former director of acquisitions at Focus Features who is a producer on this year’s “coming-of-age drama where the person doesn’t get to come of age” Ricky. “Buyers are being more pragmatic. And I’m noticing a group of financiers who are willing, in the aggregate, to put in a couple hundred thousand here, a couple hundred thousand there. So there’s an ecosystem of buyers telling artists, Take risks. Challenge yourself. Do what’s important to you.” At the Toronto International Film Festival in September, producers Duncan Montgomery and Alex Orlovsky premiered and sold distribution rights for The Last Showgirl to Roadside Attractions, then launched a quick-turnaround theatrical release and awards-qualifying run in December. Now in Park City with the Premieres section thriller Lurker (about a young man who becomes obsessed with an up-and-coming pop star played by Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe), Montgomery contrasts Sundance’s sunny sense of optimism with the kind of mad dash into awards season that a TIFF acquisition deal most often entails. “It feels like there’s a bit of a wind in the sails of indie films,” Montgomery says. “I’m not going to say I know what buyers think. But I’m hopeful that there’s a positive vibe going in. And there’s something about the new year: [Sundance’s] placement in the third week in January. There’s promise. There’s hope. As opposed to those fall festivals where there’s lots of stress.” Several producers point out that disruptions surrounding the 2023 strikes — production shutdowns, release delays, overall starvation of filmic product at the cineplex — contributed to an uptick in the amount of indie fare reaching screens last year. That comes into clearest focus with the awards-y titles that have remained in the cultural conversation through today’s Oscars nominations announcement. Among them: Demi Moore’s body-horror comeback vehicle The Substance, director Gia Coppola’s The Last Showgirl, the controversial Trump biopic The Apprentice, A Different Man (for which star Sebastian Stan won a Golden Globe this month) and the prison-thespian bio-drama Sing Sing. All generated strong buzz at festivals including Toronto, Cannes and Sundance en route to their respective public offerings. That’s part of the calculus behind producers David Siegel and Scott McGehee repeatedly taking their films to the festival since 1994 and aiming to land placement this year for their Gulf War-adjacent crisis-actor comedy Atropia, whose ensemble cast includes Alia Shawcat, Callum Turner, Chloe Sevigny and Channing Tatum. Over that time, the producers have observed Sundance’s imprimatur assuming increasing importance in both marketing and public recognition. “It seems like the audience has really evolved,” McGehee says. “And they are really paying attention to box office now, to film festivals, to reviews. The way audiences engage with the business of the film industry is very different. So these days it seems like audiences care about the lineage that a film has in getting to them. And distributors care about having those things to present to an audience.” While the fest’s renown as North America’s preeminent showcase for indie cinema remains beyond dispute, its pedestal for documentary titles has been complicated by the non-fiction film genre’s declining bankability. Since the N95 era, theatrical turnout for doc features has plummeted in almost inverse proportion to their increasing streaming popularity. But this year, of course, four out of five nominees for the Best Documentary Feature Oscar came from Sundance. And to hear it from Topic Studios’ head of film and documentaries Ryan Heller — who heads to Sundance with the documentaries It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley and the Norwegian “high school movie set at the edge of the earth” Folktales — finding a sweet spot between distributor and material is still achievable. “We’re in a moment where the buyers continue to be very specific and savvy about what works for them,” Heller says. “We’re not in a moment where a buyer is coming in saying, I need five movies. It’s more, If we see something we love, we’ll buy it. But looking at last year’s Sundance, there’s a real case to be made that the right buyer for the right movie is still a perfect match.” Longtime industry pass holder Kevin Iwashina hits Park City this week with the Glenn Kaino-directed short film he produced, Hoops, Hopes & Dreams — it unpacks an unconventional political strategy by Martin Luther King Jr. and an all-star team of ’60s civil rights activists who used pick-up basketball to rally young voters and build networks of empowerment for disenfranchised communities. When I question Iwashina about the health of indie film as a genre, he quickly corrects me: “Indie film is a financial model; it’s not a genre.” From there, the producer takes a brickbat to distinctions between mainstream and independent movies he feels are increasingly irrelevant to Generation Z. “We’re now in a period where there is a range of cinema, a range of quality. Sometimes that quality is going to come in the form of something made outside the system like Anora. And sometimes it’s going to come from within, like The Wild Robot,” Iwashina continues. “A24, as far as any young person is concerned, isn’t indie movies. Those are movies. I think categorically, we just have to redefine and not ghettoize this concept of indie.” “Let’s stop playing identity politics with movies,” he adds. “We know what happened when we did that in the election.”

While Amazon and Walmart may be fierce competitors in the retail world, their commitment to helping those in need during times of crisis proves even corporate rivals can unite in the face of disaster. Both companies have pledged significant financial support to assist victims of the recent wildfires ravaging the Los Angeles area, offering critical resources to affected communities, first responders and local organizations. Their collective efforts highlight the power of corporate philanthropy when disaster strikes. Amazon committed $10 million to support relief efforts for communities in the Los Angeles area affected by recent wildfires, many of those communities home to Amazon employees and their families. The donation will go to local and national disaster response organizations, including the American Red Cross, FireAid, MusiCares Fire Relief and World Central Kitchen. Additionally, Amazon donated more than 415,000 essential items to 29 organizations, including fire stations and community groups, and continues to send supplies such as food, water, shelter items and medical equipment. The company is leveraging its AWS cloud technology, including drone support, to assist emergency responders. Meanwhile, Walmart donated $2.5 million to help Los Angeles fire victims. This includes donations of food, water, essential products and grants. The official statement from Walmart reads: “Associates, customers, and members in the communities we serve are experiencing the devastating impacts of the wildfires in Southern California. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we are acting quickly to help. Walmart, Sam’s Club, and the Walmart Foundation are committing $2.5 million to support relief efforts, including donations of food, water, essential products and grants. Over the past several days, Walmart stores in Southern California have donated food, water, and gift cards to help first responders and shelters support people in need. We’re also working with nonprofits and suppliers to bring resources into communities. Throughout the response, we’ll continue looking for ways to support our associates, customers, members, and their families.” Here’s a look at other notable developments from Amazon and Walmart in the past week: We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

To that point, 46% of workers who currently work from home at least sometimes would be somewhat or very unlikely to stay at their job if their employer scrapped remote work, according to a recent poll by Pew Research Center. Yet, employers have reined in remote work. About 75% of workers were required to be in the office a certain number of days per week or month as of October 2024, up from 63% in February 2023, Pew found. "There's a certain creeping up" of return-to-office policies, said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. Companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell Technologies, JPMorgan Chase, UPS and The Washington Post have called at least some employees back to the office five days a week. President Donald Trump signed an executive action on Monday calling federal employees back to their desks "as soon as practicable." Similar to the Pew survey, a poll conducted by Bamboo HR found that 28% of workers would consider quitting due to a return-to-office mandate. The data "underscores how comfortable people have become with this arrangement, and how it really fits in with their lifestyle," Parker said. Workers consistently cite a better work-life balance as a "huge benefit" of remote work, Parker said. Indeed, they see the financial value of hybrid work as being equivalent to an 8% raise, according to research by Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies workplace management. Many economists think that the higher prevalence of remote work, relative to the pre-pandemic era, has become an entrenched feature of the U.S. labor market. "Remote work is not going away," Bloom previously told CNBC. That's largely because it boost profits for companies: Workers quit less often, meaning employers save money on recruiting and other functions tied to attrition, Bloom said. Meanwhile, data shows that productivity doesn't suffer in hybrid work arrangements, he said. More from Personal Finance:How to know if a rental listing is a scamNow is an 'ideal time' to reassess your retirement savingsHow climate change is reshaping home insurance costs More than 60% of paid, full workdays were done remotely in early 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic — up from less than 10% before the pandemic, according to WFH Research, a project run jointly by researchers from MIT, Stanford, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That share has fallen by more than half. However, it has leveled out between 25% and 30% for about two years, according to WFH Research data. About 31% of employers reduced remote work opportunities in 2024, down from 43% in 2023, according to a ZipRecruiter survey. Yet, another 33% expanded remote work, up from 32% the prior year. Companies that imposed RTO mandates have annual rates of employee turnover that are 13% higher than those that have become "more supportive" of remote work, ZipRecruiter said. "The ability to work from anywhere remains a top priority for many professionals," according to a 2024 poll by consulting firm Korn Ferry of 10,000 workers in the U.S., U.K., Brazil, Middle East, Australia and India. Some businesses force workers back to the office precisely because they want workers to quit, experts said. It's a stealthy way of reducing headcount without having explicit layoffs, they said. "Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead a new advisory board dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, wrote in a November op-ed. On Monday, Ramaswamy told CNBC he was leaving DOGE to run for governor of Ohio. Of course, there are also trade-offs to remote work for businesses and workers. About 59% of employers cite concerns that remote work harms company culture, according to ZipRecruiter. About half of workers — 53% — who work from home at least part time say it "hurts" their ability to feel connected with co-workers, Pew found in a 2023 poll. "It's the one big downside we've seen consistently," Parker said. "That seems to be a tradeoff: You get the work-life balance but lose some connectivity with coworkers," Parker said. Even if workers quit, they may not be able to find a job. The labor market remains strong, with low unemployment and low levels of layoffs, meaning workers have good job security, according to economists. However, companies have also pulled back on hiring, making it a challenging environment for job seekers. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Amazon reportedly resumes green-card applications under Trump

Amazon (AMZN-0.79%) has reportedly restarted the application process for foreign workers to obtain green cards, Business Insider first reported, citing an internal memo from last year. The company resumed processing on Jan. 6, after a two-year pause in which the company suspended new PERM filings. While Amazon hasn’t provided a specific reason for resuming the program, it’s likely part of its plan to prepare for a more competitive labor market. The PERM, or Program Electronic Review Management process, impacts foreign workers who are seeking green cards. It requires companies to prove that hiring foreign employees won’t harm job opportunities or wages for U.S. workers. The process is both time-consuming – taking between 2 to 3 years – and expensive, with costs ranging from $2,500 to $20,000. Amazon’s decision to restart the PERM process comes as it scales back its operations in Canada. Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of seven warehouses in Quebec, alongside layoffs that impact nearly 2,000 workers. Amazon has eliminated more 27,000 roles across different departments from late 2022 onward. Earlier this month, it also laid off 200 employees from its Fashion and Fitness division. Despite these cuts, the resumption of green-card filings suggests Amazon may be seeking global talent to meet its future growth goals. The move appears to align with President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to offer green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, which could further expand Amazon’s potential talent pool. The tech giant is the second largest U.S. employer, behind Walmart (WMT+0.85%). This potential shif coincides with Amazon’s push for employees to return to the office. The company has warned that failure to comply with its return-to-office (RTO) policy could lead to termination. However, Amazon is having a tough time meeting office-space requirements for its sprawling workforce. Initially, Amazon planned for all employees to return to the office five days a week starting Jan. 2, 2025, but some locations are not yet prepared to accommodate the full staff.

Title: IP in the Octagon: Saving Live Sports from Digital Piracy

January 23, 2025, 12:15 PM 0 Share IPWatchdog LIVE Moves to March in 2025: “Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region.” The evolution of content distribution has been both a boon and a bane for the entertainment industry. From physical formats like CDs and DVDs to digital streaming over satellite, fiber-optic networks, 5G, and Wi-Fi, the rapid technological advancements have brought unmatched convenience to viewers. The shift feels seamless: connect a smart TV to Wi-Fi, and the days of waiting for the cable guy are over. For television show producers, however, the transition has come at a steep cost. Take, for instance, the creators and distributors of movies and live premium events. They have seen their revenue streams severely impacted, not immediately but gradually, as digital platforms opened doors to new vulnerabilities. In the past, the model was straightforward: install a satellite dish, pay a subscription, and gain access to live sports and Hollywood movies. Today, it’s a different story. Consumers can share Wi-Fi costs with neighbors or, worse, bypass paywalls entirely by typing “watch UFC live for free” into a search engine. Within seconds, dozens of links appear, granting free access to what should have been an $80 pay-per-view event. Let’s look at the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), a massively profitable martial arts promotion company. Despite its financial success, it is losing a significant amount of revenue to piracy. UFC CEO Dana White has repeatedly highlighted the massive challenges piracy creates, often calling out illegal streaming platforms and warning of legal action. Yet, pirates just laugh and openly mock these threats. One even tweeted in response to White: “Come and get it then, Dana. He’s desperate, making up lies and praying it scares away a few hundred people from clicking the link.” The challenges for content creators like the UFC are twofold. First, the market for pirated streams thrives because many fans either cannot or will not pay for legitimate access. Studies show that about 11% of U.S. adults admit to pirating live sports, TV, or movies, citing high costs as the primary reason. For millennials, the percentage climbs even higher, with nearly two-thirds acknowledging they’ve watched sports through unofficial streams. This behavior has real economic consequences. The Harvard Business Review estimates that piracy costs the global sports industry approximately $28 billion annually. The losses trickle down in ways many consumers don’t consider. Players, for example, have collective bargaining agreements that tie salaries to league revenues. When TV revenue declines due to piracy, salary caps tighten, directly impacting athlete earnings. It’s not just high-profile athletes who suffer; ordinary Americans employed by league media arms or regional sports networks also face layoffs when subscription and advertising revenue drops. The perception that piracy is a victimless crime ignores these broader realities. The second challenge lies in outdated copyright laws. The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 places the burden of enforcement on content creators. This notice-and-takedown system requires creators to identify infringements and report them to online service providers (OSPs), who are then expected to act “expeditiously.” But the definition of “expeditiously” is vague and varies by case. UFC executive vice president Riché T. McKnight testified before Congress in 2023 that some OSPs take hours or even days to remove pirated content. By that time, the economic damage is done. Failing to combat piracy risks losing an entire continent of viewers. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches to intellectual property rights and content distribution. The Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, boasts a rich history of martial arts and warrior traditions deeply embedded in its cultural identity. Combat sports such as wrestling and grappling have longstanding roots in the region, with practices like Koshti Pahlavani and Yagli Gures exemplifying traditions of martial honor and prowess. In Saudi Arabia, these practices often intertwine with Islamic values, framing martial arts as both physical disciplines and pathways to spiritual and personal development, frequently influenced by Sufi teachings. It’s no surprise, then, that combat sports have a significant audience in the Middle East. But while people in the region enjoy watching martial arts on television, the question remains: are they willing to pay for it? In April 2024, the UFC partnered with Starzplay to secure exclusive broadcasting rights in the Middle East and North Africa. Starzplay’s dedicated UFC channel promised comprehensive access to UFC content through its mobile application. Yet, did this strategic move meet expectations? The results suggest otherwise. Starzplay’s subscriber base remains modest at 2.9 million. By comparison, ESPN+ boasts 25.6 million subscribers, while Amazon Prime has reached a staggering 200 million. To put it bluntly, the initiative fell far short of expectations. The root of the issue lies in entrenched habits and a lack of a robust culture surrounding intellectual property rights. Changing the way viewers consume content requires more than exclusive deals; it demands a concerted effort to foster respect for legal streaming. Only a new culture of intellectual property management can transform these habits. Growth metrics for platforms like Starzplay will remain stagnant unless legal frameworks, technological innovation, and skilled IP professionals converge to reshape the landscape of content distribution in the region. Conventional business models in sports and premium television inadvertently facilitate content leakage, especially during live sports broadcasts. Current security measures, such as fingerprinting or watermarking technologies, are ineffective. It could be argued that within the context of news media distribution, video streaming represents a vital aspect of critical infrastructure, making it susceptible to malicious software attacks. In one example where the FBI disarmed a malware called Emotet, the agency explained how the malware worked: Usually delivered through an infected email attachment or link, the nimble and ever mutating code was able to slip past most virus detection software”. The concept of “appointment viewing”—television programming that individuals prioritize to watch during its original broadcast time due to a strong desire to witness events within the specified timeframe—exposes live sports content to significant risks of intellectual property (IP) rights violations. Sports leagues and media conglomerates stand to lose substantial audiences within minutes. This is due to the brief time it takes for viewers to search for alternative, unauthorized, free, or very cheap streams to watch live games or UFC fights. Preventing such leaks is time-critical, as audience interest rapidly declines once a live event concludes. Content is particularly vulnerable to unauthorized live redistribution while a sporting event is in progress. Is the centralization of video distribution the problem here? In traditional a video streaming platform, where one of the users pays for using the platform nothing stops that person to redistribute that televised live sport event. With the help of blockchain, the issue of ownership can be addressed at a protocol level. Blockchain helps the creators and the audience encrypt their videos and store those videos permanently using the IPFS swarm. Blockchain broadcasts the live sporting event in an autonomous manner with the help of various relay nodes and IPFS, thereby maintaining transparency and integrity of ownership in a decentralized way. It echoes overall U.S. Government strategy. The United States acknowledges the potential inherent in the modernization of its cryptographic technologies, which shall now encompass blockchain technology and its capacity to augment security and transparency. As the former U.S. Presidential Administration has explained, “digital connectivity should be a tool that uplifts and empowers people everywhere, not one used for repression and coercion.” Per the National Cybersecurity Strategy, “new and updated cybersecurity regulations must be calibrated to meet the needs of national security and public safety, in addition to the security and safety of individuals, regulated entities, and their employees, customers, operations, and data.” Implementing blockchain technology will inevitably help sport broadcasting giants to grow subscription numbers. Once streaming sporting event is “live”, the blocks, which are stored on a multitude of servers throughout the world, cannot be changed. As a result, sport Leagues and producers of the live broadcasts will have total control over their work. Blockchain-based television streaming systems is a new generation of digital infrastructure, that offer transparency through decentralization, allowing participating parties to verify data and transactions, avoid harmful cyber incidents. It is an example of “sector-specific engagement with industry to construct consistent, predictable regulatory frameworks for cybersecurity that focus on achieving security outcomes and enabling continuity of operations and functions, while promoting collaboration and innovation”. Put simply, it is a matter of national interest. The journey of the UFC in the Middle East illustrates the importance of live streaming in a region where cultural appreciation for combat sports runs deep. With smart TVs becoming increasingly accessible—not just in developed nations but globally—the potential audience for live sports is enormous. We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to chaos—a world where video pirates evolve into organized crime syndicates, dominating the streaming landscape. The other path offers a vision of fairness and innovation: a distributed network governed by blockchain technology, fostering harmony between creators and consumers.

Title: Amazon resumes new US green card applications for foreign workers, leaked memo shows

Amazon has resumed the green-card application process for foreign workers, a sign of an improving job market. In an internal note from late 2024, obtained by Business Insider, Amazon told employees that it planned to reopen PERM processing on January 6. Amazon had suspended all new PERM filings in 2023 and throughout 2024, citing "labor market conditions," BI previously reported. PERM is part of the US Labor Department's permanent labor certification process and is typically the first step toward getting a green card for a foreign worker. The goal is to prove that hiring foreign workers won't affect US job seekers' opportunities, wages, or working conditions. The note didn't explain why Amazon was resuming the PERM process. But the change may reflect Amazon's outlook for a more competitive job market. It also follows Donald Trump's campaign proposal to give green cards to foreign graduates of US colleges. "We evaluate our PERM program based on market analysis and have been planning to reopen it for the last 9 months," Amazon's spokesperson said in an email to BI. Amazon has been making major job cuts since late 2022, laying off at least 27,000 employees. Just last week Amazon let go about 200 people in its fashion and fitness group, BI reported. Richard Herman, a Cleveland-based immigration lawyer who founded the Herman Legal Group, said that resuming PERM filings indicates Amazon sees a possible "rebound" in the job market. Herman said some companies previously suspended green-card filings because of widespread layoffs and the cost and time required to process PERMs with the Labor Department. With PERM, companies have to demonstrate that laid-off employees aren't qualified for the jobs intended for foreign workers while also notifying US workers laid off within the past six months of the anticipated PERM filing. That takes a lot of money and time. "If employers are reconsidering getting back into the PERM game, it's because their cost/benefit analysis suggests labor market changes favor a more competitive market in some occupations, justifying the costs/time invested in PERM," Herman said. Tech companies are still laying off employees and applying more stringent performance reviews. But the hiring trend may improve. The HR-software maker Karat said in a 2024 report that the average hiring target for software engineer roles among US tech companies was up by 12% year over year. Stripe laid off 300 employees this week but said it planned to grow its total head count by roughly 1,000 this year, BI previously reported. "Tech in the Bay Area is definitely hiring more, and so they have a positive view of what's ahead," Bill Hing, an immigration law professor at the University of San Francisco, told BI. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he'd like to give green cards to every foreign graduate of US colleges as part of a plan to attract more skilled immigrants. That has led to a clash between the Elon Musk-led pro-Trump tech leaders and the hardcore MAGA base over the legal immigration of skilled workers. While it's possible Trump will commit to his proposal, he hasn't publicly addressed it since, and he could change his mind. Trump's campaign clarified last year that his proposal would apply only to the "most thoroughly vetted" foreign students. Jennifer Gordon, a labor and immigration law professor at Fordham University, told BI that companies might be trying to anticipate Trump's unpredictable behavior. Given Trump's past hard-line stance against immigration, Gordon said it's possible the new administration would issue a policy pausing skilled labor immigration applications in the future. "If I was a tech company, I wouldn't be fully confident that he will follow through," Gordon said. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip?

Title: CNN boss Mark Thompson confirms 200 layoffs across cable TV network in digital push

CNN boss Mark Thompson on Thursday revealed sweeping changes at the embattled network that include 200 job cuts and a pivot to a more digital-centric strategy, the company said. The layoffs at the Warner Bros Discovery-owned network will amount to 6% of CNN’s workforce – mainly producers, editors and other non-air talent vital to the TV operation. Thompson, the former New York Times executive who pushed the Gray Lady toward a digital future, laid out his vision for a revamped CNN in an internal memo obtained by The Post. “Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN’s gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting,” Thompson wrote. As part of the overhaul, Thompson confirmed reports earlier in the week that veteran anchor Wolf Blitzer will be moved from his afternoon slot to host a morning show with Pamela Brown at 10 a.m. – a decision that will cost frequent Donald Trump critic Jim Acosta his morning gig. Acosta is expected to be exiled to a midnight shift, a decision that has left him fuming and reportedly threatening to quit. With the job cuts, CNN seeks to streamline its cable TV lineup and enhance its digital subscription offerings to better align with evolving viewer trends. Thompson said CNN has started development on a new streaming service for news programming similar to its TV product. CNN also plans to launch a new lifestyle-oriented product this year, the memo said, adding that CNN is looking to open up and fill at least 100 new posts in the coming months as part of the shift to digital. “Some of today’s announcements mean significant new job opportunities at CNN, but others will lead to the loss of some valued colleagues,” Thompson wrote in the memo. “That too is an unwelcome but inevitable part of the change process.” CNN declined to comment. NBC News, owned by Comcast, also announced job cuts late Thursday that are reportedly expected to include up to a few dozens staffers. In October, CNN introduced a digital paywall requiring some users to pay $3.99 per month for access to its content. The move aimed to create a new digital revenue stream as the network looks to offset the decline in TV. The digital efforts were financed by a $70 million investment from WBD, Thompson added.

Never miss a story. “This is a moment where the digital story feels like an existential question,” Thompson told the New York Times. “If we do not follow the audiences to the new platforms with real conviction and scale, our future prospects will not be good.” Warner Bros Discovery is undergoing significant restructuring and said last month that it plans to split its cable TV networks from its streaming and studio operations, forming two separate units. Under the new structure, the cable TV business — including CNN, TNT and Animal Planet — will be consolidated into a unit named Global Linear Networks. “In the end, this is about CNN being — as it has been in its history — an indispensable way in which many, many millions of people get their news,” Thompson told the Times. The shakeup comes as CNN – which has attempted to tack toward the center since WBD acquired the network in a merger in 2022 – lags far behind cable rivals Fox News and left-leaning MSNBC. CNN’s viewership has only gotten worse since Trump won the election and its web traffic has also suffered, hitting a two-year low in December, according to analytics firm Comscore. The network recorded 90.5 million unique visits that month – down from a peak of 175.5 million in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the firm said. CNN told the Times other news networks have seen similar declines. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said earlier this month it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses. In November, the Associated Press said it would cut about 8% of its workforce as it looks to modernize its operations and products. Advertisement

Title: Amazon UK Boss Says “Greater Share” Of Prime Video TV Spend Shifting To Britain, But Streamer Would Never Have Commissioned ‘Mr Bates’

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Prime Video is shifting a greater share of its overall TV spend to Britain, according to Amazon UK boss Chris Bird. Bird was speaking on a Royal Television Society (RTS) panel predicting the year in UK TV, alongside the likes of Fremantle UK boss Amelia Brown, who said the industry has “lost its guts a bit” when it comes to taking risks. Bird said Amazon commissioning budgets are “really healthy and strong” this year in Britain despite American contraction, and “as we go forward a greater share of investment at global level is centered here in the UK.” Last year, Amazon initiated a major international restructure that saw layoffs in the Africa and MENA regions as focus shifted to Europe, although there were also some European firings amid the downturn. Related Stories News BBC's 'The Traitors' Scores Record Audience For Season Three Finale (Spoilers Included!) News 'The Traitors UK' Season 3 Crowns Winner On BBC One Bird pointed to Amazon tentpole Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which is filmed in the UK and “works disproportionately well in the UK but the remit and ambition is to perform globally,” along with local hits like Clarkson’s Farm, which was made “specifically for Brits.” Watch on Deadline Amazon won’t be tempted to go as local as shows like Mr Bates vs the Post Office, however, with Bird acknowledging that the ITV smash was “too British” to have been commissioned by an American streamer. Go with your gut Bird was speaking on a panel alongside big hitters in the UK industry like Fremantle’s Brown, who delivered an impassioned plea for execs on both sides of the commissioning fence to take risks. “Our industry has maybe lost its guts a little bit [in terms of] going for what they believe in across the board,” she said. Brown cited BBC breakout The Traitors, which wraps up this week. “It got pitched around a few places and then the BBC said, ‘We will do it,’ so the gut instinct was there,” she explained. “Every broadcaster was then pitched versions of what we are now calling ‘psychological reality’. And that’s more on [producers] to say that derivatives and versions are never going to be the thing that hits so we need to go with our guts and with creativity.” Brown, who oversees the likes of The Apprentice, Britain’s Got Talent and Too Hot To Handle, said this is becoming trickier as young viewers disengage from traditional TV. With this in mind, BBC unscripted boss Kate Phillips argued the corporation’s biggest rival is no longer the streamers but is now YouTube, TikTok and gaming. “We want to grow love of the BBC with the young and they are becoming very distracted by these other platforms,” she added. “It’s about making them aware of the things we’ve got sometimes – a good show is a good show but it’s about getting [young people] off their devices and off YouTube.” The BBC is struggling to fund big-budget drama at present but Phillips said premium unscripted is not being hit in the same way due to its lower cost, although she is still busily seeking partnerships “We are not as reliant as drama is [on co-pro money] and can still fully fund programs but in terms of upping the ambition we are certainly open to partnerships,” she added, citing the BBC’s tie-up with NBC, which birthed The Traitors, and second window deals with the likes of BBC Studios-owned channel group UKTV. The trio were speaking in London at the RTS session. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Why Amazon’s Decision in Quebec Raises Familiar Questions
URL: https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/why-amazons-decision-in-quebec-raises-familiar-questions
Time Published: 2025-01-23T01:16:07Z

Good e-Reader 22 January 2025 by Angela Waterfield 2 Comments Amazon recently announced it’s closing all its operations in Quebec.This move will cut about 1,950 jobs, including 1,700 full-time workers. The company says it’s shifting back to a third-party delivery model, claiming this will save customers money. But labor unions and critics are asking: Is this really about saving money, or is it about getting rid of unionized workers? This isn’t the first time Amazon’s decisions have raised eyebrows. In February 2023, I wrote about Amazon laying off 18,000 workers. At the time, the company blamed inflation, slowing sales, and supply chain issues. But many of us questioned whether those layoffs were more about automation and avoiding unions. What’s happening in Quebec now feels like history repeating itself. One of the sites closing is the DXT4 warehouse in Laval, Amazon’s first unionized warehouse in Canada. Workers there joined the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in May 2024 and were negotiating their first contract when the closure was announced. The CSN says Amazon’s decision targets unionized workers and violates the Quebec Labour Code. Amazon denies any ill intentions and accuses the CSN of spreading false information. It’s worth noting that the CSN aren’t alone in wondering about this- as just last August, a Quebec labor tribunal ruled against Amazon for interfering in union efforts at another site in Lachine. Automation seems to play a big role in Amazon’s decisions. While the company hasn’t said the Quebec closures are about robots, it’s worth noting that Amazon has been building more robotic warehouses where machines do the work people used to do. There’s also the issue of unionization. Unionized workers typically earn around 10% more and receive more comprehensive benefits than their non-unionized counterparts. They’re also more likely to have better access to employer-sponsored health plans and paid sick days. For a company focused on minimizing costs, unionized workers may represent a financial challenge Amazon would rather avoid. By closing its only unionized warehouse in Canada, Amazon may be signaling a preference for non-unionized labor, where wages and benefits can remain lower. This pattern raises questions about whether cost-cutting decisions are being made under the guise of automation or operational efficiency while effectively undermining workers’ rights. Amazon says the switch to third-party delivery in Quebec is an operational decision. But the timing—right after unionization and during labor negotiations—feels off. Quebec’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne, came out criticizing the move, saying, “This is not the way business is done in Canada.” This isn’t just about Quebec or Canada for that matter. This trend is part of a larger story about how companies like Amazon are focusing on cutting costs and automating jobs, often at the expense of their workers. This story also highlights how hard it is for unions to protect workers in industries moving toward automation and AI. In my 2023 article, I wrote, “If you’re going to replace workers with robots because it’s cheaper and easier than dealing with unions, just be honest about it.” That still rings true. People appreciate transparency, and without it, companies risk losing the trust of their employees and customers. Amazon could take a different approach. It’s not impossible to invest in both technology and fair treatment for workers. Instead of seeing unions as the enemy, companies could work with them to find solutions that work for everyone. “Today’s workers need ongoing, incremental re-skilling or upskilling to maintain a stable or improving career path. Displaced workers need substantive retraining to get their next job or career. Young people entering the workforce need a foundation of skills aligned with their aptitudes and the prevailing demand for human labor.” – Yossi Sheffi Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.” Amazon’s actions in Quebec point towards a lack of transparency and honesty. Perhaps these closures have nothing to do with unions, but until they’re willing to be fully upfront on their reasoning, people will continue to ask tough questions about their motives. It doesn’t help that Amazon has a long history of questionable business practices and has been the subject of several lawsuits; including antitrust, class action, and lawsuits over product recall. Companies like Amazon need to realize that innovation and fairness can go hand in hand, and it’s time they start proving it.

Title: CNN plans to lay off hundreds of employees, cut costs as NBC plots firings

CNN boss Mark Thompson reportedly plans to announce mass layoffs Thursday — just days after he warned top on-air talent including Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper that they ought to avoid “pre-judging” President Trump. The ratings-challenged cable news pioneer will lay off hundreds of employees as it refocuses the business around a global digital audience, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The job cuts come as CNN, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, looks to rearrange its linear TV lineup and build out digital subscription products, CNBC said, adding that it will help CNN lower production costs and consolidate teams. Some shows produced in New York or Washington may move to Atlanta, where production can be done more cheaply, the report said. NBC News, owned by Comcast, is also planning job cuts later this week, according to the report. While there is no exact number, the layoffs will be well under 50. Comcast and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said earlier this month it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses. In November, the Associated Press said it would cut about 8% of its workforce as it looks to modernize its operations and products. News of CNN’s culling comes after Thompson reportedly cautioned staffers “against expressing any outrage of their own” during the inauguration. Thompson, a former BBC and New York Times executive, convened a virtual editorial meeting Sunday that included Tapper, Cooper and scores of other senior news personalities to discuss CNN’s coverage of the inaugural ceremonies that took place the next day in Washington, DC, according to the Status newsletter. During the meeting, Thompson “made it clear that he did not want the coverage to relitigate the past,” according to Status reporter Oliver Darcy — an allusion to CNN’s historically hostile relationship with Trump. Thompson asked his charges to avoid editorializing as well as to steer coverage away from focusing on Trump’s legal problems, including convictions for falsifying business documents related to the alleged Stormy Daniels “hush money” payment, according to the report. Instead, he urged CNN staffers to focus on Trump’s second term and to be “open-minded” about the next four years, according to Status. A CNN spokesperson declined to comment. At the end of the call, Thompson reportedly opened the floor to allow staffers to ask questions, but nobody spoke up, the report said. “What Thompson and other top brass had communicated was clear and none of the meeting participants apparently had the desire to question the guidance,” Darcy wrote. On Tuesday, Thompson convened yet another virtual editorial call to reiterate his message. Thompson told CNN staff that they should remain “tough-minded” in coverage while at the same time being “fair-minded,” according to Status. During the call, Virginia Moseley, CNN’s executive editor, joked that CNN was “out of practice” handling the relentless news cycle generated by Trump, a challenge that will quickly intensify in the coming years. Thompson’s strategy marks a shift in the network’s coverage of Trump under former CNN boss Jeff Zucker. CNN has struggled to keep up with MSNBC and Fox News in the ratings race — which was reflected in the numbers for the inauguration. Fox News, which shares common ownership with The Post, dominated television viewership during Trump’s inauguration, drawing 10.3 million viewers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET, surpassing all other networks. ABC (with 4.7 million viewers), NBC (4.4 million) and CBS (4.1 million) followed. With Post wires Advertisement

Title: Amazon to close Quebec facilities, but says it's not because of that new union

Amazon just announced it will be closing its Quebec facilities in the coming weeks, according to reporting by CBC . This move will cut more than 1,700 jobs. The company said it will begin outsourcing deliveries to smaller contractors, instead of relying on its in-house team. "Following a recent review of our Quebec operations," the company said in a statement, "we found that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to the one we had until 2020, will enable us to offer the same excellent service and deliver even greater savings to our customers in the long term." Amazon has announced it will shutter its facilities in Quebec in the coming weeks and cut more than 1,700 jobs. Quebec is home to Amazon's only unionized workforce in Canada. https://t.co/zG3XjTi1mH — CBC News (@CBCNews) January 22, 2025 Amazon has announced it will shutter its facilities in Quebec in the coming weeks and cut more than 1,700 jobs. Quebec is home to Amazon's only unionized workforce in Canada. https://t.co/zG3XjTi1mH This follows a successful unionization bid at an Amazon warehouse in Quebec. The workers joined the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), which represents around 330,000 people across many industries in Canada. Amazon allegedly fought these efforts, going on to say that union accreditation would not “respect the interests of its employees.” "This decision makes no sense whatsoever," CSN president Caroline Senneville said in a statement. "Neither from a business point of view, nor from an operational point of view. Amazon, one of the most integrated companies between the click of a mouse and home delivery, would entrust all its warehousing and distribution operations throughout Quebec to a third party?" Don’t worry. Amazon says the massive layoffs aren’t because of the aforementioned union, indicating it was a simple cost-cutting measure. We should absolutely take the company at its word because it has always been particularly friendly to unions and a friend to workers everywhere. That was sarcasm. In any event, it is expected that the company will close the facilities within the next two months. Employees will be given a severance package of some kind, but the details have yet to be revealed. Apropos of nothing, Amazon is worth nearly $2.5 trillion dollars. It has doubled in value in the past year or so.

Title: Trump Signs RTO Order—What’s Happening To Remote Jobs In 2025?

Everytime you receive news that your job is on the line or you’re forced to leave your role due to ... [+] remote work policies, use it as an opportunity to try something new and reinvent yourself "We're moving in a new direction." "We're undergoing a restructure." "This is our year of efficiency." "We're headed in a different place right now." "The company is undergoing downsizing to reduce waste." How many times have you received a notice or email that included any of these lines? The anxiety creeps and your heart starts pounding because you already know what follows...you're fired. Or at least, you're on the chopping block and can expect your role to be eliminated at any moment. We've barely completed the first quarter of 2025, and already the workplace is experiencing major upheavals. BP is cutting 5% of its workforce as part of its "simplify and focus" plan, and joins companies like Meta and Bridgewater Associates, who announced plans to cut 5% and 7% of their headcount respectively. And to add to 2025's unfolding workplace drama, newly appointed President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday forcing all federal workers to cease working remotely, or they will be fired, with some exemptions being permissible. This news comes on the heels of Amazon's five-days-a-week RTO policy implementation as of January 1, according to Business Insider. Trump's executive order could potentially impact 1.1 million federal employees who are eligible to work remotely (out of the 2.28 million government workers)—228,000 of them who are already fully remote, based on figures from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s report to Congress in August 2024. The goal? To ultimately shrink the federal workforce in line with the goals of the newly-created government thinktank and temporary Department of Government Efficiency, nicknamed DOGE, which is focused on slashing costs and expenditure of resources across government agencies by 2026. In fact, tech mogul Elon Musk who heads the operation, stated in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed alongside Vivek Ramaswamy that "requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome," referring to the loophole in statutory civil-service protections that allows “reductions in force” that don’t target specific employees. "If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home," he said. The intent behind forcing eligible federal workers and current fully-remote government employees to work remotely five days a week comes as no surprise. Other major companies such as Amazon have been suspected of quiet firing in an effort to drive efficiency (quiet firing is the practice of creating hostile, demotivating, or other negative conditions at work that create a condition where employees voluntarily hand in their resignations, which reduces the need to go through the process and consultations associated with firing). A recent ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 U.S. managers found that "45% of companies anticipate layoffs in 2025, with many citing economic concerns, AI automation, and the incoming Trump administration’s policies as influencing factors." Additionally, a recent Pew Research Center survey noted that nearly half (46%) of remote workers say they would readily leave their job if no longer permitted to work from home. Although of course, labor unions and others are using their rights to sue and push back against anti-remote work policies such as those advocated and enforced by Trump and his allies, the fact remains that incidents like these create hostility towards professionals who already work from home, and a culture of remote work being taboo. If you're a federal employee (or work at a company that's in the process of enforcing RTO mandates) and you work from home in a hybrid arrangement, or are 100% remote, here are a few steps you should take now so you can continue to work remotely and feel supported in your goals: Whenever quiet firing occurs, prioritize taking care of your mental health First, it's OK to feel enraged, slighted, and hurt after providing years of service to the same employer and consistently being a high performer, especially if you're a public servant. It's natural to feel shock and anxiety during moments like these. This is why it's critical now, more than ever before, to take care of your mental wellbeing and take time to breathe, and acknowledge and express your feelings. Find or create a support network. Take up a new hobby. Throw yourself into something healthy that will distract you from your current employment situation. Understand that it's fine to not have everything together in your life, and what you're feeling is likely what thousands of other workers are feeling right now. Whenever you hear about a "restructuring" or "flattening structures" within the workforce of your company, consider it a time for change—not just for them, but for you. If they can head in a new direction, so can you. It's time to shift your perspective and, although it's easier said than done, view it positively, because this is your chance to rediscover yourself. After all, you are the architect of your future. No one, not even an employer that you've held a decades-long commitment to, has the right or power to control your life and whether or not you achieve your career and financial goals. Sometimes, major negative events occur in our lives so that we can rethink the meaning of our existence. It gives us time to pause and reflect about whether we want to continue working in the same role, or whether it's time to try something new. Your challenge is to use this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself and try something new. Take time for your hobbies and try online personality tests and quizzes to understand your core values and passions. This can help you shift your focus from seeing your current employment situation as a negative thing, to actually viewing it as a catalyst for positive change in your life. This is because often, you won't progress in your career and fulfil your potential until you're uncomfortable with your work environment. Discomfort creates change. Next, it's time to dust off your resume and LinkedIn profile and update them. In fact, go ahead and give them a total overhaul. If you're serious about finding remote work, you need to be proactive about displaying the right skills in your resume—especially skills that are in high demand for most remote jobs, like roles in marketing, project management, and AI. Although you can use traditional sites like Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter to find remote jobs, it's much easier to locate them through job boards that specialize in remote and flexible work such as FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, and Remote.co. Additionally, the start-up incubator Y Combinator has a job board on its website that is constantly being updated for remote jobs at start-ups. And of course, don't forget to reach out to your network and strategically build new connections. Freelancing is a viable and increasingly popular alternative to traditional employment. There are expected to be more than 86 million freelancers (half the U.S. workforce) by 2027, so why not use your skills to join them and make money? As a freelancer, you have more control over your hours and location of employment, so this is highly favorable for remote work, and you can start building your freelance business immediately. The success of your freelance business is in proportion to your expertise, marketing, and research, and will grow as fast as the hours and effort you put in. Freelancing is one of the easiest ways to find a remote job straight away Remote work and hybrid working isn't over in 2025.

Your one-stop shop for data visualizations that explain complicated and cool stuff in digestible ways. top spots The tech industry has seen some brutal layoffs in recent years — but, if employee reviews are anything to go by, Big Tech companies are at least keeping their existing workers happy. To uncover the best states and cities for Big Tech employees, Switch On Business analyzed Glassdoor employee reviews for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta published between January 2023 and October 2024, then ranked companies' locations by average employee rating. The best city for Apple workers was Palo Alto, California, where employee ratings average at 4.48 out of five. The biggest disparity between the highest- and lowest-rated cities belonged to Amazon. The company's employees gave Herndon, Virginia, an average rating of 4.24, compared to just 2.73 in Buena Park, California. There wasn't a single US location where Google or Microsoft employees rated their experience below 4.0, on average. Meta's best state for workers was Florida (4.29), while the worst-rated was California (3.90). When it comes to the lowest-rated places for tech workers, company headquarters were often among the spots with the poorest employee reviews. Click images to enlarge Via Switch On Business.

January 21, 2025 08:00 ET | Source: Resilinc Resilinc MILPITAS, CA, Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resilinc, the leading provider of supply chain resiliency solutions, is sharing exclusive new data revealing the top drivers of supply chain disruptions for 2024. The data compiled by Resilinc’s EventWatchAI, a 24/7 risk monitoring database, reveals that overall disruptions to global supply chains increased 38% from the previous year. The top five disruptions for 2024 include: Factory fires maintained their position as the number one disruption for the sixth consecutive year, with 2,299 disruption alerts issued. Fortunately, this number is down 20% from the previous year and has declined 36% from the record high in 2022. Labor disruptions made it into the top five list for the second year in a row, jumping up to the second spot with a 47% year-over-year increase. Labor issues played a major role in impacting most industries in the U.S. and globally, including company and site-level strikes, national strikes, labor protests, and layoffs. From the ILA U.S. port strike, impacting over 47,000 workers, and the Canadian rail strike to major layoffs at tech giants Intel, Dell, and Amazon, labor disruptions continued its streak as a key risk area for 2024. Financial risk areas, including business sales, leadership transitions, and mergers and acquisitions, rounded out the top five disruptions for 2024. While business sales climbed a steady 17% YoY, leadership transitions surged 95% last year. Several notable transitions included leadership changes at Boeing, Nestlé, Pfizer Limited, and Intel. While mergers and acquisitions saw a slight decline of 5%, they remained a top disruption for 2024. Though the number of disruption alerts increased overall, several risk areas experienced substantial year-over-year increases; for example, extreme weather jumped a dramatic 119%. Consistent with this trend, flood-related alerts surged by 214%, forest fires increased by 88%, and hurricanes/typhoons jumped by 101%, underscoring the growing impact of extreme weather risks. Other noteworthy trends highlighted in the data include a 146% rise in labor violations such as forced labor, poor working conditions, and health and safety violations, among others. Geopolitical risk alerts climbed 123% after a brief dip in 2023, and protests/riots saw an astounding 285% YoY increase, marking the largest growth increase of all risk events tracked by Resilinc. Regulatory change alerts, which include tariffs, changes in laws, environmental regulations, and bans, continued their upward trend with a 128% YoY increase. The five most disrupted industries included Life Sciences, Healthcare, General Manufacturing, High Tech, and Automotive, marking the fourth year in a row that these particular industries have been the most impacted. Of all the 22,522 EventWatchAI notifications sent, more than half (59%) were impactful enough to trigger the creation of a WarRoom—virtual platforms in the Resilinc dashboard where customers and their suppliers communicate and collaborate to assess and resolve disruptions—emphasizing that disruptions not only increased in 2024 but also had a heightened impact on global supply chains. Resilinc’s data is gathered by its 24/7 global event monitoring Artificial Intelligence, EventWatch AI, which collects information and monitors news on 400 different types of disruptions across 104 million sources including traditional news sources, social media platforms, wire services, videos, and government reports.

Title: Indie Agencies Seek a Competitive Edge as Talent Rejects WPP Office Mandate

The stage is set! Advertisers, don't miss this cultural moment. ADWEEK House The Big Game is headed to New Orleans on February 7. RSVP. WPP made a bold move last week as the first major company in the ad industry to mandate that its 100,000-plus employees around the globe must return to the office four days per week. Five years on from the pandemic, there are legitimate reasons to return. Following in the footsteps of other major corporations, from Amazon to Toyota, WPP executives are eager to increase productivity, strengthen culture, and utilize dormant office space. But the decision has gotten under the skin of many employees who thrive working remotely or in a hybrid role, who have caregiving responsibilities at home—or who simply don’t appreciate being told where to work. A petition started by WPP employees on Change.org pushing back on the mandate has garnered more than 16,000 signatures so far. WPP is not the only holding company to enforce a return to office. Publicis employees were told to return three days per week, and dozens were laid off late last year for violating the policy. But none have pushed the mandate beyond three days in-person. That’s in contrast to big clients including JPMorgan Chase, Google, IBM, Apple, and Uber, which have ordered workers back to the office full time, with some threatening job cuts for non-compliance. Undoubtedly, the aggressive mandate will push some WPP staffers to seek job alternatives that are more flexible—and agencies who promote those policies may reap the rewards. “A-plus talent has choice,” Jared Belsky, CEO of independent media agency Acadia, told ADWEEK. “They want to work where they feel empowered and trusted. It’s hard to say ‘we trust you’ and then say ‘we are checking your badges to make sure you are here four times per week.’” Scott Brandon, CEO at agency Brandon, said that WPP’s policy reflects an old-school approach in an industry that thrives on evolution. “Rigid mandates risk alienating top performers who know their best work isn’t tied to a cubicle,” he said. “The backlash here isn’t surprising—people are looking for agencies that prioritize results and culture over arbitrary rules.” Jeff Levick, CEO of We Are Rosie, a fully remote company which offers brands flexible agency staffing, added that most return to office policies come from the CFO to justify expenses—but that creatives often work best with flexibility. Kandi Gongora, chief transformation and people officer at Goodway Group, added that office mandates will also limit holding companies from being able to hire the best talent across the country. “This ultimately leads to unsatisfied, unproductive employees in search of greater autonomy and far less access to incredible talent that exists outside of geographical barriers,” she said. While there are viable reasons for people to be in the office, agencies should prioritize those most impactful moments for people to come in, whether that’s to meet with clients, brainstorm with their teams, pitch new business, or build camaraderie, said Andrew Graff, CEO of independent agency Allen & Gerritson (A&G). Mandates must also be thought through carefully, particularly for agencies that downsized office space during the pandemic. WPP staffers are already grumbling about where they will work, as available desks and meeting rooms may be at a minimum, according The Drum. These are all kinks WPP will have to work out as it works through the logistics of an office return. Sasha Martens, founder of Sasha the Mensch, an international headhunting firm, believes independents stand to benefit most from WPP’s mandate, as staffers worry other holding companies will follow suit. “You’re more likely going to see some of the bigger companies say four days a week as well. What that does is open the door for more flexible and independent companies,” Martens told ADWEEK. With Omnicom’s takeover of IPG also spooking talent in fear of layoffs and priority changes, independent agencies could have an advantage. Indeed, Belsky said Acadia has “already seen resumes starting to trickle in, and I would predict we see more.” Levick agrees that flexible businesses like its own will benefit, as We Are Rosie has seen an uptick in resumes in response to return-to-office mandates in the past. “We’re entering this new marketplace where people can decide how they want to work, and if they want to go to the office,” he said. Agencies say a return to office will foster the creative alchemy that happens when teams work together in person. But those who are flexible can still come together with intention , without telling employees what to do. A&G redesigned its offices in Boston and Philadelphia with an eye on flexibility and community for that reason, inviting community members to share the space with it. “Your first space is your home. Your second space is the office. And the third space are those places where you gather and be social but still may conduct business,” said CEO Andrew Graff. “For an industry that is about creativity, I would think we could be a little bit more creative on how we think about these policies or mandates.” Agencies are businesses, and real estate is a substantial investment that they must justify. But disengaged talent can be just as costly in terms of lost innovation, diminished morale, and turnover. “The future of our industry isn’t about going back to the way things were—it’s about finding sustainable solutions that support strong outcomes and a workplace that works for everyone, wherever they are,” said Brooks Luquire, CEO at agency Luquire. Though “human interactions breed creativity,” according to Devin Reiter, president at agency Fortnight Collective, and most agencies are looking for some level of return, flexibility is now a big differentiator. “What the industry needs is balance,” said John Geletka, CXO and founder of Gelekta+. “People need to work together, and work hard, but then need the room after long nights of work to get some home-time and take care of their lives.” Study: Ad Agencies’ Return-to-Office Mandates Pose Hiring and Retention Challenges Kyle O’Brien is a staff reporter for Adweek and editor of AgencySpy.
