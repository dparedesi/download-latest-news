Posted on 01/12/2025 8:31:25 AM PST by wildcard_redneck In a stunning reversal, the tech industry—once the unstoppable engine of modern innovation—has laid off over 124,000 workers in 2024 alone. What’s driving this wave of layoffs, and what does it mean for the future of work in one of the world’s most dynamic sectors? The Layoff Landscape In August 2024, Intel sent shockwaves through the market by announcing a 15% reduction in its global workforce—roughly 15,000 jobs. Just days later, Cisco Systems announced plans to lay off 7% of its employees, marking its second round of job cuts this year as the company shifts focus to rapidly growing areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Earlier in February 2024, Cisco laid off more than 4,000 employees. These are not isolated incidents. According to Layoffs.fyi, 384 tech companies have laid off more than 124,000 employees in 2024, adding to the 428,449 tech workers who lost their jobs in 2022 and 2023. While the broader labor market has shown some resilience, the tech sector's cuts are particularly visible due to the sheer scale of these companies. Even a small percentage reduction translates to thousands of lives and families upended. (Excerpt) Read more at forbes.com ...

When a business operates efficiently and the need for workers decreases, then, layoffs will occur. The need for H1Bs should also decrease; layoffs is not the same as replacing regular American workers with H1B workers. Reductions in staffs is a worldwide situation.

(Because Moore’s Law, and the next generation of chips having twice the price performance, your competitor can buy the next gen chips and undercut you on price...*if* even they can break even.) AI is plagiarism in the rear-view mirror, a solution looking for a problem. There are a few coding types which can trivailly be done by AI: but many simply cannot, and coders report increased time by 30% or so, trying to get the prompts “just right” so that the code will do what is actually required, or without hallucinations. But when all the low-hanging fruit is taken, will the lack of demand doom AI because of the costs?

In that time and in my experience with it, what I've found is: AI is excellent at giving you boilerplate code for the more mundane, day-to-day, cookie-cutter things an application needs. These are bits and pieces of code that are common to just about any project you'd work on, and not specific to your business.

In fact, for all of India, more jobs are being created,” Chandok added. There have been reports of the company cutting a small percentage (less than 1 per cent) of jobs across departments globally, based on performance. The company has around 20,000 employees in India, out of a total of 2,28,000 people worldwide. Microsoft’s latest job cuts are lower compared to past downsizing exercises. The company laid off 10,000 employees in early 2023. In January 2024, the company’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap, just three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. The news of job cuts started doing the rounds during the recent two-day visit to India by Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft. Nadella announced his company’s $3 billion investment plans for cloud and AI infrastructure over the next two years. “India is rapidly becoming a leader in AI innovation, unlocking new opportunities across the country,” Nadella had said, adding that the investments in infrastructure and skilling that he announced reaffirmed Microsoft’s commitment to making India AI-first. He said the company aims to build a thriving AI ecosystem in India by supporting the government and industry in fostering AI innovation and enhancing productivity, efficiency, and accessibility. For the same purpose, Microsoft tied up with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) under the IndiaAI Mission and also announced partnerships with companies like RailTel, Apollo Hospitals, Bajaj Finserv, Mahindra Group, and upGrad to accelerate AI-driven transformations in India. “We will continue to use AI to unlock possibilities for the next few decades and ensure that communities across the country have access to the compute they need to prosper in the AI era,” Chandok added. In 2023, not only Microsoft but other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Accenture, and Dell also announced job cuts of 10,000, 27,000, 19,000, and 6,650, respectively.

Title: Amazon Prime will shut down its clothing try-on program

By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Amazon will be winding down its Prime Try Before You Buy program, which let Prime members try on clothes before paying for them, reports The Information. It will shutter on January 31st, according to a banner at the top of the service’s landing page. Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said in a statement emailed to The Verge that the company is discontinuing the service because it only worked for a “limited number of items” and customers have been “increasingly using our new AI-powered features” to decide what to buy. Tagay gave examples like Virtual Try-On AR feature that puts 3D renders of shoes from certain brands on your feet using your smartphone’s camera. She also mentioned the company’s LLM-powered “personalized size recommendations” that tweak size recommendations based on customer reviews. Prime Try Before You Buy launched in 2018 for all Prime subscribers as Amazon Wardrobe before the company later changed its name. Through it, Prime members can order up to six items, try them for seven days, then pay for what works and send back the rest — like a very basic version of Stitch Fix’s curated clothing service. But a big part of that is returns, which is something the company has been trying to cut back on. The discontinuation of Prime Try Before You Buy comes after years of cost-cutting at the company, as CNBC points out. That’s included massive layoffs and shuttering physical stores, as well as scaling back some of its efforts in the grocery industry. Here is the full statement Tagay provided to The Verge: Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we’re phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025. Of course, customers will continue to enjoy fast, free shipping, with easy, free returns on our full apparel selection. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

The service will be discontinued on Jan. 31, according to a notice posted to Amazon's website. The notice then directs users to browse Amazon's fashion homepage. Try Before You Buy is the latest example of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing efforts to rein in costs across the company. Beginning in 2022 and extending throughout 2024, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in the company's history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across the company. It has also shuttered several of its experimental projects, such as a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service, its telehealth offering and a quirky video-calling device for kids. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the move, which was first reported by The Information. "Given the combination of Try Before You Buy only scaling to a limited number of items and customers increasingly using our new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts to make sure they find the right fit, we're phasing out the Try Before You Buy option, effective January 31, 2025," the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. Amazon rolled out the service, which was previously called Prime Wardrobe, in 2017. It was only available to members of Amazon's $139-per-year Prime subscription program, which also includes perks such as speedy shipping and access to streaming services. Users could test out a mix of luxury, staple and Amazon-owned brands, and return whatever they didn't want to keep for free within seven days of receiving the items. The service operated similarly to wardrobe subscription services including Stitch Fix and Rent the Runway, as well as newer entrants such as Urban Outfitters' Nuuly.

Title: Tech unemployment in the US drops to lowest level in more than two years
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3800903/tech-unemployment-in-the-us-drops-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-two-years.html

Tech hiring rose in December, dropping the IT unemployment rate to 2% — its lowest since November 2023, according to an analysis of the latest jobs data published today by the US Bureau of Labor statistics (BLS). The overall national unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, according to the BLS. The tech sector added a net 7,000 jobs, bringing the total core tech workforce to nearly 6.5 million, according to CompTIA, a nonprofit association for the IT industry and workforce. The group found that the unemployment rate last month among tech professionals fell a full half a percent from November. CompTIA And as 2025 gets under wa, IT employment and hiring appears to be on a positive track, according to staffing agencies. According to ManpowerGroup, the net employment outlook for Q1 2025 is 2% higher than it was for the same period last year — 37% this year compared to 35% in early 2024. ManpowerGroup recently published its Q1 2025 report on hiring, which claimed hiring in IT fields will beat all other professions in the US. Still, the firm also predicted employers will pull back on hiring in the months ahead because of “economic uncertainty.” ManpowerGroup “As we move into 2025, we’re seeing stable year-over-year hiring trends, with employers holding onto the talent they have and planning muted hiring for the quarter ahead,” said Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup chair and CEO. Overall, studies by ManpowerGroup, online hiring platform Indeed, and Deloitte Consulting showed that IT hiring will increasingly be based on finding workers with flexible skills that can meet changing demands. In fact, employment within the tech sector encompassing all types of workers declined by 6,117 jobs in December, according to CompTIA’s data. Positions in PC, semiconductor and components manufacturing accounted for the bulk of those cuts. The tech sector employs nearly 5.6 million people, which translates to a percentage decline of 1%. ManpowerGroup “Employers know a skilled and adaptable workforce is key to navigating transformation, and many are prioritizing hiring and retaining people with in-demand flexible skills that can flex to where demand sits,” Prising said. Ger Doyle, ManpowerGroup’s US country manager, said the December BLS jobs report delivered “a strong finish to 2024 and is a promising sign of what’s to come in the new year. However, the labor market may still face challenges until inflation is under more control, which is necessary to prevent slower hiring, layoffs, and reduced job growth. Our real-time data shows that open positions have decreased by 8% month-over-month, but increased by 3% year-over-year.” Overall, job postings have remained steady since November, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting growing demand in digital services, healthcare, and convenience retail, according to ManpowerGroup’s data. The temp job market was also a bright spot, with open job postings reaching their highest levels since September 2023 and new job postings at their peak since March 2022, according to Doyle. “This surge is driven by an increased demand for IT roles as organizations turn to project work to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Doyle said. Kye Mitchell, head of Experis North America — a ManpowerGroup tech recruiting business — said demand increased among tech employers in December, particularly related to the “gig economy.” Uber led the surge in such jobs with a remarkable 4,150% increase in job postings, while Outlier Inc., a platform that connects experts to advance generative AI, saw a 342% rise in demand. “This trend was also evident in the temp job market, where the demand for computer and information research scientists skyrocketed by 2,000% as organizations focused on developing artificial intelligence and machine learning, increasingly relying on temp workers,” Mitchell said. In December, there were 434,415 active tech job postings, including 165,189 newly added (both down from November). Roles in software development, IT project management, cybersecurity, data science, and tech support saw the most activity, according to CompTIA. Top hiring companies included Amazon, Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, GovCIO, Robert Half, Lumen Technologies, and Insight Global. Job postings spanned all career levels: 22% required 0-3 years of experience, 28% wanted 4-7 years, and 16% sought 8+ years, CompTIA’s data showed.

Title: Office vacancies hit a new high in 2024 despite return-to-office push

Despite pressure from the county’s biggest companies to get workers back in the office, the rise of hybrid and remote work has led to record-high vacancies. Office vacancies peaked in the fourth quarter of last year, with 20.4% of office space in the nation’s top 50 metro areas sitting empty, according to the financial services firm Moody’s. For the same quarter a year earlier, the vacancy rate was a bit lower — at 19.6%. “Five years since the adoption of the widespread hybrid and remote working models, a new regime is forming which has led to a permanent reduction in office demand.” Moody’s said in a note last week. The agency noted that newer buildings, designed to enhance in-person collaboration while reducing the need for permanent offices and cubicles, have been more successful. The news follows a growing trend among major companies such as Amazon (AMZN-0.73%), AT&T (T-0.90%), and most recently JPMorgan Chase, all of which have recently ordered employees to return to the office, rolling back flexible hybrid-work policies. Amazon, however, has faced some challenges with this shift. The company originally planned to require all employees to return to the office five days a week starting January 2, 2025. But according to internal communications obtained by Business Insider, some locations are not yet equipped to accommodate the full workforce. When explaining their return-to-office (RTO) mandates, companies tend to say it will boost productivity, improve work culture, and facilitate teamwork. But according to a recent survey, another big reason companies are choosing to make workers return to the office is because they’re tired of paying for empty office space. Resume.org asked 900 business leaders to tell them about their remote work policies. One in three reported that they were implementing RTO policies because of existing office lease agreements. Some experts, however, have characterized RTO mandates as a method of reducing headcount while avoiding the costs associated with layoffs. - Ben Kesslen contributed to this report.

Title: Disruption Machine: How AI Is Reshaping Economies And Empires
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/amirhusain/2025/01/10/disruption-machine-how-ai-is-reshaping-economies-and-empires/

How AI is reshaping economies The global labor market is on the brink of a seismic shift, driven by the forces of artificial intelligence, automation and offshoring. Layoffs in bellwether sectors like technology, finance and manufacturing are already making headlines. Companies like Meta, Amazon and Google have shed tens of thousands of jobs, citing a need to streamline operations and improve productivity. Meanwhile, the remote work revolution has enabled offshoring at unprecedented scales, allowing businesses to tap into skilled labor markets in countries like India, the Philippines and Eastern Europe at a fraction of the cost. This disruption is exacerbating trends of worker disaffection and economic disparity. According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the middle class—once the backbone of the American economy—continues to shrink. Many of those displaced are unable to transition into new roles, either due to skill mismatches or the sheer pace of technological change. For example, the rise of generative AI has made many content creation and programming jobs redundant, while autonomous systems are replacing roles in logistics, transportation and customer service. The consequences of these disruptions are already playing out politically. Displaced workers and economically insecure populations are gravitating toward populist movements, which promise protectionism, anti-globalization policies and curbs on immigration. In the United States, Europe and beyond, political polarization is deepening, fueled by economic resentment and a perception that governments and corporations prioritize profits over people. If current trends persist, this discontent will only intensify, threatening societal cohesion and democratic stability. But why and how do I say this? What is the basis for such a prediction and what exactly are the specific outcomes we can expect? As research for my upcoming book, “The Cybernetic Society,” I spent years studying trends and building a predictive model of the future based on what I observed. To do this, I used three principal scaffoldings and areas of study to develop an integrated framework that can process the data and deliver likely contours of what we can expect from the future, barring asteroid hits or unexpectedly rapid changes in trajectory. What are these frameworks and areas of study? The first is comprised of Moore’s Law and similar expositions of the exponential progress of technology. Moore’s Law applies to semiconductors specifically, but similar laws, such as Metcalfe’s Law regarding the value of networks, are broadly applicable to many other areas of tech. The progress we’re seeing in CPUs, for example, is also being seen in solar power as efficiency takes off and costs plummet. The second predictive framework is provided by Cliodynamics, a theory of societal cycles and a study of the key drivers of their peaks and troughs. The third framework is the laws of scale as chronicled and studied by Geoffrey West. Exponential growth laws, such as Moore’s Law, have historically guided our understanding of technological progress. Moore’s Law—predicting that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years—symbolizes the broader trend of accelerating innovation. Today, AI systems, robotics and computational power are advancing at rates that outpace traditional economic and educational systems. Exponential growth implies that the disruptive potential of these technologies is not linear but compounding, leading to unpredictable consequences in shorter timeframes. Peter Turchin’s cliodynamics provides a framework for understanding societal cycles through quantitative modeling of historical data. Turchin predicts periodic waves of social unrest, often driven by economic inequality, elite overproduction and declining societal trust. His models suggest that the United States is entering a “disintegrative phase,” characterized by declining living standards and increased political instability. The rapid erosion of secure employment and wage stagnation due to AI and offshoring align with Turchin’s predictions of systemic upheaval. Geoffrey West’s research on scaling laws in cities offers a lens through which to examine the economic and social stability of urban centers. Cities, according to West, are engines of innovation and productivity, but their sustainability hinges on maintaining certain thresholds of employment and income. Below these thresholds, cities risk rapid collapse. West’s models imply that mass unemployment driven by AI and automation could undermine the very fabric of urban economies, leading to cascading failures in infrastructure, governance and societal order. So, when you combine these frameworks and use them to process the data we now have on societal trust, employment, technological advancement and other related areas, what can we say about the future? Quite a lot, actually. In the immediate future, layoffs and job displacement will accelerate. AI’s integration into white-collar professions will render many mid-level roles obsolete, from legal assistants to financial analysts. Companies will prioritize cost-cutting, leveraging remote work and offshoring to access cheaper labor pools. Political disagreements will deepen as displaced workers demand government intervention, while populist leaders capitalize on growing discontent. Social safety nets will be stretched thin. Existing retraining programs will prove inadequate, and structural unemployment will rise. Wealth inequality will grow as the owners of capital—those who control AI —amass disproportionate gains. Simultaneously, consumer demand may weaken, creating deflationary pressures and stagnating economic growth. Over the next decade, structural unemployment will become entrenched. Entire sectors, such as logistics, retail and basic programming, will be dominated by autonomous systems. Even creative fields, once thought immune to automation, will face disruption as generative AI tools become more sophisticated. The middle class will shrink further, leading to a bifurcated society of high-skill, high-income workers and low-skill, low-income laborers. Urban centers in high-income countries may experience rapid decay, particularly those reliant on industries susceptible to automation. Cities that fail to attract high-tech industries or adapt to new economic realities will face population decline and infrastructure degradation. Social unrest will become more frequent, with mass protests and political instability becoming the norm in affected regions. Well before the mid-21st century, technological unemployment could reach unprecedented levels. Governments will face pressure to implement radical policy interventions, such as universal basic income (UBI) or wealth redistribution measures. However, these policies will face resistance from entrenched elites and politically divided societies. Global power dynamics will shift as emerging economies leverage AI and offshoring to ascend economically. High-income countries that fail to adapt to these shifts may experience relative decline. Meanwhile, ethical dilemmas surrounding AI governance and the tremendous power wielded by Big Tech and a few tech billionaires will come to the forefront. All these elements risk exacerbating inequality and societal fragmentation. In this period, the West in particular, may transition into a “post-work” economy, where AI and automation handle most productive activities. In theory, this could lead to unprecedented prosperity, achieving it will require significant cultural, political and economic adaptation. Without effective governance, the future could resemble a dystopia of extreme inequality and widespread disenfranchisement rather than a utopia of shared abundance. There is also the issue of human purpose; as they say, “an idle mind is the devil’s playground.” The coming decades will test our ability to adapt to profound technological and societal changes. While the challenges are immense, so too are the opportunities to reimagine our economic and social systems. Whether we emerge stronger or fractured will depend on how we react; do we collaborate internationally or vent our anger in the form of wars? Do we begin to live within our means or resent any adjustments that will restore budgetary space for developmental activities? Do we continue to look at our global future only through the lens of security interests and military interventions or do we redirect those trillions to education, health and social progress? Our collective choices in the face of these disruptions will deliver to us the future we deserve. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Hold cos to falter and the rise of transmedia: six predictions for the year ahead

January 10, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min What does 2025 hold? Wes Morton at Creativ Strategies shares his thoughts on the trends set to shape the coming months – and reviews his predictions for last year. The year ahead will likely have plenty of ups and downs / Sam via Unsplash An expansive wave of change driven by novel AI tech, shifting media consumption, and continued advertising business transformations looks set to make 2025 one of the most turbulent years ever for our industry. Here are the seven advertising trends that I believe will impact our industry the most in the year ahead. Buckle up, adland. Global ad agency holding companies continue to bleed. IPG and Omnicom announced their mega-merger last month to make the biggest advertising agency holding company in the world, with revenues exceeding $25 billion annually. Meta makes that revenue in two months. Google in one. Meanwhile, more and more independent agencies have emerged offering brands lower cost, broader offerings, and more innovative solutions. The double whammy of independent agencies and big tech’s dominance has forced holding companies to merge to realize cost savings. This won’t stop the bleeding. We predict independent agencies and big tech will continue to take market share from legacy hold cos. The traditional cable bundle has all but unraveled with live sports contracts expiring and going to streaming services. WarnerBros Discovery announced a restructure to split its traditional TV and streaming divisions on December 12th. Comcast announced it’s spinning its own cable division off in 2025. Expect other media conglomerates like Disney and Fox to follow suit in 2025. Legacy cable and media assets still command impressive cashflows. They’ll be sold for a discount to private equity firms, who will collect payments for a long time yet. The leaner digital TV-led companies will command higher multiples and become de facto TV. Broadcast channels like ABC, NBC, and CBS will be retained by original holders. Google has lost three consecutive antitrust cases. Expect more lawsuits against big tech as their market power continues to be put on display. We could see a company like Apple or Nvidia face antitrust scrutiny for app store and semiconductor monopolies. A stat for consideration: Big tech companies now receive more than two-thirds of all advertising dollars. That’s 66 cents of every ad dollar going to just five firms: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon, and 34 cents for everyone else. Antitrust is good for our industry. The entertainment industry and media will finally recognize that video games are the dominant form of entertainment in 2025. They’ve already surpassed movies, TV, and music combined in terms of revenue. This realization has dressed an old concept in new clothes: Transmedia. Transmedia, the porting of intellectual property (IP) from one medium to another, will dominate how media companies and creators think of content moving forward. Video game characters are becoming great TV and movies. Literary and movie characters have become great video games. I predict this will be the buzzword we’re all tired of by the end of 2025. Last year’s layoffs included thousands of employees dedicated to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. These groups of employees were cost centers for businesses and not tied to revenue, making them one of the first groups to receive layoffs. My cynical mind thinks major corporations didn’t care about diversity in the first place. If they did, they would have employed diverse professions in actual positions of authority, not create DEI offices to virtue signal their commitment to social good. There are promising stats that companies are still hiring diverse talent, but don’t expect corporate America to be as vocal under a Trump administration sworn to dismantle DEI efforts. Despite the hyperbolic rhetoric in 2024 of generalized AI, more and more practical applications of AI will appear in 2025. Our firm is reinventing market research using LLMs to pull and cluster massive quantities of online opinion data. More transformative AI products will emerge in 2025. These will include illustration software to complete animation between key frames; applications for rendering faster and more intricate visual effects; other research solutions to process mass data; creative production software, such as multiple asset generation from a core asset or guidelines; code generation to fix or fill in missing code; and, ironically, AI to discern if an image or video has been produced by a human or machine. Here are my predictions for 2024 – some that came true, and some that are still developing. Have you heard of the Metaverse at all this year? We’ve not. And we predicted this term would die in 2024, along with the venture-backed companies that bet on it. Still working hybrid? You bet. We said businesses would concede and give up getting people back five days in the office. The majority of white-collar professionals continue to work hybrid hours. The most common is three days a week in the office. We predicted antitrust lawsuits would continue to bash big tech in 2024. We were correct and lawyers will continue to get paid into 2025. We said media conglomerates would split their legacy cable and streaming assets up. It took longer than anticipated but… see above. And finally, are you watching or listening to more foreign-made shows? We predicted this too. Foreign shows have more novel storylines, the global media industries are maturing – especially in Korea, India, and Nigeria – and foreign productions are cheaper to produce than in America, making them prime licensing material. Anyone else enjoying Squid Games 2? Never forget: where there’s chaos, there’s also opportunity. The volatility of new technologies, media models, and business transformations should breed new winners. Time to place your bets for 2025.

These will include illustration software to complete animation between key frames; applications for rendering faster and more intricate visual effects; other research solutions to process mass data; creative production software, such as multiple asset generation from a core asset or guidelines; code generation to fix or fill in missing code; and, ironically, AI to discern if an image or video has been produced by a human or machine. Here are my predictions for 2024 – some that came true, and some that are still developing. Have you heard of the Metaverse at all this year? We’ve not. And we predicted this term would die in 2024, along with the venture-backed companies that bet on it. Still working hybrid? You bet. We said businesses would concede and give up getting people back five days in the office. The majority of white-collar professionals continue to work hybrid hours. The most common is three days a week in the office. We predicted antitrust lawsuits would continue to bash big tech in 2024. We were correct and lawyers will continue to get paid into 2025. We said media conglomerates would split their legacy cable and streaming assets up. It took longer than anticipated but… see above. And finally, are you watching or listening to more foreign-made shows? We predicted this too. Foreign shows have more novel storylines, the global media industries are maturing – especially in Korea, India, and Nigeria – and foreign productions are cheaper to produce than in America, making them prime licensing material. Anyone else enjoying Squid Games 2? Never forget: where there’s chaos, there’s also opportunity. The volatility of new technologies, media models, and business transformations should breed new winners. Time to place your bets for 2025.

The Washington Post announced layoffs affecting fewer than 100 employees in sales, marketing and IT teams due to financial losses and declining digital readership. The newspaper reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. Its digital subscriber base has decreased from 3 million in 2020 to 2.5 million, and monthly unique visitors to its website have dropped from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. The newsroom, which previously underwent significant cuts in 2021, will not be directly impacted by the latest round of layoffs, highlighting the paper's ongoing transformation to meet industry needs. Controversy surrounding the newspaper's endorsement policies, specifically ownerÂ Jeff Bezos' decision to block the editorial board from endorsing outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, has led to a mass exodus of subscribers and staff members, with up to 250,000 subscribers canceling memberships in protest. Prominent journalists, including columnists and political reporters, have left the paper in recent months, further exacerbating the situation and raising concerns about the newspaper's ability to maintain editorial independence.

Prominent journalists, including columnists and political reporters, have left the paper in recent months, further exacerbating the situation and raising concerns about the newspaper's ability to maintain editorial independence. The Washington Post has announced that it would lay off approximately four percent of its workforce due to significant financial losses and declining digital readership. The layoffs, which will affect fewer than 100 employees, will affect sales, marketing and information technology teams. The newsroom, which underwent significant cuts in 2021 with the elimination of 240 jobs, will not be directly impacted by this round of layoffs. (Related: Mass layoffs incoming: 50% of employers plan to cut jobs in the next 12 months.) The newspaper, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reported a $77 million loss in 2023, with a substantial decline in its digital subscriber base since 2020. The Poynter also revealed that the news outlet has seen a 14 percent decline in digital revenue and a 12 percent drop in total revenue since 2021. The publication's digital subscriber base, which peaked at three million in 2020, now stands at 2.5 million. Monthly unique visitors to the newspaper's website have also plummeted, from 101 million in 2020 to 50 million in 2023. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are," the statement read. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position the Post for the future." The latest round of layoffs is part of a larger trend affecting the news industry, which has struggled to adapt to the shift toward digital consumption and the decline in print advertising revenue. As newspapers and other media outlets continue to grapple with these challenges, the Post's cuts serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing transformation of the industry. Mass exodus of subscribers and staff members These financial challenges come against a backdrop of increasing alienation between the newsroom and Bezos and publisher Will Lewis. Moreover, Bezos sparked a firestorm of controversy and outrage byÂ blocking the editorial board from endorsing Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. In the aftermath of Bezos' decision, it is estimated that as many as 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships in protest. Additionally, two prominent columnists, Michele Norris and Robert Kagan, have resigned from the newspaper in protest, while two other editorial board members, Molly Roberts and David Hoffman, have stepped down from their positions. Adding to the turmoil, two of the Post's top political reporters, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, have been lured away by The Atlantic, which is owned by a group funded by billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs. Another highly valued investigative reporter, Josh Dawsey, is set to join the Wall Street Journal, while White House correspondent Tyler Pager is reportedly considering his options or has already decided to leave. The departure of these journalists has been accompanied by a broader restructuring of the newsroom under the leadership of the head of newsroom operations, James Lewis. In a further blow to the newspaper's credibility, Ann Telnaes, a longtime cartoonist, announced her resignation in protest over the decision to spike an illustration that mocked Bezos as subservient to President-elect Donald Trump. This move has only added to the perception that the newspaper is no longer able to maintain its editorial independence. Learn more about the unraveling of the American economy at Collapse.news.

Title: Microsoft reveals another round of job cuts

Microsoft cuts more jobs, this time apparently based on performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The technology industry is still grappling with ongoing financial challenges leading to widespread job losses, with Microsoft the latest to be affected. Having already got rid of 10,000 workers (or around 5% of its headcount) at the height of the layoffs in January 2023, Microsoft went on to lay off at least another 2,500 of its employees in June 2024. Now, just a week into 2025, the company has confirmed further reductions, affecting less than 1% of its workforce, which stood at 228,000 employees six months ago. “At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent… We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action,” the company confirmed in an email to CNBC, indicating the redundancies could be part of a regular restructuring effort rather than a reaction to financial performance. However, despite posting a revenue increase of 12% in its most recent quarter, around one percentage point ahead of key hyperscaler rivals Amazon and Google, Microsoft share prices didn’t quite please investors. Over the past 12 months, Microsoft shares have risen 12.98%, compared with 37.06% for Google and a staggering 46.75% for Amazon. Share prices don’t paint a full picture of the company’s performance though – it has the largest market cap of the three hyperscalers by far, at $3.156 trillion, compared with $2.382 for Google and $2.335 for Amazon.

Title: Washington Post ‘rudderless’ as Bezos’ paper engulfed by layoffs, talent exodus ahead of Trump’s second term

The new year has already become a rough one for The Washington Post as its years-long identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency. While newsroom tensions and money woes have been persistent, they were taken to new heights following Bezos’ appointment of Will Lewis as The Post’s publisher and CEO. Tasked to revitalize the paper’s cratering business model, Lewis had some choice words for his staff in a June 2024 meeting following the ousting of its executive editor Sally Buzbee. “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff … I can’t sugarcoat it anymore,” Lewis said at the time. Fast-forward to 2025, and Lewis has alienated himself from his newsroom. “The company feels rudderless right now,” one staffer told Fox News Digital. “Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous ‘no one’s reading your stuff’ meeting from last year, he hasn’t named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn’t communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed.” The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck’s Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital “that’s apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff.” “In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once — in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate,” the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis’ blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos’ decision to halt The Post’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn’t even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos’ decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos’ move the “single most disastrous” management decision in the paper’s history. “The morale is very low, of course,” Farhi told Fox News Digital. “Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But it strikes me that they’ve made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse.” Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks “with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding,” current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post’s health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a “vote of no confidence” in publisher Will Lewis. “These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper,” he said. “You know, politics isn’t the only thing the Washington Post does, but it’s a big part of the franchise. And when you’re losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you’ve developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it’s really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they’ll hire back. They’ll find people. Will they be as good? That’s a big question.” What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor’s Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were “sold” on the idea that The Post’s mission was to be a “#Resistance newspaper.” However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. “Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose,” the Amazon founder wrote in October. “Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility.” Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an “unprecedented behind-the-scenes look” at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. The Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump’s feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post’s in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn’t cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes’ resignation. “I couldn’t possibly dissent more strongly from that policy,” Wemple reacted on Monday. “The Post’s willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it’s something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated.” In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren’t looking to leave. “I’d like to try to ride it through,” one said. “I love the company, love the people I work with and for.” The staffer urged Lewis to “treat his employees like adults.” “Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent,” they said. One former staffer slammed the “self-inflicted” damage being done by their once-beloved employer. “It’s very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled,” the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting “neither is willing to take a stand” against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray’s new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. “It’s truly tragic,” they said. The Washington Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News’ David Rutz contributed to this report. Advertisement

Fox News' Howard Kurtz joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Jeff Bezos' decision to not have The Washington Post endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. 2025 has already become a rough year for The Washington Post as its yearslong identity crisis and financial struggles continue to plague the Jeff Bezos-owned paper ahead of the second Trump presidency.

"Will Lewis has basically disappeared since his infamous 'no one's reading your stuff' meeting from last year, he hasn't named a permanent executive editor, if he has a business plan, he hasn't communicated it to his employees, or the public, or to anyone, it seems, except [Puck reporter] Dylan Byers… with no clarity on when and in what direction the company is headed." The staffer fumed while speculating that Lewis had been the source of the reporting of Puck's Dylan Byers, telling Fox News Digital "that's apparently how Lewis prefers to communicate with his staff." "In the last six months, maybe more, we have heard from Will Lewis exactly once -- in his bizarrely passive-aggressive email after the election announcing the return to office mandate," the staffer said. Last summer, Lewis appointed former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray as acting executive editor until a permanent replacement for Buzbee was found. But an exhaustive search has resulted in no one taking the position, leaving Lewis to appoint Murray as the new permanent executive editor, according to a recent report from Byers. Lewis' blunt comments may have irked his staff, but Bezos' decision to halt The Post's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election sparked a firestorm not just in the newsroom but among readers as well. The Post was already on pace to lose a staggering $77 million by the end of the year, but that hit doesn't even account for the whopping 250,000 people who reportedly canceled their subscriptions as a result of the non-endorsement. WAPO STAFFER UNSURE PAPER CAN RECOVER AS BEZOS-OWNED OUTLET SHEDS 250,000 SUBSCRIBERS OVER ENDORSEMENT FIASCO Many critics, both inside and outside of the paper, interpreted Bezos' decision as appeasement to then-candidate and now-President-elect Donald Trump. Paul Farhi, a former media writer for The Washington Post who left in 2023 as a result of company-wide mass buyouts, called Bezos' move the "single most disastrous" management decision in the paper's history. "The morale is very low, of course," Farhi told Fox News Digital. "Things would be not great if the paper had management that had made all the right moves. But it strikes me that they've made a series of terrible moves in response to deteriorating, larger economic conditions, which have made things a lot worse." The decision by billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos to quash the endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was called the "single most disastrous move" by management in the paper's history. ((Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage) ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) Posties remain alarmed by the exodus of talent in recent weeks "with no apparent effort to stop the bleeding," current staffers have said. The non-endorsement led to the resignations of editor-at-large Robert Kagan and multiple editorial board members. In the weeks since, several high-profile staffers have announced departures for other outlets, including reporters Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Tyler Page and LeeAnn Caldwell, columnist Charles Lane and veteran editor Matea Gold. Fox News Digital also learned that The Post's health and science editor Stephen Smith is leaving for The New York Times. Farhi called the departures a "vote of no confidence" in publisher Will Lewis. "These departures are in reflection a vote of no confidence in him and the management of the paper," he said. "You know, politics isn't the only thing the Washington Post does, but it's a big part of the franchise. And when you're losing the core, you know, some of the best people who you've developed over the years to be the part of that franchise, it's really demoralizing and really undermines the overall enterprise. You know, they'll hire back. They'll find people. Will they be as good? That's a big question." WASHINGTON POST IN ‘DISARRAY’ AFTER CARTOONIST QUITS, STAFF EXODUS What could also be fueling the exits is the ideological battle that appears to be taking shape inside The Post. As Semafor's Ben Smith recently wrote, many employees were "sold" on the idea that The Post's mission was to be a "#Resistance newspaper." However, Bezos himself alluded to making reforms at the paper in an op-ed defending his endorsement decision. "Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose," the Amazon founder wrote in October. "Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility." Bezos, like several billionaires in Silicon Valley, has extended olive branches to President-elect Trump since his victory. Bezos met with him at Mar-a-Lago last month and donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. Amazon Prime also announced this week it will be producing a documentary giving an "unprecedented behind-the-scenes look" at First Lady Melania Trump, which will be released globally both in theaters and in streaming. Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after the paper refused to publish an illustration mocking its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. (Screenshot/CNN/AnnTelnaes) The Post's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes mocked Bezos depicting him and others groveling at Trump's feet in a cartoon that editors refused to publish. She resigned in protest last week. The Washington Post's in-house media critic Erik Wemple spoke out against a new policy implemented by Murray, who said the paper shouldn't cover itself when asked about the lack of coverage of Telnaes' resignation. "I couldn't possibly dissent more strongly from that policy," Wemple reacted on Monday. "The Post's willingness over the years to cover its slip-ups and scandals has helped to set it apart from the many news organizations that refuse to hold themselves to the same rules to which they hold politicians, CEOs, professional athletes, etc. And it's something, I believe, that subscribers have appreciated." In addition to the recent newsroom drama, The Washington Post implemented layoffs this week, impacting about 4% of the entire company, targeting its business divisions while its journalists were spared. Despite their personal dismay at the current state of the paper, two Posties tell Fox News Digital they aren't looking to leave. "I'd like to try to ride it through," one said. "I love the company, love the people I work with and for." WAPO WRITER REBUKES NEW POLICY ON PAPER NOT COVERING ITSELF: ‘I COULDN’T POSSIBLY DISSENT MORE STRONGLY' Washington Post acting executive editor Matt Murray said he implemented a new "policy" that the paper should not cover itself. (Robert Miller/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The staffer urged Lewis to "treat his employees like adults." "Tell us his vision for the company, explain his path for us to get there, and hire a talented and inspirational executive editor to take us there. Do your job. Stop letting the company drift into obsolescence and stem the bleeding of talent," they said. One former staffer slammed the "self-inflicted" damage being done by their once-beloved employer. "It's very sad to see how quickly everything that was built has been dismantled," the veteran ex-Postie said. The former staffer called out Lewis and Murray, insisting "neither is willing to take a stand" against Bezos. They took a swipe at Murray's new policy on Post journalists not covering itself, predicting the policy will soon apply to not covering Amazon as well. "It's truly tragic," they said.

Title: What to know about Microsoft Azure, the cloud computing platform and computing, networking, and storage services
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-azure
Time Published: 2025-01-09T03:14:02Z
Full Content:
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers a range of cloud-based computing, networking, and data storage services. Microsoft Azure boasts "solutions that enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers." Crystal clear, right? Don't worry, we'll break it down for you, but first just to clarify, Azure is indeed a computing platform, not just a storage platform. In short, Azure lets you do things that require much more processing power than your computer has because the computing is done far from your desk, couch, or that coffee shop table. Now for the longer view. The same company that brought you PowerPoint, Word, and more, launched Azure as Windows Azure back in 2010, rebranding it to Microsoft Azure in 2014. With the launch of the company's AI interface Copilot in 2023, using Azure became easier than ever, as the smart chat interface can help less tech-savvy users take advantage of Azure's many uses. Azure is now used by a plethora of small and large businesses and organizations. Indeed, Azure has become such a valuable platform and suite of services that Microsoft offers certifications in dozens of different Azure features and softwares to help IT professionals, developers, and engineers learn the intricacies. Azure has become a critical component of Microsoft's business model since its 2010 launch, with executives often boasting of Azure's revenues in earnings calls. However, Azure has not been immune from the turbulence within the tech industry in the post-pandemic era. Large rounds of Microsoft layoffs tend to be a "when" and not an "if" sort of thing, so it was hardly a great shock when hundreds of Azure employees were laid off in early summer 2024. The large round of job cuts specifically targeted workers in the Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering departments, and were part of a pattern of layoffs begun in 2023 and expanded in 2024. Azure allows you to use an already immense and ever-growing catalog of services; it would be way too heavy of a lift to cover them all here, so we will showcase a few of the things you can do via this cloud computing platform. Azure AI Search: This service allows you to conduct advanced, tailored smart searches and build up a vectored database of relevant retrieved information. Azure Open Datasets: Host and share curated datasets that are honed and refined through machine learning, growing more accurate over time. Speaker Recognition: This service allows for the ever-improving recognition of speech and integrates spoken words into programming, documents, and more. It is multilingual, of course. Azure AI Content Safety: Azure can automatically watch out for images, text, and video content that might be inappropriate — or simply irrelevant — and filter them out of your content. Most Azure products use a pay-as-you-go model rather than fixed rates for different products or a flat monthly fee. Your costs could be as low as pennies each month for basic cloud storage or the managed hosting of a simple website or well into the thousands of dollars for enterprise-level use of myriad AI-enabled products. Many Azure products can also be used for free. New users can enjoy 25 services free for 12 months, while others remain free at all times to all people. These include API management, the Azure AI Bot Service, and the Azure AI Metrics Advisor, to name just a few. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the heavy hitter in cloud computing and storage, arguably leading the way in networking, cloud storage, mobile development, and cybersecurity. Google Cloud Platform GCP is big on data analysis and arguably allows the easiest user experience and more seamless interaction with products created by other brands. Microsoft Azure, for its part, provides vastly scalable and efficient software products, and it's usually cheaper than Google Cloud or AWS. Jump to

Title: A Lesson in Creativity and Capitalism from Two Zany YouTubers
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/a-lesson-in-creativity-and-capitalism-from-two-zany-youtubers
Time Published: 2025-01-08T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
For this week’s Infinite Scroll column, Cal Newport is filling in for Kyle Chayka. James Hobson began publishing videos on YouTube in 2006, when he was still a high-school student in Ontario, Canada. His early uploads were crude by today’s standards—some gymnastics tricks, some parkour, and some mildly anarchic silliness (for example, a 2009 clip of Hobson drinking raw eggs). “It was just the easiest way of sharing videos with my friends,” Hobson told me recently. “I would upload on YouTube and then share a link using MSN messenger.” Hobson’s relationship with YouTube began to evolve in 2013, when he crafted a pair of metal claws to help him dress up as Wolverine, the Marvel superhero, for Halloween. The resulting video, which he titled “Make It Real: The Wolverine’s Claws!,” was so popular that photographers asked him to star in photo shoots; a follow-up video in which he electrified the claws earned him a writeup in a tech publication. “That’s kind of cool,” Hobson remembers thinking. A year later, another installment of “Make It Real” showed him building a mechanical exoskeleton of the kind used in “Elysium,” a science-fiction film starring Matt Damon, out of perforated square tubing and compact hydraulic actuators. The exoskeleton attracted even more viewers than the Wolverine claws, and Hobson—a systems mechanical engineer—began to reconsider his line of work. In 2015, Hobson quit his job to become a professional YouTuber, funding the transition by taking money out of his fledgling retirement account and selling laser-engraved goods on Etsy. “I had, like, six months to make it happen,” he recalled. Fortunately for him, his next project, a real-life version of Captain America’s electromagnetic shield, drew millions of views and pushed his subscriber count past five hundred thousand. He began attracting sponsorships and soon was earning enough sponsorships to make his channel financially stable. Hobson then followed a well-worn playbook in the world of creative capitalism, one deployed by numerous startups and scrappy media companies: get as large as you can as fast as you can. “Once we started growing, I was, like, ‘I want a really big property. I want a warehouse and outdoor space and room to do really big projects,’ ” Hobson told me. When he quit his job, he’d been making videos in his garage, but by 2019 he was leasing a thirteen-thousand-square-foot warehouse. In the twenty-twenties, he took out a multimillion-dollar mortgage on an even bigger warehouse, surrounded by forests, ponds, and fields—in his words, “a perfect backdrop for filming.” Hobson, known online as the Hacksmith, called the new location HERC, for Hacksmith Engineering Research Campus. He said it was loosely modelled on the headquarters of Stark Industries in Marvel’s “Iron Man” series. His staff grew to thirty people. At first, the expansion of Hobson’s business kept pace with his ambitions. “We doubled in size year over year,” he told me. “It was pretty darn exponential.” But, when subscriber growth slowed, HERC’s operating costs remained high. Two rounds of layoffs followed, and the company managed to stave off bankruptcy in large part because its online shop, Hacksmith.store, was unexpectedly successful. The classic strategy of scaling up left Hobson disillusioned. When I talked to him, he said that, as the head of a large, chronically cash-strapped organization, he was stressed out and nostalgic for the days when he could obsess over a single project. “Making videos has become a lot less fun for me,” he told me. Colin Furze, a former plumber whose YouTube channel has more than thirteen million subscribers, is like Hobson’s British doppelgänger; their career paths are a study in contrasts. When we spoke, Furze had recently posted a video titled “Digging A SECRET GARAGE Part 4 Digging Done!,” which showed him at home in a suburb of Stamford, England, pouring concrete in a large, subterranean garage that he was excavating in his front yard. Furze plans to store his vintage DeLorean there; he will summon it to the surface with a hidden elevator fit for the Batcave. The video has been viewed more than five million times. Furze, like Hobson, began publishing videos on YouTube in the early days after the platform’s launch. Initially, he filmed BMX tricks, but as he got older he gained showmanship; in one video, he modified a towed van so that he could serve meals to people in other cars while driving. An early hit came when, for reasons he cannot fully reconstruct, he decided to build the world’s largest bonfire. “I collected pallets for over a year,” he told me. A short video clip of the feat attracted hundreds of thousands of views. (At the time, YouTube did not accept uploads of large files.) In 2010, Furze broke another record on camera when he accelerated a supercharged mobility scooter to more than seventy miles per hour. He was later invited to ride it onto the stage of “Good News,” a TV show, but a crucial cable snapped during filming, forcing him to improvise a conversation with the host from backstage as he frantically made the repair. An employee of Sky, the British broadcaster, was impressed by Furze’s banter and brought him to London to audition for a co-host’s job on a new program called “Gadget Geeks.” He landed the role. While building zany contraptions for the show, Furze learned the importance of onscreen charisma and projects that were over the top—what the producers called “TV big.” After the season completed filming, in 2011, he kept building gadgets for his personal YouTube channel. His video of the “world’s fastest” stroller has attracted seven million views. He has so far earned nearly double that audience for a follow-up project in which he attached a jet engine to a bicycle. (The video’s description read, “Why not put a massive pulse jet on the most rubbish bike to hand seems a cracking idea to me HAHAHA.”) Furze, like Hobson, suddenly had sponsors eager to fund his work. He could now make a living on YouTube. Here, Furze’s path diverges from Hobson’s, creating a sort of natural experiment with an unexpected result. Hobson parlayed his early success into rapid growth, with his budget soon ballooning to a quarter of a million dollars a month. Furze, by contrast, continued to conceive, film, and edit his videos almost entirely on his own, with his modest budget almost exclusively dedicated to the materials needed for his projects. His wife sometimes held a camera, and his friend Rick sometimes lent a hand with builds, but Furze did not hire any formal staff and worked primarily in a back-yard workshop and an old barn. (Hobson, who knows Furze, told me that he was shocked to learn that the barn, which gets very hot in the summer, isn’t even air-conditioned.) In 2024, Hobson and his team published twenty-five videos that have attracted more than twenty-seven million total views. In the same period, Furze’s five videos, which he produced more or less by himself, have earned eighteen million total views. In addition to this content on his main channel, Furze also posted behind-the-scenes footage of his subterranean-garage project on a second channel called 2 Much ColinFurze. “Everybody went absolutely nuts for it,” he told me. These additional videos bring his total views in 2024 to forty-three million—much higher than Hobson’s number, generated with a fraction of the stress and expense. For these two exercises in creative capitalism, bigger investment didn’t lead to better results. I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

I asked Hobson and Furze what they thought was going on, and they both highlighted an unusual feature of media platforms on the Internet: the personal connection that creators establish with viewers. “When it was just out of my garage—even though it was a really nice garage—the content was a lot more relatable,” Hobson said. “People become such earnest fans, because they know you and are watching for you. Just because you can do a higher-production-value thing doesn’t mean you’ll succeed.” In this context, a low-tech setup can come across as more authentic. “How people describe the channel is that it’s like you’re in the shed with me,” Furze told me. “As soon as someone was with me, and the camera was moving . . . they knew it wasn’t just me.” (Some fans tell Furze that they’ve been watching him since they were kids, which, he said, makes him feel old.) When Hobson scales up a project, his audience often grows, too—but not enough. “Our really big, out-there projects typically work,” he said. For one recent video, his team spent more than a year recreating a bulletproof suit worn by Keanu Reeves in several “John Wick” movies. It has generated more than twenty-three million views. Hobson can star in only so many videos, however. “I can’t create enough of those to cover our base expenses,” he said. “Unless I have a bunch of these queued up—which I don’t—it’s not really sustainable.” Furze, by contrast, sometimes strategically keeps his projects modest. “Some of my best performing ideas have been the stupid, silliest ideas that have cost virtually nothing,” he said. He spent a couple of hundred dollars on making a life-size concrete Weeble, a toy that wobbles on a rounded, bottom-heavy base without falling over; a V.P.N. provider signed on as a sponsor and the video racked up ten million views. “If you can nail that every week or month, then you’re absolutely laughing,” Furze told me. Furze’s solo success is a quirky challenge to the traditional narrative that survival requires continually growing, and that a small number of well-financed winners eventually eat most of the economic pie. He demonstrates that in certain corners of the creative economy an individual with minimal overhead can work on select attention-catching projects and earn a generous upper-middle-class income. Beyond this relatively modest scale of activity, however, the returns on additional investment rapidly diminish. As Hobson’s experience suggests, there’s no obvious path for a D.I.Y. video creator to turn his channel into a multimillion-dollar empire, even if he wants to. Furze seems to be maxing out the financial potential of his medium by staying small. In the context of the media industry as a whole, the low-key success of indie YouTubers is unusual. As entertainment companies compete to amass viewers, budgets have ballooned: TV shows such as “Gotham” (Fox) and “Masters of the Air” (Apple TV+) spend hundreds of millions of dollars in production. One show, “Rings of Power” (Amazon Prime Video), cost a billion. Tellingly, when the all-star YouTuber Mr. Beast moved his online shtick to Amazon Prime, in the form of a ten-episode series called “Beast Games,” the streamer invested a hundred million dollars to produce a TV-worthy product. The movie industry also famously rewards capital-intensive blockbusters. Universal spent a hundred and fifty million just on the marketing for its fall hit, “Wicked.” Even the comparatively staid book-publishing industry relies on major investments in a few mega-best-sellers to achieve profitability. In 2022, reportedly only three hundred and twenty books sold more than fifty thousand copies, the approximate threshold required to earn a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. On certain newer media platforms, however, Furze seems like an archetype rather than an exception. E-mail newsletter writers, podcasters, TikTok influencers, and OnlyFans stars follow similar principles to carve out a good living without the need for endless growth and investment. The fact that these formats rely on the Internet is not coincidental. A key element of their success—their ability to support an intimate connection between creators and a dedicated audience—may be inherently easier to achieve online. It’s this same element that is hard to scale up. It takes a long time to build a loyal audience and a lot of work to maintain it. And, because the Hobsons and Furzes of the world operate in idiosyncratic niches, there’s a limit to the total number of fans they can ultimately attract. Their model is better for builders of secret suburban garages than for old-fashioned entertainment companies seeking enormous profits. These dynamics matter, because they tell us something more general about how the creative economy is evolving. It’s still true that the real money to be made tends to go to a small number of tech companies; YouTube, for example, keeps about half of the ad revenue generated by the videos it hosts. But YouTube’s incentive to continue making money arguably encourages it to keep its service friendly to its most popular users. (Both Hobson and Furze had good things to say about YouTube.) It’s easier to cultivate a thousand Colin Furzes, each with an audience of a million, than to try to attract a billion viewers to a single hit show. All of this seems like good news for fans of a broader creative middle class. It’s still hard to become a successful YouTuber, Substacker, or podcaster, but the barrier to trying is relatively low, and a large number of people can succeed on these relatively modest scales—something that might not be true in the more traditional hit-driven mediums. In our era of consolidation and polarization, many online spaces can seem dreary, toxic, addicting, or some combination of the three. As my colleague Kyle Chayka wrote in 2023, most of the Web just “isn’t fun anymore.” In Furze, however, I sensed some of the optimism of the early Internet. Toward the end of our conversation, I asked him whether he thought his one-man-band model would remain viable in years to come. “I can’t see why not,” he replied. “There will always be a place on the Internet for the lo-fi, garage-bred stuff. People will always want what’s real.” ♦

Title: Mark Zuckerberg unveils his latest persona: Elon Musk

Meta's about-face on fact-checking shows how Musk has remade the world in his image. While Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never did face off in that cage match, "Uncle Elon" has bested Zuck in the political arena, becoming one of the most powerful unelected figures in modern US history. Now, in hopes of forging a friendlier relationship with the Trump administration a second time around, Zuckerberg seems to be following a new mantra: If you can't beat Elon, be him. On Tuesday, Meta announced it would end third-party fact-checking and replace it with a more hands-off content-moderation policy in which users police one another through community notes — just like Musk's X. In a video announcing the changes, Zuckerberg said that "governments and legacy media" had pushed for more censorship in recent years, and that Meta had decided its "complex systems" had "too many mistakes and too much censorship." "The recent elections," the Meta CEO added, "also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech." His language would have sounded natural coming out of the mouth of Musk, who shared Zuckerberg's video on X and dubbed Meta's move "cool." Community notes is only the latest page Zuckerberg has taken from his billionaire rival's playbook. Whether conducting mass layoffs or removing the guardrails to social media or joining forces with Musk against their shared competitor OpenAI or spending time at Mar-a-Lago, Zuckerberg has been following Musk's lead more often. This isn't the first time Zuckerberg, who has helmed Facebook since he was 19, has reinvented himself. From the brash, hoodie-wearing Harvard dropout in Facebook's early days to the suit-wearing, meat-smoking, Silicon Valley nice guy in the years after the company went public to the hardened, martial-arts-practicing "wartime"-mode Zuck who emerged in the wake of the most turbulent period in company history, Zuckerberg has fashioned several personas that approximate what his company most needs him to be at the time. In 2025, don't let his longer hair, oversize T-shirts, and statement jewelry fool you. The persona Mark Zuckerberg has taken on to ensure Meta's success as his historical adversary Donald Trump returns to the White House acts a lot like Donald Trump's right-hand man, Elon Musk. When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he shaved content moderation to bare bones in the name of free speech and cut more than 80% of its staff, sending shockwaves through the tech world. Many speculated that Twitter would crack under the pressure, and die. When, despite some hiccups, the platform continued to function largely as normal, Zuckerberg, like several other tech CEOs, applauded Musk for making Twitter "leaner" (doing so on the Musk superfan Lex Fridman's podcast). Meta also laid off 11,000 workers days after Musk took over Twitter, and Zuckerberg then dubbed 2023 "the year of efficiency" at Meta, cutting another 10,000 people. Zuckerberg now also plans to move trust-and-safety workers from California to Texas, following in step with Musk, who has relocated X from San Francisco to Texas, where he has also located Starlink and The Boring Company. And as Zuckerberg stayed quieter throughout the 2024 presidential election after Meta took heat for misinformation in 2016 and 2020, Musk did the opposite. The world's richest man appeared onstage alongside Trump, backed Trump with more than $250 million, and posted to X incessantly in support of the now president-elect. Musk has again come out on top, as he now sits at the pinnacle of political influence and is poised to radically reshape government spending as he and Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency. Big Tech's other power players who want a favorable relationship with Trump are left to follow in his path. Since November, Apple's Tim Cook, Open AI's Sam Altman, and Amazon have each donated to Trump's inaugural fund. Zuckerberg has done that and more, including visiting Mar-a-Lago to have dinner with the president-elect; naming UFC CEO Dana White, a close Trump ally, to Meta's board; and promoting Joel Kaplan, a longtime Republican lobbyist, to chief global affairs officer. (On Tuesday, Kaplan gave an interview on "Fox & Friends" to promote the company's content-moderation changes.) All of this is meant to quell a once adversarial relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump, who had threatened to imprison Zuckerberg if his social sites interfered with the 2024 election and years ago accused Facebook of being "anti-Trump" and colluding against him (Zuckerberg pushed back against such claims). As my colleague Peter Kafka wrote of the community notes news: "There's no way to see Zuckerberg's moves as anything other than a straightforward attempt to please Trump and the incoming president's conservative allies, who have often complained that Zuckerberg's properties were biased against them." Even Trump said Tuesday that Meta was "probably" responding to his own past threats against Zuck by pivoting. The very fact-checkers who will soon be dismissed by Meta began with a program in December 2016, after Facebook faced harsh criticism for its role in spreading misinformation in Trump's first election a month prior. Meta actively worked to downplay political content following the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and it suspended Trump from Facebook and Instagram (Meta lifted the suspension in early 2023, saying the public should be able to access what politicians are saying; the move came shortly after Musk allowed Trump back on Twitter). When Meta launched Threads, its own Twitter competitor, in 2023, the Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, said the new app would not encourage breaking news and politics posts. But Musk, who has rebuilt X in his own image to favor conservative and far-right accounts, has found that a social-media site can win when embracing the president. On Tuesday, Meta also said it would reverse course and stop downgrading political content, and start phasing politics back into users' feeds. (A Meta spokesperson referred to past public statements but did not provide new comment for this story.) Early research on X's community notes shows the move has led to mixed results when it comes to combating misinformation. But changes at X have certainly proved a mammoth victory for Musk, whose wealth has grown by an estimated $200 billion since the election. As he's molded himself more in Uncle Elon's image, Nephew Zuck may also find himself in Trump's favor. Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

Title: Bezos-owned Washington Post cuts more jobs, reports say

The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses. The cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues. The layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry", a spokesperson for the newspaper said. "Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future." In 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (£45m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. Mr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the "media is biased." Still, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest. Since then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. The apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post. That came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump. Last month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as "an extraordinary political comeback" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The Amazon and Blue Origin founder is one of several tech leaders who has made the trip to Mar-a-Lago. In February, Mr Bezos announced that he would sell shares in technology giant worth around $8.5bn. The firm had previously said its founder would sell up to 50 million shares by the end of January 2025. The multi-billionaire moved to Florida last year, which has no state tax on share sales above $250,000. Two Amazon satellites launch to test the tech for a global broadband system in the sky.
