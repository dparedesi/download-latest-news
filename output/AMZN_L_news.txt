Amazon layoffs: E-commerce giant Amazon is cutting around 100 jobs in its devices and services division, which includers workers involved with the Alexa voice assistance and e-reader product Kindle, according to a report by Bloomberg. This moves comes as the company makes effort to ‚Äútrim‚Äù its corporate workforce, it added. In a statement on May 14, Kristy Schmidt, spokeswoman for Amazon confirmed the layoffs and said that it is a part of the company's effort to ‚Äúoperate more efficiently‚Äù ‚ÄúAs part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product road map, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles. We don‚Äôt make these decisions lightly, and we‚Äôre committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions,‚Äù Schmidt added. Since 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has begun the Seattle-based online retailer‚Äôs biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts. And as many as 27,000 workers were given the pink slip. Since then, several smaller rounds of layoffs in particular departments have led to job cuts across the company's various department, including some cuts in the communication division in January 2025. Till March 2025, Amazon had 1.56 million workers ‚Äî the number include those on the rolls in full-time and part-time jobs. This is up 3 per cent comapred to 2024. However, the e-commerce giant‚Äôs workforce is mostly made up of hourly wage earners or logistics employees in its warehouse and delivery network. The job cuts at Amazon‚Äôs devices team were reported earlier by Reuters. This development comes after Microsoft Corporation on May 13 (Tuesday) also confirmed that it is cutting 6,000 jobs across departments in a bid to ‚Äúreduce management layers‚Äù, the BB report added.

Title: Amazon Cuts 100 Jobs in Devices Unit Amid Ongoing Efficiency Drive

Amazon reportedly cut about 100 jobs in its devices and services unit, saying it did so as part of a regular business review. The layoffs amount to a small portion of the unit‚Äôs total workforce, Reuters reported Wednesday (May 14), citing a company spokesperson. ‚ÄúAs part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,‚Äù the spokesperson said, according to the report. Amazon‚Äôs devices and services unit is responsible for the Kindle eReader, Echo smart home devices, Alexa voice assistant and Zoox robotaxi, the report said. The spokesperson did not say which divisions saw layoffs, it added. Bloomberg also reported on the job cuts Wednesday, noting that Amazon has made several rounds of layoffs targeting specific departments and the company has about 1.56 million full‚Äì and part-time employees. In January, Amazon laid off dozens of people in its communications department. A company spokesperson said at the time that the changes were made after a review ‚Äúto help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and brings teams closer to customers.‚Äù It was reported at the time that Amazon has cut tens of thousands of corporate jobs since Andy Jassy became the company‚Äôs CEO in 2021. These include 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles. When announcing in January 2023 that Amazon planned to lay off more than 18,000 workers, Jassy said the economy was uncertain, the company had hired rapidly for several years, and leaders across the company were prioritizing the things that matter most to customers and the long-term health of the business. In September, Jassy said Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and require employees to work primarily in an office. ‚ÄúIf we do this work well, it will increase our teammates‚Äô ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations‚Äô ability to make customers‚Äô lives better and easier every day,‚Äù Jassy said.

Interestingly, the news comes just weeks after the tech giant posted strong financial results. A company spokesperson stated that the planned job cuts are not related to performance, but are instead aimed at reducing layers of management. In the last few years or so, we have witnessed Microsoft laying off thousands of its employees. Back in 2023, the Redmond giant announced significant job cuts, affecting 10,000 employees. Microsoft then said it was a strategic decision to immunize itself from global changes. Fast forward to September of last year, the company fired 650 employees as part of Xbox job cuts. Now, a new round of layoffs is knocking on the doors, as Microsoft has announced its plan to lay off 3% of its total employees. If we go by the number, the planned layoffs will affect at least 6,000 Microsoft employees. The layoffs will affect employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. This year, Microsoft has announced job cuts for the second time. In January, the company fired a small number of employees based on performance reviews. However, this time it‚Äôs not related to performance. In a statement to CNBC, Microsoft‚Äôs spokesperson said, ‚ÄúWe continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.‚Äù Microsoft‚Äôs spokesperson also told the news agency that one objective of the new round of layoffs is to reduce layers of management. It‚Äôs worth noting that Microsoft is funneling billions of dollars into its AI infrastructure. While it‚Äôs unclear, it could be one of the biggest reasons behind the new round of layoffs announced by Microsoft. Not to forget, the company is also actively renegotiating its partnership with OpenAI for IPO and funding. Interestingly, the new round of layoffs comes as the company posted a strong earnings report last month. The tech giant reported $70.1 billion in revenue and an 18 percent spike in profits for the January-March period. The company‚Äôs cloud computing and artificial intelligence business helped it beat Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, Amazon also announced job cuts to reduce ‚Äúunnecessary layers‚Äù in its organization. Copyright ¬©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Investigative Journalism in the Public Interest ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they‚Äôre published. One of Elon Musk‚Äôs employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk‚Äôs biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young‚Äôs dual role ‚Äî working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency ‚Äî likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is ‚Äúduplicative.‚Äô‚Äô Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that ‚Äúwould cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality‚Äù and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to unwind the consumer agency‚Äôs operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young‚Äôs arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB ‚Äî which regulates companies that provide financial services ‚Äî has jurisdiction over Musk‚Äôs electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world‚Äôs richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory, ‚ÄúDelete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.‚Äù ‚ÄúMusk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,‚Äù said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúAnd therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk‚Äôs personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.‚Äù Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk‚Äôs political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk‚Äôs payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk‚Äôs Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to ‚Äúadvise political and public policy.‚Äù Beyond that description, it‚Äôs not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company‚Äôs activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk‚Äôs family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk‚Äôs children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE‚Äôs activities, said that Young‚Äôs government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. ‚ÄúWhich hat are you wearing while you‚Äôre serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?‚Äù she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk‚Äôs private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will ‚Äúcontinue to participate‚Äù in a ‚Äúdefined contribution plan‚Äù sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a ‚Äúvice president‚Äù of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on ‚Äúpolitical and public policy,‚Äù the records show. While he lists the latter among ‚Äúsources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,‚Äù the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn‚Äôt respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn‚Äôt return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn‚Äôt responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll recuse myself if it is a conflict.‚Äù The revelation of Young‚Äôs apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration‚Äôs attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning ‚Äî actions one expert called a ‚Äúpretty clear-cut violation‚Äù of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he ‚Äúdid not even manage‚Äù the layoffs, ‚Äúmaking this entire narrative an outright lie.‚Äù A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn‚Äôt clear whether he did and the White House hasn‚Äôt answered questions about that. ‚ÄúThese allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE‚Äôs critical mission,‚Äù the White House said. Following ProPublica‚Äôs reporting, the aide‚Äôs work at the CFPB ended. On Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica‚Äôs coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to ‚Äúswiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.‚Äù ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it‚Äôs unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE‚Äôs efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. ‚ÄúIt matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,‚Äù she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB‚Äôs acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau‚Äôs staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency‚Äôs employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration‚Äôs first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB‚Äôs headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency‚Äôs acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted ‚ÄúCFPB RIP‚Äù with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including ‚Äúall contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.‚Äù Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk‚Äôs Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the ‚Äúpresent.‚Äù Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration‚Äôs cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB‚Äôs chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a ‚Äúreduction in force,‚Äù or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were ‚Äúprepared to implement the RIF‚Äù if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration‚Äôs proposed cuts. Read More In addition to his employment, Young‚Äôs disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau‚Äôs ‚ÄúProhibited Holdings‚Äù list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock‚Äôs value ‚Äî such as stripping the CFPB of its staff ‚Äî constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn‚Äôt responded to questions about that either. Al Shaw contributed reporting and Alex Mierjeski contributed research.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Price is one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption. But thanks to a new type of battery, General Motors plans to slash the cost of some of its rechargeable vehicles. The battery, which has been under development for a decade, uses more of the cheaper elements like manganese and far less cobalt and nickel than current lithium-ion cells. That will cut the cost of battery packs in models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer and Cadillac Escalade by more than $6,000, a GM executive told Forbes. And while GM currently falls behind Tesla as the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., that could change as Elon Musk‚Äôs firm struggles. Chime CEO and cofounder Chris Britt As the stock market rebounds, Chime, America‚Äôs largest digital bank, has filed publicly with the SEC for an initial public offering, revealing its detailed financials. Chime has catered largely to younger Americans earning between $35,000 and $65,000 and has built a sticky business by requiring customers to set up direct deposit to get access to a growing list of features. Donald Trump is considering accepting a plane from Qatar, a gesture from the energy-rich monarchy that plays directly to the billionaire‚Äôs ego. Trump has long preferred oversized planes, personalizing airliners too big to land in some airports over the more nimble jets that most executives prefer. Alan Marcus, a communications consultant who used to ride on Trump‚Äôs old Boeing 727, compared it to a stereotypical debate over the size of‚Äã one‚Äôs male anatomy. Prices rose less than economists expected in the first inflation report since President Donald Trump unveiled his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs. But while it was the most moderate inflation reading in over four years, the data doesn‚Äôt capture the full impact of tariffs on consumers‚Äîand the frequent changes in the tariff rates make it difficult to gauge what that will look like. In a move that could provide relief to ecommerce firms like Shein and Temu, the White House said it lowered tariffs on packages from China valued at less than $800 from 120% to 54%. Packages under that value were previously exempt from tariffs or customs duties through the ‚Äúde minimis‚Äù loophole, which Trump eliminated, then reinstated, then eliminated again. After Forbes uncovered financial problems and layoffs at Wondermind, the mental health startup cofounded by actor and business mogul Selena Gomez, it set off a debate over how much Gomez is really worth. Forbes found that Gomez is very wealthy, but not a billionaire, worth roughly $700 million‚Äîthough she still ranks among the wealthiest self-made women entrepreneurs in the country. A key court hearing took place Tuesday, as a coalition of small businesses are seeking to block President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs as legal challenges against the import taxes move forward.

(Photo by Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Court/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) President Donald Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a day after announcing plans to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, a significant boost to the country‚Äôs new leadership as it attempts to shore up international support after a nearly a decade and a half-long civil war. Addressing the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Trump said he ‚Äúfelt very strongly‚Äù that dropping the ‚Äúreally crippling‚Äù sanctions would give Syria a chance.

Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World‚Äôs Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista After a decade-long beef with the SEC as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, the world‚Äôs largest meatpacker was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company‚Äîincluding bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns of price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Over the past two decades, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista have turned their family‚Äôs South American meat business into a global goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Agnus Beef. The Batista brothers are the company‚Äôs largest shareholders, and Forbes estimates that Joesley and Wesley are worth $4.8 billion each. They have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil. But the Batistas‚Äô fortune changed when Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS‚Äô dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim‚Äôs Pride. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation. WHY IT MATTERS In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon, though a JBS spokesperson denies that. Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS ‚Äúmore resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.‚Äù MORE Who‚Äôs Afraid Of Big Bad Boar‚Äôs Head? The U.S. faces substantial potential economic losses as a Canadian travel boycott continues to intensify. Canadians comprise the single largest cohort of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S.: 35%: The decline in the number of Canadians road-tripping to the U.S. last month, compared to a 20% drop for air travel $20.5 billion: How much Canadian travelers spent in the U.S. in 2024 140,000: The number of jobs that would be jeopardized by just a 10% reduction in Canadian inbound tourism, the U.S. Travel Association warned In times of economic uncertainty, many employers turn to layoffs‚Äîbut there are hidden costs associated with cutting positions. Beyond the expenses like providing severance and increased administrative work, employee productivity can plummet, and studies have shown that voluntary turnover often increases as well. If it‚Äôs necessary to cut back, try to optimize management layers, reduce the workforce through natural attrition, and if you must lay off employees, be sure to treat them with dignity.

Title: The streaming wars are no longer just about who is the biggest

Good morning. One of the key accusers in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial testified Tuesday in court. R&B singer Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs for over a decade, spoke about joining in on the drug-fueled sex marathons that he called "freak offs." In today's big story, ESPN finally unveiled the streaming-only version of its channel, and it comes as streamers reevaluate how they judge success. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Brevan Howard taps a longtime JPMorgan dealmaker for a new senior role. Tech: Job cuts are officially underway at Microsoft. Business: The hidden intention behind some companies' RTO plans isn't about getting back to the office. But first, what channel stream is it on? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the last holdouts of the streaming era is finally making a move. ESPN unveiled plans ‚Äî and a price ‚Äî for its long-awaited streaming version of the sports channel. Business Insider's Peter Kafka has the rundown on Tuesday's launch event for ESPN's new service, which will cost $30 a month. (Not to be confused with ESPN+, which has been around for over seven years. While ESPN+ streams live games, the biggest sporting events can't be watched there without a cable TV subscription. Unlike ESPN+, this new streamer will include everything you'd get if you were watching ESPN on cable TV.) ESPN's willingness to finally cut the cord shows how much the TV landscape has changed. But it's not just streamers fighting for subscribers. From engagement to subscriber growth to profitability, streamers have different priorities, writes BI's James Faris. So what are the different strategies, and who is running them? James does a great job of breaking it all down, but here's a quick rundown. The engagement approach: Netflix, Amazon When you're at the top, you sometimes have to find new ways to define success. After clearing the 300 million subscriber milestone, Netflix is now focusing on keeping users engaged rather than just growing. The reason? Engaged users are good for ads, which is the next big opportunity the streamer sees. It's not alone, as Amazon went all in on ads last year when it automatically turned them on for Prime Video users who weren't willing to cough up $3 a month to remove them. The subscriber approach: Disney, Paramount+, Peacock For those not lucky enough to have a massive subscriber base, growing the number of users is still a priority. One challenge has been keeping the momentum from big events like the Olympics or NFL playoff games. Of course, sometimes you might have even more viewers than you realize. That's why password-sharing crackdowns are all the rage. The profitability approach: Max Subscribers. Engagement. Let's be honest, the end goal is the same: making money. Warner Bros. Discovery already conceded that Max won't rule the streaming roost. But it is in the black, something some of its peers can't claim. 1. Inflation surprisingly cooled in April. The inflation rate slowed to 2.3% last month from March's 2.4% year-over-year bump, making it the smallest increase since 2021. Still, forecasters said the effects of the trade war could show up as soon as next month. On the plus side, eggs are back on the menu for breakfast. 2. Brevan Howard hires Carlos Hernandez. The longtime JPMorgan dealmaker will be Brevan Howard's first-ever executive chair. A person close to the manager told BI that Hernandez's role will focus on high-level corporate strategy and client development. 3. Getting a job in secondaries. The investment strategy of buying stakes in private funds from investors who want to sell early used to be niche. Secondaries are now fundraising at record levels, and a lucrative career path is emerging. Here's how to land a job in the booming industry. 1. Microsoft's job cuts are here. The software giant has started culling managers and noncoders as part of its plan to shed about 6,000 jobs. It wants fewer managers with more reports, consistent with an industrywide push to flatten management layers. 2. AI companies stand to win in Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" ‚Äî for now. The bill includes a provision preventing states from regulating AI for 10 years, a godsend for companies like OpenAI and Meta. However, there's a good reason they shouldn't start celebrating yet. 3. The CEOs behind your favorite YouTube stars. Content creators from MrBeast to Smosh are hiring leaders from Hollywood, talent management firms, and creator economy startups to level up their businesses. These executives allow creators to focus on content ‚Äî and avoid burnout. 1. Employers have found a sneaky substitute for layoffs. Rather than conducting layoffs, some employers are using RTO mandates to get workers to quit. But companies adopting this take-it-or-leave-it approach to RTO can end up with the worst of both worlds, BI's Aki Ito writes. 2. You can now book private chefs and personal trainers on Airbnb. The company rolled out Airbnb Services, which lets users hire professionals like hairstylists or photographers to come to their Airbnb or home. An exec told BI it's one way the company is trying to win customers back from hotels. 3. Trump is asking Americans to do the one thing they hate most. Buying things is a national pastime, and Trump is the king of conspicuous consumption. But after issuing tariffs, the president is preaching austerity ‚Äî a misread of both America's economy and culture. Sony reports earnings.

The company had around 228,000 employees worldwide as of June, it says, meaning more than 6,500 could be affected by the cuts. It would be one of the company‚Äôs largest staff reductions since it cut 10,000 people in 2023. A Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch, ‚ÄúWe continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.‚Äù In April, Microsoft reported a solid quarter of $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 18%), which was even better than analysts expected. Even so, this new round of layoffs is expected to hit all levels, locations, and teams. The company also had layoffs back in January, though it said those were performance-based. This fresh round of layoffs is not performance-related, a spokesperson told CNBC. Thousands upon thousands of workers have been laid off from Big Tech companies in just the past year. Amazon and Meta also conducted layoffs in January. Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch. She is based in New York City.

Morning Rundown: The fight over Trump‚Äôs agenda bill, Gavin Newsom‚Äôs shift on homelessness, and Memphis residents take on Elon Musk Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Microsoft on Tuesday said that it‚Äôs laying off 3% of employees across all levels, teams and geographies. ‚ÄúWe continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,‚Äù a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. The company reported better-than-expected results, with $25.8 billion in quarterly net income, and an upbeat forecast in late April. Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, meaning that the move will affect thousands of employees. It‚Äôs likely Microsoft‚Äôs largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. In January the company announced a small round of layoffs that were performance-based. These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said. One objective is to reduce layers of management, the spokesperson said. In January Amazon announced that it was getting rid of some employees after noticing ‚Äúunnecessary layers‚Äù in its organization. Last week cybersecurity software provider CrowdStrike announced it would lay off 5% of its workforce. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company would make sales execution changes that led to lower growth than expected in Azure cloud revenue that wasn‚Äôt tied to artificial intelligence. Performance in AI cloud growth outdid internal projections. ‚ÄúHow do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?‚Äù Nadella said. ‚ÄúAt a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don‚Äôt keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation.‚Äù On Monday, Microsoft shares stopped trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. They closed at a record $467.56 last July. Jordan Novet is a CNBC technology reporter specializing in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and Microsoft. ¬© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nearly 7,000 workers are out as Microsoft confirms across-the-board layoffs

Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) is laying off about 3% of its workforce, its largest headcount cut in more than two years. The layoffs have not been formally announced via press release or SEC filing but were first reported on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that it‚Äôs laying off about 3% of its global workforce. With around 228,000 employees worldwide, the move will impact nearly 7,000 people ‚Äî making it the company‚Äôs largest round of layoffs since it cut 10,000 roles in early 2023. Microsoft framed the move as part of ‚Äúorganizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.‚Äù (What, not ‚Äúvibrant‚Äù or ‚Äúrobust‚Äù?) Unlike a smaller round of performance-based cuts in January, these layoffs are not tied to individual performance. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is working to reduce layers of management and adjust its structure amid ongoing platform shifts. The news comes just weeks after Microsoft delivered what Wedbush dubbed an ‚ÄúAaron Judge-like‚Äù earnings performance that helped reset the narrative around AI monetization. Revenue hit $70.1 billion, up 13%, with Azure and other cloud revenue growing 33% year-over-year, a better clip than some analysts predicted. Nearly half of that cloud growth came from AI workloads. Microsoft stock is up around 6% year to date, and up over 200% since the pandemic-era stock lows of 2020. The tech industry has been through a sweeping labor reset since 2023, when giants like Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), and Google (GOOGL-1.57%) began unwinding what some observers believed was pandemic-era overhiring. Amazon cut more than 27,000 roles in waves, Meta laid off over 21,000 employees during its so-called ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and Microsoft eliminated 10,000 positions, marking its biggest workforce reduction in years. Google‚Äôs parent company Alphabet let go of 12,000 employees, while Salesforce (CRM-0.74%), Spotify (SPOT+5.12%), and Lyft (LYFT-1.87%) also trimmed deeply. By 2024, layoffs grew more selective as leadership leaned into artificial intelligence and long-term profitability. Mass cuts gave way to more surgical trims, with companies saying sayonara to low-priority initiatives or those misaligned with fresh strategic visions. Meta pulled back in Reality Labs and infrastructure, Amazon slimmed down parts of AWS and retail tech, and Salesforce restructured to ‚Äúfocus on the core,‚Äù often shorthand for shedding teams that no longer fit the investor story. While the headline-grabbing rounds mostly subsided, the pruning seems to have never really stopped. Tech firms have quietly kept reshaping their org charts, thinning layers, and reallocating headcount toward AI-driven bets. White-collar workers‚Äô group chats everywhere remain alight with news of cuts or threatened cuts. Tuesday‚Äôs move by Microsoft slots cleanly into the narrative. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. Gig jobs are not longer optional in today‚Äôs tight economy. Amid the rise of financial uncertainty and inflation, more people are turning to flexible online work, including freelancing, e-commerce and AI-powered content creation to keep up with skyrocketing costs. One reason side gigs are becoming the new normal is that workers are tired of the stress and uncertainty in a job that could end at any moment. Side gigs give you the autonomy to be the captain of your own ship, instead of a passenger whose fate is determined by big business that might not have your best interests at heart. Statistics show that 71% of Americans are searching for secondary income sources through side gigs. As prices soar and the new administration continues making cuts, the economy is tightening, and AI advances are causing massive layoffs. Here are five reasons you need a side gig in the 2025 job market: to increase your income, reduce financial stress, gain more opportunities, enjoy more flexibility and save time with job searches. I spoke with Avery Morgan, CHRO at EduBirdie, and she told me that extra money isn‚Äôt really extra anymore, that it‚Äôs a necessity for many of today‚Äôs workers. ‚ÄúFor many Americans, side hustles aren‚Äôt optional in today's economy, they help them to keep up with rising costs, uncertainty, and evolving career priorities.‚Äù Morgan cites statistics showing that nearly 39% of employed adults already earn extra income, and another 17% plan to join them soon. she points out that for 41% of workers, that extra cash already goes to make ends meet. ‚ÄúAnd with Trump‚Äôs tariffs projected to cost the average household $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, low- and middle-income Americans could be hit much harder,‚Äù she asserts. A new survey from the global online tutoring platform Superprof reveals a growing shift in how Americans are approaching side gigs. One in three survey respondents said they‚Äôre willing to dedicate five-to‚Äì10 hours a week to online work. Respondents say the top five online money-making activities they‚Äôre involved in are taking online surveys, online investing, freelancing, selling on e-commerce platforms and testing websites and apps. You can find more high-paying side hustles, requiring no experience here. Morgan argues that, if you think side hustles aren‚Äôt worth it, you‚Äôre wrong. She notes that in 2024, the average gig job brought in $891 per month (that‚Äôs over $10K per year), with nearly 19% of people earning over $1,000. The best part, she underscores, is that many of the side gigs can fit into your schedule without overwhelming your day job. She lists four lucrative side gigs that can earn top dollar: ‚ÄúGood writing skills are still in demand, no matter what they say about AI,‚Äù Morgan insists. ‚ÄúThe ability to break down complex ideas and make engaging, thoughtful content can easily turn into a lucrative side hustle.‚Äù She points out that many coaches, executives or creatives are looking for someone to help them with their writing, such as LinkedIn posts, podcast scripts or online course modules. She emphasizes that they need this assistance on a regular basis, willing to pay about $500-$2500 per month. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need many clients to get started,‚Äù Morgan notes. ‚ÄúJust offer your services to people you know, or email someone directly on LinkedIn. If you have strong writing skills, it‚Äôs a great way to earn extra income remotely. Plus, you'll get to learn from industry pros and build valuable connections.‚Äù Morgan points out that an empty garage, parking space, shed or even your backyard can all be turned into extra income. ‚ÄúOn platforms like Neighbor, Spacer or Peerspace, it‚Äôs simple: take a couple of photos, list a price and place an ad. A garage or shed can be rented out to store other people‚Äôs stuff, it can bring $50 to $300 a month. And your backyard can get you $100-$1000 per booking, if you host photo shoots or small events. Another option is to rent out things you have lying around, such as power tools, marquees, barbecues, sports gear or musical instruments. Altogether, it can bring from $500 to $2000 per month.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you like plants, try growing simple succulents or cacti at home. They are unpretentious and do not require much care,‚Äù Morgan recommends. ‚ÄúAfter one to two months, you will have accumulated mature plants you can use to make sets like ‚Äòa gift for a colleague‚Äô or ‚Äògreenery on the desktop.‚Äô She suggests selling them on sites like Etsy, eBay, or Amazon Handmade. ‚ÄùIt takes about $50 for pots, soil, and the first plants to get started," she explains. ‚ÄúFrom there, all you need is a little time for plant care and sorting out the delivery. Selling three to five kits a week at $20 to $40, you can make $300 to $1,000 a month doing this in your free time.‚Äù Morgan mentions that you can earn money simply by sharing your opinions on buying goods, services you use or just your experience. ‚ÄúThese sessions are held online, often via video and typically take 30 minutes to an hour,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúYou can get $50 to $250 per participation.‚Äù She recommends that you try sites like User Interviews, Respondent.io and Prolific, which target working professionals, parents or niche audiences. ‚ÄúTo get started, just sign up, fill out your profile and respond to offers,‚Äù she advises. ‚ÄúEven if you only participate in 2-3 surveys a month, that‚Äôs already $200-300.‚Äù SideHustles.com advises employers and job seekers to prepare for a potential hiring surge starting this month. May is the peak month for people to quit their jobs, with 27% of resignations each year happening during the month of May. If you‚Äôre tight for income, side gigs can help you get ahead and stay on your feet in this fast-changing, uncertain economy.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Buyers to weigh the flexibility of digital with the Upfront‚Äôs legacy scale

This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series ‚Üí NewFronts week is done, and the video ad marketplace is about to hear from the veteran TV sellers of linear, cable and streaming ‚Äî with YouTube pushing itself right into the middle of proceedings. Could 2025 be the year that ad dollars shift in greater volume from the linear broadcast and cable networks to the more investment-flexible, cost-efficient and consumer-friendly digital video environment showcased all last week? Several major publishers and the IAB last week presented their content wares and new ad units, while playing up brand safety as well. According to two of four media buyers Digiday spoke with, LinkedIn, of all Newfronts players, surprised the most with its presentation. First-time NewFronts presenter LinkedIn ‚Äúwent more tactile and opportunistic, and data- and AI-focused vs. ‚Äòhere‚Äôs our big, splashy new content program,‚Äô‚Äù said Angela Dahir, vp of strategy & media planning at Jellyfish. ‚ÄúIt was more tactile functionality for us that we could then take to our clients who are in that B2B space, which we have a lot of ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of unearthed opportunity in LinkedIn.‚Äù Another media buyer who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that LinkedIn stood out, but even for reasons beyond B2B opportunities. ‚ÄúWhat was impressive about what they shared was just the narrative on how video on their platform is something that really impacts business decision makers,‚Äù said the buyer, who was also impressed by LinkedIn‚Äôs ability to offer data both on- and off-platform. ‚ÄúBusiness influencers, are really aiding in that, now that brands can kind of get involved with those business creators in a new way.‚Äù But it‚Äôs the more flexible investment opportunities that could sway some marketers and their media agencies to spend among NewFronts publishers rather than the classic TV providers ‚Äî certainly at a time of great economic uncertainty (tariffs, interest rates, flagging consumer sentiment stats, unpredictable government policies, etc). ‚ÄúI think the benefits of cost efficiencies outweigh some of that upfront commitment and the pricing ‚Äî the larger monetary commitment,‚Äù said Lindsey Freed, svp of media investment at Basis Technologies. ‚ÄúWith more CTV streaming [and] programmatic buying, we‚Äôre seeing the rate efficiencies and the ability to target in very similar ways ‚Äî it‚Äôs what the buzz is all about ‚Ä¶ The flexibility of being able to execute across that media, rather than committing a large dollar amount upfront is really where we‚Äôre going to see the shift.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of evaluation going on of media spend,‚Äù said Tucker Matheson, CEO of Markacy, who said none of his clients are actually cutting budgets ‚Äî yet. ‚ÄúBrands in a budget pinch are ‚Ä¶ really just trying to figure out where‚Äôs my biggest bang for my buck.‚Äù To Matheson, the answer lies in applying incrementality testing to guide them to the right investment. But there are also a number of new ad-unit opportunities being rolled out by some of the NewFronts presenters, as a means of attracting more ad dollars from brands of all size ‚Äî some of which caught the eye of buyers. Some of the OEM providers like LG and Vizio showed off units including: ‚ÄúAs media buyers, we‚Äôre really going to have to think about these new [habits], thinking of the consumer, what they‚Äôre doing, and tying our buys together to allow for that ease of shopping on our phone or shopping while we‚Äôre watching TV,‚Äù Basis Technologies‚Äô Freed said. ‚ÄúCTV, for sure, offers a lot more of that potential to do more complex or interactive ad formats, whether it‚Äôs shoppable or just general formats than what you can do on linear,‚Äù said Chris Rigas, vp of media at Markacy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely an appeal to that. It‚Äôs obviously clear that CTV is going to continue gaining market share.‚Äù Of course, the linear companies also offer some of these innovations too, which can‚Äôt be forgotten ‚Äî just like they offer the lion‚Äôs share of sports content. But again, the buyers Digiday spoke with said sports is clearly no longer the exclusive territory of the linear giants like NBC U or Disney. With Amazon, Tubi, Hulu and others now offering professional league sports content, it‚Äôs a more even playing field than ever. ‚ÄúThis one has live sports and that one has live sports, and everyone‚Äôs getting connected through the pipeline,‚Äù said Jellyfish‚Äôs Dahir. ‚ÄúThe digital marketplace is becoming now the crux of opportunity, because we have so much more access and more clients that are able to play in this video space that maybe we‚Äôre not able to in the past.‚Äù For better or worse, that diaspora of sports content raises its own set of problems for media buyers and planners. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm watching [sports] on Peacock, but through my Chromecast, I get a different ad,‚Äù noted Dahir. ‚ÄúThis creates a very fragmented landscape for live sports ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm curious to see if there will eventually be a step backward. Because, yes, it gives us more opportunity of getting more efficient and effective buys in live sports, especially for smaller clients and that need for efficiency. But from a rating standpoint, I wonder if there will eventually be a pushback ‚Ä¶ because there‚Äôs too many touch points that you can tag it.‚Äù And that‚Äôs where programmatic steps in with both the offer of promise and potential for confusion. Much like three years ago, when CTV content became more available through programmatic investment, it ushered in the chance for smaller advertisers to get into TV advertising. But it also made a mess of not knowing who repped what inventory. That could happen with sports content today. Because the fact is, there‚Äôs a bottom-line shift that is taking place across the entire video landscape: the continued increase of programmatic investment vs. direct buying. ‚ÄúOne theme that hit for me at the NewFronts was that personalized is premium and it‚Äôs more about the curation of content and context,‚Äù said the buyer on background. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs making sure that your ads are appearing within the content you wanted to appear with the audience targeting that you need. Programmatic makes that more easily possible and the workflow is way easier ‚Äî when done right.‚Äù Added Basis Technologies‚Äô Freed: ‚ÄúFor buyers, it‚Äôs easier because we have more control ‚Äî we are able to shift budgets between deal IDs easier than we can direct buys.‚Äù Amazon may be one the fastest growing powerhouses in major media, rivaling Google and Meta for supremacy ‚Äî but it does have one problem. It seems more consumers are looking into how to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions than any other streamer, according to a study by Sparrow, which helps consumers get money from class-action suits. Here‚Äôs the data (although it must be noted, the below stats are of people searching for how to cancel, not actual cancellations): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just changing the logo on the slide and saying, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to aggregate, and centralize all my media spend.‚Äô And they‚Äôre going to lean heavier into principal media buying, and this allows them to make it easier for them to do that.‚Äù Microsoft is closing Xandr Invest, a sign that of its increased focus on AI and a harbinger of further ad tech consolidation. The Trade Desk‚Äôs Jeff Green discusses ad tech‚Äôs big issues. In this edition of the Digiday+ Research Briefing, we examine the impact of tariffs on consumers, retailers and advertisers.
