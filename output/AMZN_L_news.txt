Title: A founder said her $200 million newsletter empire had over a million subscribers. Her own records tell a different story.

Daniella Pierson is a proponent of faking it till you make it. The 30-year-old founder of The Newsette Media Group, known for its daily newsletter about style and pop culture, says it's been key to her trajectory: a $9 million SoHo apartment, a net worth reported to be $220 million, and mentors like Serena Williams and Diane von Furstenberg. "I faked it till I made it," she told a Stanford Business School audience in 2024, recalling that she pretended to be an intern when her company was a one-woman affair to drum up interest and used made-up names when communicating with partners. A Business Insider investigation into Pierson's enterprise reveals that pretending to be her own intern may not have been her only distortion of reality. A review of internal documents and dashboards, recordings of meetings, and interviews with more than 10 company insiders uncovered questions about what Pierson has told the public and advertisers about her business when compared with what her own records show — including how many subscribers her newsletter has. A spokesperson for Pierson confirmed to Business Insider that The Newsette's daily newsletter goes out to about 500,000 subscribers each day. That's less than half the 1.3 million subscribers claimed in a 2025 pitch deck to advertisers and the million-plus referenced by Pierson in multiple public appearances. The spokesperson said that the larger figure reflects the company's overall email list, which includes what they described as "disengaged subscribers" who have been "funneled out" of the daily newsletter by a quality control mechanism. In a statement sent to Business Insider and posted on Instagram, Pierson called criticism of her business a "smear campaign," and said claims involve "false statements and fabricated information" meant to hamper her ability to continue supporting women through her companies. "They messed with the wrong person," she wrote. Pierson has touted The Newsette Media Group's 2021 revenue — $40 million, according to both Pierson and former employees — in public appearances as recently as last year. She's never publicly revealed revenue figures for subsequent years. Company documents seen by Business Insider paint a less rosy picture for last year: The company's 2024 revenue goal was $5 million. The Pierson spokesperson said this number was not accurate but declined to provide further information. They added that the company is currently profitable. Part of the revenue decline can be attributed to the 2023 shuttering of Newland, the creative agency that Pierson launched in late 2020 as part of The Newsette Media Group. She said Newland drove more revenue than the newsletter business itself in 2021. The Newsette Media Group now employs eight people, down from 40 at its peak, the Pierson spokesperson said. Pierson's business, by multiple measures, has fallen from its heights. It's a problem she's familiar with. In a 2024 TEDx Talk, Pierson spoke about "all of the billionaire guys" who had raised capital and whose companies were now "worth zero." "People don't realize, you have $1 billion on paper, that paper can burn real fast," she said. Over the past decade, Pierson has perfected her founder narrative. An identical twin, Pierson struggled in school and was labeled, in her own telling, "the dumb twin." When she got to Boston University, she said in multiple podcast interviews, she floundered in school, uninspired by learning about the Earth's crust and how to properly measure the area of a triangle. She decided to focus on what she did like — magazines — and founded The Newsette as a newsletter during her sophomore year at the age of 19. Every morning, she'd wake up at 5 a.m. and spend five hours drafting a newsletter for her subscribers. During class, she DM-ed people on Facebook, telling them that if they brought on new subscribers, they could add "Newsette ambassador" to their résumés. "When I started in 2015, there weren't any newsletters out there," she'd later tell the audience at Stanford. (Prominent launches of newsletters with a similar flair included The Skimm in 2012 and Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop in 2008.) Once she graduated and had hammered out the product details, she couldn't find investors. Instead, she took a $15,000 loan from her parents. She's said she has since repaid the loan and has posted on Instagram that she "made her mom a millionaire" by giving her a stake in Newsette Media Group. Without venture backing, she had to be profitable right away, she said, so she began selling ads, making $25,000 in her first month of accepting advertisers in 2017. Pierson was successful in attracting press attention, at first from small college-targeted outlets and her hometown station, later from outlets including Elle, WWD, and Business Insider. The interviews were peppered with her catch-phrases: The Newsette was a "gift in your inbox," she often said, and at the beginning, she had three employees, "me, myself, and I." In 2019, a meeting with von Furstenberg, whom Pierson calls her fairy godmother, resulted in a partnership with the fashion designer: a publication called the Weekly Wrap, which Pierson said on the "Money Rehab" podcast was one of her big breaks. In early December 2019, she appeared on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, saying The Newsette had grown to 500,000 subscribers. Revenue, Pierson said in a number of interviews, shot from $1 million in 2019 to $7 million in 2020 to $40 million — $10 million of it profit — in 2021. She said that revenue and the company's 500,000-plus subscribers allowed her to sell a 1.25% stake in the company at a $200 million valuation. The Pierson spokesperson declined to say who the investor was. Based on The Newsette Media Group's valuation and her stake in Wondermind, a mental-health startup she had cofounded with Selena Gomez and Gomez's mom, Forbes reported she was worth $220 million in August 2022. That made her the youngest, wealthiest self-made BIPOC woman in America, according to the magazine, a title she repeats with gusto. An examination of company documents shows a growing gap between the subscriber numbers Pierson gave publicly and what was on the books. On August 10, 2022, the day the Forbes story came out touting more than half a million subscribers, The Newsette had 411,000, according to documentation reviewed by Business Insider. In a 2023 interview with Forbes, she said it was on track to reach 1 million subscribers by the end of the year. According to company documentation, The Newsette had no more than 570,000 subscribers that year. At the 2024 Stanford talk, she said she had hit the 1 million mark; the records say The Newsette had fallen below 500,000. She repeated those numbers to advertisers. A pitch deck used earlier this year claims that The Newsette has "1.3 million+ subscribers" who receive its weekday, Saturday, and Sunday editions. A spokesperson for Pierson told Business Insider that there are 1.2 million emails in the company's total contact list — including people who no longer receive the newsletter regularly — and said the daily edition currently goes out to about 500,000 active subscribers. Jacob Donnelly, the founder of A Media Operator, a newsletter-based publication for people building digital media companies, said that standard industry practice is that the number of subscriptions refers to the number of people who receive the newsletter. "If I were to go out and say I have 1.3 million subscribers, what I'm saying to the advertiser is when I hit send, it's going out to 1.3 million people," he said, speaking generally and not about The Newsette specifically. "If someone is not subscribed to a product, I don't see how they could be classified as a subscriber." In a meeting with a potential advertiser earlier this year, a recording of which Business Insider reviewed, Pierson mentioned a subscriber count of "a million" and boasted that "every single day, our sponsors get at least 250,000 unique views." In the more than two years of newsletter data that Business Insider reviewed, The Newsette's newsletter only hit that many unique opens one time. More than half of the days, it had fewer than 200,000. At the end of 2020, von Furstenberg personally pitched Pierson to Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Pierson previously told Business Insider. The tech giant soon became one of the first clients of Newland, a creative agency that became, for a short time, The Newsette Media Group's cash cow. In 2021 and into 2022, Newland completed a number of projects for Amazon; Pierson told the Stanford audience that the company "was responsible for tens of millions of dollars in revenue." The agency took a 360-degree approach to social media marketing, coming up with the brief, hiring the talent, and handling the paid media. Campaigns included a viral Prime Day TikTok push featuring Snoop Dogg and a number of creators, and content for Women's History Month with Keke Palmer, Mindy Kaling, and von Furstenberg. According to two former employees familiar with the financials, the $40 million revenue figure Pierson touted represented gross revenue, or all of the money that flowed through the company, inclusive of cash reserved for talent and paid media. Most publicly owned ad agencies report net revenue — the money left over once a campaign is finished — and not gross revenue, which includes money the agency gets to pay for things like celebrity endorsements. When Amazon underwent a reorganization toward the end of 2022 and into 2023, the company largely paused its new work with Newland, according to four former employees. Amazon declined to comment to Business Insider about its business with Newland. After Amazon's departure, Pierson struggled to bring new clients to the agency, said four former employees. Newland, Pierson said, grew to eventually employ the majority of Newsette Media Group's employees. In December 2022, Newsette conducted one of several rounds of layoffs. Former employees said the layoffs were due to a cash crunch. By the end of 2023, Newland had completely folded. The Pierson spokesperson said the job cuts were not due to a "financial crunch," but were made for the sake of "efficiencies." For 2024, the company's revenue goal was a modest $5 million, according to internal documents. The Pierson spokesperson said those numbers were not accurate, but declined to provide additional numbers or documentation. In addition to Newsette Media Group, Pierson has been involved in other ventures. In 2021, she was announced as the co-CEO of Wondermind, a mental health website that she cofounded with Selena Gomez and the singer's mother, Mandy Teefey. In 2023, she quietly left the company; the circumstances of her departure have not been disclosed. After a press release about Pierson's investment in a group attempting to purchase Forbes went out, she posted on X that she was "on the board" of the magazine. The deal ended up falling through, and she was never on any board. Her most recent venture launched in May. Chasm is a $25,000-a-year membership club that aims to "close the gender gap through entrepreneurship." The club says its members include singer Lionel Richie and Spanx's Sara Blakely, neither of whom responded to Business Insider's request for comment. Membership fees will fund a website and award monthly five-figure grants to entrepreneurs, the first of which was announced on August 6. After being contacted for comment, Pierson issued a statement — which she also shared on Instagram — claiming there was a coordinated effort by individuals "who represent everything that my gender equality initiatives have fought to change." She said they had launched a "smear campaign" against her and her companies, spreading "false statements and fabricated information" aimed at eliminating her ability to "continue to put millions of my own dollars into helping women." "These false statements don't just affect me," she wrote. "They affect the thousands of women who we fund, spotlight, or promote via my companies." She said The Newsette Media Group "absolutely did" make $40 million in 2021, and defended Chasm, saying it was "on track to give away free resources and grants for female entrepreneurs worth millions this year alone." In a 2021 podcast interview, Pierson offered a vision of what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. "If you can sell yourself," she said, "you can basically do anything."

Title: Ellison Begins High Wire Act at New PARAMOUNT...

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The ambitious Oracle heir, who once counted Steve Jobs as a mentor, hopes to turn Paramount Skydance into a tech-era media monolith. But does he have the team — or the vision — to scale that mountain? By Steven Zeitchik, Alex Weprin August 6, 2025 When David Ellison had an informal meeting with New York-based media executives at a restaurant in the city earlier this year introducing the Hollywood producer to the kind of people he’d soon be communing with, the vibe was, to say the least, amiable. The Skydance founder was awaiting FCC approval on his bid to buy Paramount, and so he chatted a little and mostly listened, the executives joking about the challenged landscape as Ellison responded with platitudes about his vision for a well-run Paramount. But one point about Ellison stood out to attendees: He talked a lot about gaming. Related Stories Business Can Paramount Pivot to Big Tech? David Ellison Outlines His Silicon Valley Vision Business David Ellison Meets the Press The emphasis spoke volumes about where Ellison’s eye is trained as he takes over Paramount: Steward a company anchored by a traditional film studio and freighted down by a lot of dated television assets, sure, but also make a big push to digital frontiers. Skydance already has a hand in this world with such VR games as Archangel and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and the chance to develop and acquire gaming companies to pair with Paramount’s robust intellectual properties and 80 million-strong streaming service Paramount+ could prove appealing. On Aug. 7, the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount deal finally closes, putting Ellison in charge of the country’s second-oldest studio — and, notably, one of its most troubled media companies. For the 42-year-old, the news represents a remarkable rise, coming just 15 years after he founded his firm and not much longer since he was written off as a wannabe actor and USC film school dropout making vanity projects like Flyboys. Even with the billions Skydance received from Ellison’s family — particularly father Larry Ellison, worth $303 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — his resurgence is the kind of thing biographers devote chapters to. The comeback for Paramount, on the other hand, is far from assured. As control of the company moves from one prominent American business family (the Redstones) to another, Ellison has talked up his tech game and has cited family friend Steve Jobs as a mentor who gave him early tough love on Skydance. Certainly the millennial comes in with some advantages: the advent of AI (which, among other things, will make content production cheaper); the use of Oracle’s top-flight cloud service to compete with what Amazon MGM can do with Amazon Web Services (AWS); Skydance’s existing partnerships with Apple and Meta on the gaming side; and even the tantalizing rumors of an Oracle stateside TikTok purchase. (If nothing else, those algorithms will make Paramount+ more Netflix-y sticky.) The automation factor in particular could get supercharged at Paramount, which unlike rivals Disney and Universal has not taken an oppositional attitude toward the tech. All suggest a company with lots of strategic upside, and those who see Paramount as an also-ran might be reminded that the rules are about to reset for everyone, as AI-powered personalized content and automated production prepare to sweep through the industry. “He’s the kind of person who’s going to take advantage of these innovations,” says a longtime exec who knows Ellison and Paramount but is not tied to either one. But how much the existing infrastructure will allow such leaps remains to be seen. Paramount is still a company built for the 1990’s, with a network TV business in CBS that is solid if hardly shiny and a cable business that is neither. Film studios are generally not a high-upside 2020’s bet, especially if some of your biggest franchises, like Mission: Impossible and Star Trek, are many installments deep. For all the hype about tech, the executive team is largely old-school Hollywood too, as new C-suite occupants such as NBC Universal veteran Jeff Shell, Sony marketing executive Josh Greenstein and even Netflix mainstay Cindy Holland cut their teeth on content, not computation. No known upstart is yet waiting in Skydance’s wings; no splashy tech import is ready to take Hollywood by storm. And talk of great tech-content synergies have accompanied many a media merger (remember AOL-Time Warner? Or AT&T-Warner?) only to end up as one more ill-fitting cost-cutting exercise (remember Discovery-Warner?) One X-factor is Andy Gordon, an incoming board member and a longtime Goldman Sachs kingmaker who’s spent the last five years with Gerry Cardinale’s entertainment-minded investment-management company RedBird Capital — and which along with Korean juggernaut CJ Group has put a lot of money into Skydance. (Along with Larry Ellison, RedBird has also helped finance the acquisition.) The ties between RedBird and the new Par go deep — Shell comes from there too — and the expectation is that Gordon as incoming Paramount COO and chief strategic officer will run point on exactly the kind of deals for his new company that he made with the likes of All3Media and Artists Equity at his old one (though, you know, with digital and AI firms). Ellison is the first figure with any tech ties, even familial, to take over a legacy media company, crossing a bridge that Disney, Universal and Rupert Murdoch have refrained from approaching. (New Paramount president Jeff Shell likes this fact, calling his ally “the perfect executive for the next-generation Hollywood company,” as “he not only can go to a table read, but he can go to the next room and code.”) At the very least, Ellison’s Hollywood experience has grown; while he was sometimes sidelined as a financier under earlier Paramount regimes, his role morphed into something more consistently substantively creative under recent studio chiefs Jim Gianopulos and Brian Robbins. Still, getting Hollywood nuts and bolts like talent relations right isn’t easy, and to say Ellison got a “C” on one of his first tests as a mogul — negotiations on a new global streaming deal with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone — would probably involve some grade inflation. A person with knowledge of the negotiations says Ellison reassured the pair’s reps that he would sign off on a deal, but days turned to weeks with no movement. The foot-dragging led Parker and Stone to flex their power, including by threatening legal action against Shell and RedBird Capital over allegedly manipulating negotiations with rivals to lower the price for Paramount. The South Park-ers eventually got their big payday. CBS’ scrapping of Stephen Colbert and the whole Late Show franchise didn’t endear Ellison much either to the talent community, whatever the extent his knowledge of or wink at George Cheeks’ moves may have actually been. The imminent slashing of deals and inevitable staff layoffs as a cost-cutting wave arrives will further stress those relationships. And Ellison’s dynamic with journalists will be put to the test as 60 Minutes remains in free fall after Bill Owens’ departure (though Tanya Simon’s elevation reassured staff for now) and a controversial $16 million settlement with the Trump administration widely seen as quid pro quo for getting FCC-approved in the first place. CBS News also will install an ombudsman, scouring for bias, which has sparked anxiety among staff. Acquisition talks with Bari Weiss’ The Free Press will raise questions about the politics of Ellison, who has described himself as a “socially liberal” person; so will his father’s ongoing tight relationship with Donald Trump. Many of the metaphors around Ellison spotlight his love of flying – he got his pilot’s license as a teenager and has been performing aerobatic stunts ever since – as Tom Cruise and every journalist in town has invoked stalls, tailslides and inside loops to describe Ellison’s approach to challenges. But in Hollywood the more apt analogy might be to Brad Pitt’s World War Z, a movie Ellison’s money bailed out after its budget ballooned and an explosive climactic scene shot in Budapest (for Red Square) was deemed, in technical industry parlance, bad. Ellison kicked in millions for rewrites and reshoots, saving the film and launching a summer blockbuster. The irony was that the filmmaking team did this by going small: the third act of that 2013 movie as newly penned by Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard famously featured a much quieter and more intimate ending in which Pitt walks carefully to outwit a single zombie. The Hollywood meaning is hard to miss: sometimes the unexpected move saves the day. Also, if you take a wrong step, you could get devoured. Pamela McClintock contributed to this report.

Title: Xbox Is An Increasingly Unstable Platform For Anyone To Invest In

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Constantly shifting motivations and tumultuous overhauls have poisoned the well of Xbox's ecosystem. By Moises Taveras on August 6, 2025 at 6:42AM PDT Xbox is going through an identity crisis. The most recent wave of layoffs at Microsoft, which cut about 9,000 jobs including numerous positions at studios under the Xbox banner, suggests as much. These cost-cutting measures are said to be in the service of some realignment or reorganization that's always purported to set up these companies for greater success. And yet they keep happening, further eroding any trust and goodwill the brand may have built up from previous successes. After several waves of job cuts, restructurings, pivots in strategy, and any other corporate jargon I've neglected to mention, I'm beginning to suspect that Xbox's growing instability deserves more scrutiny and concern from its developers and consumers alike. Let's be direct: The journey that Xbox has been on over the last decade appears to be a failure. Its famous spree of purchases and the subsequent management of its studios has churned out about as many blemished games as it has delays, cancellations, and studio closures. That isn't to say Xbox hasn't produced hits and gems, but along the way there, Xbox has also built up quite the track record of critically panned games, cancelled projects, and defunct teams.

By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy enter Now Playing: Xbox Studio Closures Are Confusing | Spot On No matter the aspect that you place under the microscope, Xbox is clearly bleeding through the bandages it keeps applying. Take a glimpse at the stable of teams at Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft's internal publishing division. Its most recent layoff resulted in the closure of at least one team under the banner, The Initiative, and the cancellation of its game Perfect Dark. Turn 10, one of its stalwart developers on the Forza franchise, has been reportedly cut to the bone. Rare, which was working on Everwild while maintaining the live-service title Sea of Thieves, is invariably in a worse position on the other side of the layoffs than it was before. The brunt of the damage from moves like these falls on the affected teams and their workers, and it's a disappointingly common move for Xbox, which has done this at least once before when a similar reorganizing shuttered four teams in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. These closures came within a few short years of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda. Another layoff followed shortly after the completed purchase of Activision Blizzard, cutting several jobs across its teams and leading to the cancellation of a survival game at Blizzard. The fact remains that bringing Bethesda's tremendous portfolio of megaton hits like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls in-house, as well as Activision Blizzard (and mobile developer King), should've stemmed the bloodloss, but Xbox's hemorrhaging and proclivity for retail therapy only seemed to worsen with each purchase. Anything else suggests the reckless endangerment of an entire industry. These moves should've uniformly led to greater stability for developers under the Xbox banner and a greater deal of games on the platforms. They didn't. Some studios, like Obsidian, have miraculously flourished under these conditions, producing new franchises and hits in existing ones, solidifying its place in Xbox's crumbling hierarchy of studios. Others, like Arkane Austin, haven't been as lucky. And gamers and developers alike suffer when that's the case. If everyone's going through it, who exactly is benefitting from Xbox's continued vision--or lack thereof? The motivation behind many of these purchases is an obvious one: Game Pass. Since its launch in 2017, the subscription service has been Xbox's biggest talking point, and as the years have passed, it has grown into the single biggest driver for engagement with the gaming division. Following the Xbox One's opening fumbles and hurdles, Microsoft devised a silver bullet that could rebuild its ecosystem and assure its biggest and smallest games had an audience. The service has even paid for the development of independent and third-party titles, making it a lifeline to some. But Game Pass has been a pain to grow despite its occasional surges, and its continued upkeep remains costly despite Xbox's claims that the service is profitable, with some major caveats. As a result, Xbox has even transformed Game Pass for the worse, introducing tiers that sell greater benefits for high-paying subscribers, all the while stripping access to portions of the expansive game library from members at the lowest levels. This move is a sharp reversal of Game Pass' earliest promises to connect gamers to the breadth of the console's titles. What once was often touted as the best deal in gaming has now become so diluted that it is now more anti-consumer than its original incarnation. Another line crossed. And though Game Pass funds the development of a number of projects, and still does, many developers have spoken up about how Game Pass has actually hurt their teams and titles. Mike Rose of the indie publisher No More Robots has been pretty open in the past about how Game Pass can assure a huge launch audience, which is great for teams struggling to find players, but also noted how the team's games would see little change in sales after being on the service. Instead, it typically got spikes just as it was entering the subscription service. Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane and later Wolfeye Studios, has become one of the service's biggest critics, recently opining that it is an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money.'" An isolated incident would be one thing, but grievances like Colantonio's have continually cropped up over the years, even if there are other stories that cite Game Pass as instrumental to a game's success. The evidence points to a concerning trend in the Xbox camp that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and the more it's left as-is, the more likely it seems that developers will have to make a tough decision about their futures in Microsoft's ecosystem. Of course, it's hard to prove either side is wrong or right due to the fact that Microsoft obscures any numbers that could illuminate or disprove these arguments--numbers that Bloomberg's Jason Schreier refers to as "squishy metrics" subject to the whims of "dark accounting wizardry." This means that teams looking for a publishing deal with Xbox simply need to take the company at its word when evaluating whether Game Pass is the right move for their game and their business. But what good is that word with the uncertainty that has persistently hung over Xbox's motivations and decisions for much of the last decade? Is it worth it to take that opportunity and fund that game if the near-future of your team continues to hang in the balance? Doesn't Xbox owe its developers more than false promises of stability once they join the Game Pass service considering how impactfully it can hurt a team's bottom line? Doesn't it owe the same kind of dependability to its subscribers? I feel that answering these questions requires more foresight than I've observed from the brand. After all, this is the gaming giant that settled on the multimedia-heavy approach to the Xbox One that crippled the console out of the gate, and then took away Xbox users' ability to purchase and own digital movies and TV shows recently. It's also the company that settled on an "Everything is an Xbox" marketing campaign that deemphasized the system itself after giving up so much ground to its contemporaries. The campaign isn't an affront itself, but when paired with the worsening Game Pass service, which is how the company can afford to turn smart TVs, Amazon Fire Sticks, and even your PC into an Xbox, the rottenness of the tactic becomes more apparent. Xbox's direction seems to pivot with the wind, and it means that the consumers who buy into its products, as well as the engineers who make them, and the developers that then work to give them value, constantly feel like they're sold up the river for the next big thing that the company does. I don't feel answers coming any time soon. If the latest layoffs are any indication, Xbox's path forward is set in stone, and whatever may come of it has already been deemed worthy of the sacrifice it took to to be realized. As Christopher Dring of The Game Business succinctly puts it, the Xbox we knew is dead. And with it is any semblance of faith this industry and culture can muster for it.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Press Freedom Coalition to FCC: Don't Ditch Checks on Corporate Media Consolidation

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. Brendan Carr, chair of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, delivers a speech during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain on March 3, 2025. The 16 groups urge the agency "to uphold its obligation to promote competition, localism, and diversity in the U.S. media." A coalition of 16 civil liberties, press freedom, and labor groups this week urged U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to abandon any plans to loosen media ownership restrictions and warned against opening the floodgates to further corporate consolidation. Public comments on the National Television Multiple Ownership Rule were due to the Federal Communications Commission by Monday—which is when the coalition wrote to the FCC about the 39% national audience reach cap for U.S. broadcast media conglomerates, and how more mergers could negatively impact "the independence of the nation's press and the vitality of its local journalism." "In our experience, the past 30 years of media consolidation have not fostered a better environment for local news and information. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 radically changed the radio and television broadcasting marketplace, causing rapid consolidation of radio station ownership," the coalition detailed. "Since the 1996 act, lawmakers and regulators have further relaxed television ownership limits, spurring further waves of station consolidation, the full harms of which are being felt by local newsrooms and the communities they serve." The coalition highlighted how this consolidation has spread "across the entire news media ecosystem, including newspapers, online news outlets, and even online platforms," and led to "newsroom layoffs and closures, and the related spread of 'news deserts' across the country." "Over a similar period, the economic model for news production has been undercut by technology platforms owned by the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta, which have offered an advertising model for better targeting readers, listeners, and viewers, and attracted much of the advertising revenue that once funded local journalism," the coalition noted. While "lobbyists working for large news media companies argue that further consolidation is the economic answer, giving them the size necessary to compete with Big Tech," the letter argues, "in fact, the opposite appears to be true." The letter points out that a recent analysis from Free Press—one of the groups that signed the letter—found a "pervasive pattern of editorial compromise and capitulation" at 35 of the largest media and tech companies in the United States, "as owners of massive media conglomerates seek to curry favor with political leadership." That analysis—released last week alongside a Media Capitulation Index—makes clear that "the interests of wealthy media owners have become so inextricably entangled with government officials that they've limited their news operations' ability to act as checks against abuses of political power," according to the coalition. In addition to warning about further consolidation and urging the FCC "to uphold its obligation to promote competition, localism, and diversity in the U.S. media," the coalition argued that the agency actually "lacks the authority to change the national audience reach cap," citing congressional action in 2004. Along with Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron, the letter is signed by leaders at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - Communications Workers of America, National Coalition Against Censorship, Local Independent Online News Publishers, Media Freedom Foundation, NewsGuild-CWA, Open Markets Institute, Park Center for Independent Media, Project Censored, Reporters Without Borders USA, Society of Professional Journalists, Tully Center for Free Speech, Whistleblower and Source Protection Program at ExposeFacts, and Writers Guild of America East and West. Free Press also filed its own comments. In a related Tuesday statement, senior economic and policy adviser S. Derek Turner, who co-authored the filing, accused FCC Chair Brendan Carr of "placing a for-sale sign on the public airwaves and inviting media companies to monopolize the local news markets as long as they agree to display political fealty to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement." "The price broadcast companies have to pay for consolidating further is bending the knee, and the line starts outside of the FCC chairman's office," said Turner. "Trump's autocratic demands seemingly have no bounds, and Carr apparently has no qualms about satisfying them. Carr's grossly partisan and deeply hypocritical water-carrying for Trump has already stained the agency, making it clear that this FCC is no longer independent, impartial, or fair."

Title: Restructuring Wondery: Amazon Exec Steve Boom on the Company’s Mission to Consolidate Podcasts and Focus on Celebrity-Led Titles

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor In a crowded market, stars shine brightest. This was Amazon’s guiding principle in the restructuring of its audio entertainment operations. The company’s decision to consolidate aspects of its Wondery podcasting division with its larger Audible audio book division surprised the podcasting sector when the news broke on Aug. 4. Audible has been part of Amazon since 2008. Wondery, launched in 2016 by entrepreneur Hernan Lopez, was acquired in late 2020. In the five years since, podcasting has exploded as a medium, seeing in particular a big boom in video-enhanced programming. That growth spurt spurred Amazon to make structural shifts at Wondery and Audible. Related Stories New James Bond Writer Steven Knight Says Franchise's Next Chapter Will Be 'Better and Stronger and Bolder': 'I Can't Wait to Get Started' Restructuring Wondery: Amazon Exec Steve Boom on the Company's Mission to Consolidate Podcasts and Focus on Celebrity-Led Titles “This was definitely a strategic decision,” Steve Boom, Amazon’s VP of audio, Twitch and games, tells Variety. “As we’ve seen how the market has evolved and how we need to best organize to address the market opportunity where we’re seeing the most success, it became pretty apparent to us over the last several months. This acceleration of video podcasting is really what prompted this restructuring.” Popular on Variety Boom says the moves were spurred by the clear bifurcation that Amazon audio leaders began to see in Wondery’s output. Many of the platform’s most popular titles fell into one of two broad categories: narrative-driven and personality-centric. Narrative titles tend to be deeply reported productions focused on true crime, history, pop culture, investigative reports and, increasingly, kid-centric shows. Personality-focused shows include such high-profile titles as Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert,” Travis and Jason Kelce’s “New Heights” and LeBron James’ upcoming “Mind the Game” series. Tom Webster, a partner in the podcast trade organization Sounds Profitable, says Amazon’s reorg is right in line with the larger trends in podcasting. “So much of the current narrative in podcasting is really being driven by video, even though most consumers spent most of their time with audio only,” Webster says. “But for the biggest shows, they want to see LeBron. They want to see the Kelce brothers.” Over time, Amazon brass realized that the two kinds of podcast required different approaches to development, marketing and audience retention support. With the restructuring, Wondery’s narrative titles will be added to the vast archive of programs available under Audible’s subscription platform. Wondery’s focus will turn to the care and feeding of its celebrity- and personality-fronted shows. “We’ve learned over time that the business models for these two different types of content are actually quite different,” Boom tells Variety. “On the one hand, the video-creator podcasts are monetizing incredibly well through advertising. It’s a very, very strong advertising business. In contrast, with the narrative podcasts, we’ve come to the conclusion that those are best monetized through a premium business model. And it turns out that we have in Amazon the leading company in the world in premium spoken word modernization. So we decided that if the best business model [for narrative shows] is premium, then it makes sense to bring these two things into one place where we can actually monetize them appropriately.” Wondery ranks high among the most popular podcast platforms in the country. But as the overall podcast marketplace became increasingly crowded in the post-pandemic years, Wondery looked to differentiate itself with both volume of production and starry names. More recently, ESPN and other networks are turning to video podcasts as low-cost content options that ideally become a daily or weekly habit with viewers. “Video has grown much more quickly than audio-only over the last two or three years. And within the video segment, you have some that are really premium in terms of production values and the quality of the talent and the guests on the shows,” Boom says. “So there’s more and more content out there to consume. Even though the overall audience for podcasting is growing, with that much growth in [the volume of] content, you have a very uneven environment where some shows are growing their audiences, others are flat and others are down.” Amazon’s audio tune-up will result in about 100 layoffs within Wondery. Many staffers will move to new positions within Amazon. Jen Sargent, who has been CEO of Wondery for the past four years, will exit the company after a transition period. Boom stresses that Sargent has been “a phenomenal leader,” for Wondery. “Sometimes the market changes, and you have to respond to those changes,” he added.

Title: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action Against iRobot Corporation and Certain Officers – IRBT

August 05, 2025 10:00 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

A pyrrhic victory When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's definitely been a trying year for Rare, but there is at least something to shout about for fans of the legendary Twycross-based developer in the form of a limited edition 8BitDo controller. This 8BitDo Ultimate controller for Xbox consoles and PC has been spotted over at Amazon (via Eurogamer), and is intended to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary. No release date has been revealed yet, and it seems like it'll only be available to US audiences at present. It's definitely one of the nicest limited edition 8BitDo controllers to date, featuring a blue and yellow color scheme reminiscent of the developer's logo. It's also emblazoned with iconography from some of its most renowned titles, including Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie. There's even a banana there as a cheeky nod to the Donkey Kong Country series as well as Donkey Kong 64. If you're unfamiliar with the 8BitDo controller, it's a bit of a revelation in the third-party gamepad space. It features Hall effect thumbsticks made to combat drift, two remappable buttons for secondary inputs, and a 2.4GHz dongle for wireless connectivity. The 8BitDo Ultimate also includes a charging dock in the box, for a clever and easy way to keep the pad topped up. I consider it to be one of the best Xbox controllers and best Nintendo Switch controllers on the market today. I can't help but feel bittersweet about the reveal of this controller, though. While Sea of Thieves is a tremendous game and continues to enjoy a dedicated player base, Rare's 40th year hasn't exactly been smooth-sailing. The developer's next game, Everwild, was recently canceled. This is in spite of comments from Xbox boss Phil Spencer back in February of this year, where he claimed the game's development was progressing. Rare also created the Perfect Dark series, an immersive sim-esque reboot of which was also shuttered along with its developer The Initiative amidst another round of Xbox Game Studios layoffs.

Title: Amazon restructures audio division with Wondery podcasts shift

Amazon made a big splash in the podcasting industry in early 2021 when it bought studio Wondery for a reported $300m. Four and a half years on, however, some changes are afoot. Bloomberg reported that Amazon is “breaking up” Wondery’s operations, splitting its shows and remaining team between the company’s Audible subsidiary and a new ‘creator services’ division. Remaining team? Yes, layoffs are part of this: around 110 people are losing their jobs according to the report, which painted the move as “an acknowledgement that Amazon’s big push into podcasts hasn’t worked out as planned”. This certainly isn’t Amazon giving up on podcasts, which are an increasingly-prominent part of its Amazon Music service, as well as featuring on Audible. The fact that Amazon Music, Audible and Twitch sit under the same umbrella within Amazon – overseen by VP of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom – hints at potential to do more in the sweet spot between podcasting, video and influencers. That’s something Spotify and YouTube are also both leaning heavily into in 2025.

Title: Amazon layoffs: 110 jobs to be cut as part of Wondery podcast studio overhaul

Amazon.com is restructuring the Wondery podcast studio by shifting its award-winning narrative podcasts such as "Business Wars" to Audible and consolidating creator-led shows into a new unit, according to a memo seen by Reuters. About 110 employees will be laid off as part of the process, while many Wondery employees will transition to other parts of Amazon, the company said in an emailed statement on Monday. Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will depart the company following a transition period, the memo said. Intense competition in the expensive podcast industry as well as a growing focus on creator-led video content have prompted audio streaming companies including Spotify to diversify their podcasts as they look to lower costs and attract more users to their platforms. "As video podcasting has grown in popularity, we have learned that creator-led, video-integrated shows have different audience needs and require distinct discovery, growth and monetization strategies compared to audio-first, narrative series," Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch and games at Amazon, wrote in the memo. Wondery was acquired by Amazon in 2021 and has seen podcast revenue quadruple since then as the studio expanded its slate to include video podcasts and creator-driven series, according to the memo. Under the new structure, Wondery's narrative podcast studio - home to shows such as "Dr. Death" and "American Scandal" - along with the Wondery subscription service, will move to Audible, the e-commerce giant's audio platform. Its creator-focused podcast team that produces shows including "Mind the Game", "New Heights", and "Armchair Expert" will join a new Creator Services group within Amazon's Talent Services division. This new team will continue to operate the creator-focused podcast studio under the Wondery brand. "By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels," Amazon said. Bloomberg News first reported on the Wondery overhaul.

By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Amazon is reorganizing its audio entertainment operations with plans to consolidate some of the production now done across its Wondery and Audible brands. As a result of the changes, Wondery CEO Jen Sargent is exiting her post after four years at the helm of one of the industry’s largest podcast studios. Amazon disclosed the changes with an internal memo from Steve Boom, who is VP of audio, Twitch and games for Amazon. The reorganization will include about 100 layoffs.

Popular on Variety Wondery podcasts that were more narrative-driven such as true crime favorites “Dr. Death” and “Dirty John” will now shift under the Audible brand, which encompasses original audio production as well as a vast audio book library. Amazon acquired Wondery in 2020. In a statement, Amazon positioned the changes as a streamlining of audio content across the comapny’s vast media footprint. “The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content. These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon,” Amazon said in a statement. “By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: EA Explains Why Fans Aren’t Getting The Sims 5

Dynasty WarriorsThe Sims 5Unions Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to The Sims 4? Why is Dynasty Warriors 3 objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at Kotaku experiment with reviving our old Morning Checkpoint roundup series that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first Call of Duty developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go! That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) told Variety when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. âWhat I wouldnât want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that youâve purchased over the years,â she said. âWe put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.â What fans are getting is a Sims movie with help from Barbie‘s Margot Robbie. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on Apex Legends. Quality assurance devs at Call of Duty support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union amid the 2021 workplace fallout, but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at Updater now reports that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao. Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is continuing to blaze through temperature records. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company posted. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5â35Â°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch back in 2022. Everything is going great, folks. Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the Dynasty WarriorsÂ series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary. Dynasty Warriors Origins, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. Dynasty Warriors 3, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games? Over 1 million people claimed the FreedomToBuy bundle from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, the storefront reports. It included Postal 2, Agony, Fetish Locator Week One, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io due to payment processors. The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when Metroid Prime 4 is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada near the end of August. A November release date is feeling more and more likely. Someone on Reddit found a leaked Amazon listing for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating the 40th anniversary of Rare, the studio best known for Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and Sea of Thieves, among other iconic classics.

Title: It's been a rough year for Rare but at least Xbox is celebrating its 40th anniversary with... a licensed controller

"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone." As Rare - known for the likes of Sea of Thieves, Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online. The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via reddit). The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the Amazon listing, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller. "A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life." Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below. Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment. This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business. "From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," it wrote, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below). "For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU." Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox. Everwild was first revealed in late 2019. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves. Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on Donkey Kong 64 and many more games - had left the studio after more than 35 years.

Title: Why Platforms Like Substack Won't Make Sense for Much Longer
URL: https://danielmiessler.com/blog/future-of-substack
Time Published: 2025-08-04T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I think the future of Substack is self-hosting. Or—more directly—I don't think they have much of a future. You've probably heard about Substack's issues—$585M valuation after failing to raise a Series C in 2022, the 14% staff layoffs, the major creator exodus in early 2024 over content moderation failures, and the fact that prominent writers like Casey Newton's Platformer jumped ship to competitors. Substack is showing all the classic warning signs of a dying platform (see below), but I care more about the fact that people had to go to Substack in the first place, and that they're now unhappy. To me it's part of a larger issue with the platforms in general. I've been blogging since 1999 and I've seen a few dozen of these platforms over the years. I've probably used nearly a dozen myself. I think the reason these platforms fail after a limited run is because they tend to toxify over time. I think, fundamentally, it's just hard to have a giant platform like this where the incentives can stay aligned with its users. So there are two main paths: Here's a not-even-comprehensive list of the platforms and why they're no longer around. Why it failed: Acquired by Twitter, then shut down Twitter acquired for talent, not product. Couldn't compete with Tumblr's growth. Shut down April 30, 2013. Peak: 4.5M monthly users. Why it failed: Lack of revenue, couldn't compete with Twitter Too complex (tried to combine microblogging, file sharing, events). Acquired by Six Apart and immediately shut down Dec 2008. Only had ~100k users at peak. Why it failed: Low engagement, poor features Microsoft auto-created accounts for all 500M Hotmail users but only 30M were active. Migrated to WordPress.com Sept 2010. Why it failed: Financial difficulties Pioneered blogging but couldn't afford servers. Shut down Feb 2014 after data loss. Relaunched 2018 as subscription-only. Why it failed: Legal battle (Hulk Hogan lawsuit) $140M verdict in lawsuit funded by Peter Thiel. Filed bankruptcy, shut down Aug 2016. Relaunched 2021 but minimal traffic. Why it failed: NSFW ban, cultural mismatch with Yahoo/VerizonLost 30% of traffic after Dec 2018 adult content ban. Sold by Yahoo for $1.1B (2013), later sold to Automattic for less than $3M (2019). Why it failed: Failed to gain traction Six Apart's attempt at "neighborhood blogging." Never exceeded 600k users. Shut down Sept 30, 2010. Why it failed: Still alive but stagnant under Google Acquired by Google 2003. Last major update 2020. Lost 90%+ market share to WordPress. Many features deprecated. Why it failed: Sold to Russian company, user exodusSold to SUP Media (Russia) 2007. Servers moved to Russia 2016, triggering privacy concerns and mass exodus. Why it failed: Failed to evolve, lost to Facebook/MySpace Peak: 40M users (2005). Shut down 2013, raised $60k to relaunch as "Xanga 2.0." Now basically dead. Why it struggles: Revenue model conflicts with customer needs Multiple layoffs: 2017 (50 people), 2021 (75), 2023 (unknown). Changed business model 5+ times. Major publications left platform. Why it failed: Failed to grow beyond niche Started as invite-only "elite" network. Opened to public 2014 but too late. No meaningful updates since. Estimated <10k active users. Why it failed: Struggles with mainstream adoptionRaised $5M+ via Kickstarter/revenue. Only ~2.5k paying Ghost(Pro) customers despite being around 10+ years. $200+/month pricing drives users to competitors. Why it failed: Lost creators to self-hosting While WordPress.org powers 43% of the web, WordPress.com has <0.4% market share. Creators graduate to self-hosted after hitting limitations. Why it failed: Creator exodus, content moderation crisisPlatformer, Casey Newton left Jan 2024 over Nazi content. Flat $585M valuation after failed Series C (2022). 14% layoffs June 2022. Top writers leaving to avoid 10% fee. Currently growing (benefiting from competitor issues) Founded by Morning Brew alumni. Raised $33M Series B at $192M valuation (Apr 2024). 100k+ newsletters, grew 10x in 2023. Flat pricing beats Substack's %. These seem to be some of the themes. So there's this massive history of these platforms rising up to consume the users fleeing the previous failure. Only to then fall apart themselves years later. Another way to make this point might be to ask why we needed these platforms in the first place? Why were there so many of these? And why did they do so well for so long? It's because individual writers couldn't do one or more of the following: Well, it's now a whole lot easier to do all three. Creating a website that hosts a blog is fairly trivial for AI today, and it will only become more trivial in the months and years to come. So any would-be writer can simply have AI help build them a blog. And it won't even have to look exactly like all the other pages, which is a problem on a site like Substack, who wants to maintain its own branding above that of the creator. Sending mass emails is still a bit of a dark art, but there are services like Amazon SES that AI could also use to build this infrastructure fairly easily. Not to mention using any of the other third-party services that are designed to help people do this. It just becomes a matter of integration with those tools, which AI is really good at. And finally, the benefit of a platform for getting eyes onto your content I think is diminishing as well. First of all, it's not clear to me that anyone on Substack is just getting tons of traffic by virtue of just being there. Second, I think sites like Google and other AI-powered platforms are going to get extremely good at finding the content jewels of what's publicly available and raising them up to others. Basically, AI-powered content discovery. And I think that will have far more impact at lifting the best content. The bottom line is, we're just going to be able to do these things on our own. The platforms tend to be extremely toxic and highly restrictive, and they don't last long anyway. And the only reason they existed in the first place is because it was hard to do the things that they provided. And now with AI, that is all going away.

Title: The Day MOOCs Died: Coursera's Preview Mode Kills Free Learning
URL: https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-preview-mode-paywall/

Your source for the latest news and trends in online education. Disclosure: Class Central is learner-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn without limits* (*some limits, like seeing the actual course, may apply). Last week, Coursera’s new CEO, Greg Hart, delivered something the company’s investors had been eagerly awaiting: growth. In his first full quarter as CEO, Greg’s leadership helped drive Coursera’s stock price up 36% following the earnings call, pushing the company’s valuation past the $2 billion mark. However, this pursuit of prioritizing Wall Street could come at a cost to learners worldwide. The company is rolling out a “Preview Mode,” a feature that would lock almost all course content, including video lectures. Coursera formally launched in January 2012 with the mission statement: “We are committed to making the best education in the world freely available to any person who seeks it.” At that time, Coursera had no business model. Over the years, Coursera gradually introduced monetization features, including certificates, specializations, and subscription plans, while placing certificates and graded assignments behind paywalls. This transition is detailed in my article, Coursera’s Monetization Journey: From Zero to IPO. During the Jeff Maggioncalda era (June 2017 to early 2025), Coursera maintained a relatively stable free auditing policy. Under his leadership, learners retained access to video content for most courses, even as certificates and graded assignments required payment. While competitors like edX and FutureLearn implemented time-based paywalls, restricting all course content, Coursera largely resisted this approach, keeping video lectures accessible to non-paying users. That appears to be changing under new leadership. In early July, while attempting to enroll in Programming Languages I from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, I encountered a significant change: the course was completely locked, with only Module 1 accessible. When I consulted with my Classmates (that’s what we call each other at Class Central), they reported full access to the same course, minus the graded assignments. This inconsistency suggested that Preview Mode was in limited testing. I reached out to my network familiar with this matter and confirmed that Preview Mode is real and will be deployed across the platform. What remains unclear is the extent of this deployment. What percentage of courses will be affected? Will universities have the option to opt out? Will it be limited to certain geographic regions? Class Central will be closely monitoring these developments. Courses that have offered free video access for years, some for over a decade, may soon become restricted. This represents a fundamental shift from a model that had been stable for years. I dread to think of all the places and different articles we published on Class Central that need to be updated. After failing to boost the stock price through layoffs and stock buybacks, Coursera replaced its long-time CEO with Amazon veteran Greg Hart. In Hart’s first full quarter as CEO, he raised Coursera’s 2025 revenue outlook by $17 million, projecting a range of $738 million to $746 million. During the earnings call, CFO Ken Hahn attributed the current quarter’s growth to “strong receptivity to our Coursera Plus subscription offerings and marketing campaigns, including localized promotions and pricing that benefited our paid conversion rate.” This likely translates to increased discounting (a recent Coursera trend) and geographic pricing adjustments that reduce costs in countries with lower purchasing power. While this represents only a 2% increase in annual revenue, Wall Street responded dramatically: Coursera’s stock price surged 36%. In other words, a modest 2% revenue boost made Coursera’s investors and employees half a billion dollars richer overnight. Hart indicated the additional $17 million will come from the consumer business, which he described as having “a more responsive model.” This suggests Coursera can adjust pricing strategies more aggressively to maximize revenue, and the upcoming Preview Mode rollout is part of this approach. Previously when MOOC providers implemented paywalls, it was done in the guise of sustainability. Yet Coursera’s financials tell a different story. The company has never been stronger financially, generating $29 million in free cash flow last quarter alone while maintaining $775 million in cash reserves. This move appears to be designed primarily to boost a stock price that, despite the recent surge, remains 73% below its IPO level. In many ways, yes. Major platforms stopped using the term “MOOC” to describe their courses years ago. The term had been fading, a decline accelerated by 2U’s acquisition of edX and subsequent bankruptcy. FutureLearn’s acquisition by Global University Systems further consolidated the market. This left Coursera as the last major independent player — the largest platform and the one with the most generous free access policy. MOOCs never achieved the transformative potential promised during the early hype. The movement lost its way as monetization increasingly took precedence over accessibility. When I built Class Central as a side project over Thanksgiving weekend in 2011, my goal was simply to track free online courses from Stanford. Throughout the years, I believed Coursera had preserved some of the original MOOC spirit by maintaining free access to course content. With Preview Mode’s implementation, that spirit finally dies. MOOCs, as originally conceived, are now truly dead. About Class Central In a world where late capitalism is been overturned by techno feudalism, is not a surprise that MOOC – Coursera’s Preview Mode Kills the Free Learning!! We are the serfs that have to pay for everything for simply existing, any change that we could have to accumulate knowledge, capital or influence will be restrained by the rentier’s Lords of the Clouds/internet. Last attempt to post my comment: This was forseeable after Coursera announced their new CEO. Greg Hart was a sales person at Amazon, and for a sales person is money the first and the only thing which is important. Coursera decided to go the edX and FutureLearn way, and shift to a shareholder value policy. It will be interesting what Coursera´s University partners think about these steps, and what are their next steps regarding the partnership. In general i agree with your view Dhawal, the MOOCS as they invented are dead, forever. Cancel Δ This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.

Title: How To Collect Dividends Up To 11% From Tech Stocks

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Nasdaq has been rallying nonstop since April. Let’s discuss three covered call fund payouts up to 11.2% that play the rally. The catalyst is the “rise of the machines” with companies replacing expensive humans with cheaper robots and AI tools. Hiring numbers are down and (paradoxically to some) the Nasdaq continues to levitate higher. This summer heater in tech stocks is no surprise to us contrarians. The Naz tech giants are enjoying expanding profit margins! Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company’s workforce will shrink, replaced by AI. This is bad for those who work at Amazon, but great for those who own AMZN. Microsoft (MSFT) also announced big layoffs in recent months, especially in sales and support roles easily handled by AI-driven tools. And my friends at Alphabet (GOOG) are looking over their shoulders wondering how much longer their services will be needed. This is a dicey time to be a rank-and-file tech bro—but an exciting time to be a tech savvy dividend investor. Here are three “one-click” (or one-tap) dividend plays on this megatrend! Alphabet (GOOG) will never pay 11.2%. But we can buy GOOG and the rest of Big Tech for 11.2% payouts via a fund like Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD), which sells (“writes”) covered call funds on the Naz index itself to generate additional income. QYLD buys the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 and simultaneously writes covered calls on the index itself to generate income—which it pays out monthly. It’s not perfect exposure to technology. The Nasdaq-100 is made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange, and in fact, it includes stocks from 10 different sectors. However, it’s still tech-heavy, at 60% of the index’s weight, and includes trillion-dollar tech firms like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), so it’s generally treated as a proxy for the sector. But that’s a marginal consideration. The real tradeoff to weigh is tactical. By selling covered calls against the Nasdaq, we’re sacrificing potential upside in return for a.) much more stability and b.) the very high income from the options premiums it collects. QYLD will rarely outperform the “QQQs” to the upside. But it also has less downside exposure, thanks to the constant income it generates by selling the call options. The JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income (JEPQ) uses a similar strategy, owning roughly 100 or so Nasdaq stocks while selling calls against the Nasdaq-100. It also doles out its massive dividend in monthly distributions. But it’s a little more flexible because of a big difference between it and QYLD: management. Whereas QYLD tracks an index and typically has only one options position at any given moment, JEPQ is led by 38-year veteran Hamilton Reiner and a team of four co-managers who can sell multiple contracts. I’ve also pointed out in the past that while both funds hold pretty much the same stocks, JEPQ is more heavily weighted in mega-cap names than QYLD. But that’s not by definition. Indeed, today, JEPQ has a smaller percentage of assets invested in each of its top 10 holdings than QYLD. These might not seem like meaningful differences, but over time we see that JPMorgan’s “homemade” strategy beat QYLD’s straightforward approach. Active management can make a world of difference—so much so that I typically prefer closed-end funds (CEFs) over comparable ETFs. Let’s walk over to the CEF side of the border to review our final call writer. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is a CEF, while QYLD and JEPQ are ETFs. But the differences go far beyond fund type. Paul Wick, who has nearly four decades of experience, and a team of five other managers run a slimmer portfolio of about 55 holdings. The portfolio is also a purer—though not pure—play on technology, with about 70% of assets dedicated to the sector. STK also is interested in “growth at a reasonable price” (GARP); a relatively more value-priced portfolio shows it, with price-to-earnings, sales, book, and cash flow all lower than the other ETFs. And whereas QYLD tries to own Nasdaq-100 stocks (and while JEPQ has a broader mandate but looks index-esque in its larger holdings), STK is much more willing to take some shots—stocks such as Lam Research (LRCX) and industrial Bloom Energy (BE) punch well above their weight. Columbia Seligman’s CEF writes covered calls, too—typically on the Nasdaq-100, but again, it has more flexibility. For instance, right now, management is selling Apple calls, too. The strategy works. In fact, it works mighty well. STK still has its drawbacks. Unlike other covered-call funds, Columbia Seligman’s fund is actually more volatile than the Nasdaq, not less. Moreover, while the ETFs pay monthly, this CEF is only paying us on a quarterly schedule—and at current prices (which admittedly represent a slight discount to net asset value), it’s paying us just half as much as JEPQ and QYLD.

Title: Big Tech has cut over 100,000 jobs this year — and the AI revolution is just getting started

Since the start of the year, Big Tech has shed over 100,000 jobs. Sure, some of these layoffs are just standard corporate belt tightening, but it is now clear that AI is impacting the job market — and entry- and mid-level workers are being hit the hardest. This underscores a defining question of our time: Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities and industries that we can’t yet imagine? So far, AI is displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created. The displacement of workers through automation is nothing new. Emerging technologies upend legacy companies and industries, and usher in new organizations with better jobs with higher pay. It’s a cycle that’s been dubbed “creative destruction” by economist Joseph Schumpeter. Throughout history, that has meant short-term pain for long-term gain — at least for some. On the one hand, the automobile put farriers and stage-coach drivers out of business but created millions of good-paying jobs for automotive assembly workers and truck drivers. On the other, the internet replaced many department-store clerks, travel agents, taxi drivers and journalists with Amazon fulfillment center workers, Uber drivers, content creators and others who often work more hours for less pay with fewer benefits. And in the Rust Belt and factory towns, automation has eliminated countless workers with no obvious replacement in sight. The disruption from AI could make this look like kids’ stuff. Historically, technology has automated workers at the periphery — those with low skills that can easily be substituted. AI will automate everything, everywhere, all at once, displacing knowledge workers and managers in every industry. Ironically, tradespeople like welders, electricians, plumbers and carpenters who were told “learn to code” may be the last to get automated away. Already, engineers at Amazon are complaining that their role has been degraded as they’re asked to do more with AI. There is an added concern that AI will kill many careers before they begin. In a recent interview with Axios, Dario Amodei, CEO of AI darling Anthropic, said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs — and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years. A LinkedIn executive echoed this sentiment in a recent New York Times essay with the alarming title “The bottom rung of the career ladder is breaking,” citing at-risk entry-level jobs such as paralegals and call center operators. Tech CEOs seem unfussed by the potential of a looming cataclysm — if anything, they’re doing what they can to usher it in. Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan this year that AI will replace most of Meta’s mid-level engineers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that AI already writes 30% of the company’s code. In the last few months, Microsoft has fired more than 15,000 people. Shareholders are rewarding executives that adopt AI and slash headcount: Microsoft’s stock just hit an all time high. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. Not all tech workers are suffering. In fact, a few super-engineers are reaping unprecedented windfalls from the AI revolution, commanding pay packages of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and stock that would make hedge-fund managers or superstar athletes blush. As he’s musing about mass cuts to his workforce to Rogan, Zuckerberg is also poaching the top AI minds from competitors like OpenAI and Apple with eye-popping pay packages. Ruoming Pang was lured away from Apple with an offer worth $200 million — triple what Apple CEO Tim Cook made last year. Is AI exposing yet another fault line between haves and have-nots? Is this a harbinger of what we can come to expect from an AI economy? So far AI has created huge wealth for founders, investors and the top 0.01% of tech talent. But what about the rest of us? This goes beyond business with implications for governments and society. President Trump initially rose to popularity by tapping into the anger and fears of an aging blue-collar work force who felt left behind by globalization and automation. He sustained his appeal by broadening his coalition to include a more diverse and younger part of the electorate, namely Gen Z men, who are among the most at-risk groups when it comes to being replaced by AI. An economy where young people can’t find work could deepen Gen Z’s economic pessimism into existential nihilism. New technologies are always greeted with a mixture of hope, trepidation and outright pessimism. Ultimately, technology has no agency. It is not morally good or bad. It is a tool, created and wielded by people. Human beings learned to make fire, and cook food, stay warm and clear land for agriculture — or burn down a rival’s hut.

Title: TCS layoffs: Is efficiency the new growth strategy?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. On 27 June, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) made headlines when it announced plans to cut approximately 12,000 jobs, marking the largest layoff in the software services major’s history. The move sparked debate, with some industry observers interpreting it as fallout from artificial intelligence (AI), and warning of similar cuts at other major firms. However, TCS chief executive K. Krithivasan attributed the decision to skill mismatches, not AI. Days later, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said his company remained committed to hiring 20,000 freshers in FY26. The contrasting statements suggested that the layoffs were likely tied to TCS’s internal restructuring rather than indicative of an industry-wide trend. Still, the sector hasn’t resolved the structural challenges that have built up over the past few years. Investor confidence in IT stocks has eroded significantly from a year ago. While major companies have delivered strong returns over five years, their stock prices have declined over the past year—falling further in 2025 and trailing the BSE Sensex’s modest 3% year-to-date gain. Much of the market pessimism stems from softening demand in key Western markets, where clients are tightening budgets while AI capabilities expand. This has forced the industry to focus heavily on cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Major IT players have dramatically reduced their workforce—TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra together employ 56,000 fewer people now than they did two years ago. Western pressuresSome of this drive comes from the sector’s peers in the West. A worldwide efficiency push has driven massive tech layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies eliminated over 80,000 positions in the first half of 2025 alone, following 152,000 cuts in 2024 and 264,000 in 2023. This restructuring wave, spearheaded by industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, has established new investor benchmarks for operational efficiency across the sector. But Indian IT services companies face a different challenge. They can't simply slash costs as product companies do, since revenue depends on billable hours. At the same time, their enterprise clients are reportedly demanding 20-30% price cuts, citing expected AI-driven productivity. Also Read | Three years on, AI is prompting IT companies to cut workforce The reality is more tempered. Parekh, for instance, recently told the Times of India that AI and automation are currently yielding productivity gains of only 5–15%. This mismatch between client expectations and actual impact is prompting firms to seek savings elsewhere. Client squeezePart of the efficiency drive is also rooted in sluggish demand. On TCS’s latest earnings call, Krithivasan observed that decision-making delays and project deferrals for discretionary investments had persisted and worsened through the June quarter. Workforce reductions over the past two years have enabled TCS and other tier-I firms to sustain or enhance revenue per employee, a critical performance metric for these companies. While leading IT services companies have stagnated, growth has been driven by global capability centres (the in-house tech hubs of multinational companies) and smaller players. GCC revenues expanded by 40% in FY24 alone. Nasscom projected earlier this year that revenues of GCCs in FY25 would roughly match IT service exports, with the total industry headcount growing by 126,000 to reach 5.8 million in FY25, up from 5.58 million in FY23. Efficiency driveIn effect, IT services majors that once powered the sector’s employment boom are now prioritizing profitability over headcount growth. Margins across leading firms have come under pressure, as pricing constraints and intensifying competition weigh on the sector. TCS, which has consistently reported the highest margins among peers, also made the boldest restructuring move—underscoring how central efficiency will be in the years ahead.

In a market where demand may return but pricing remains tight, efficiency will be key to success.

The layoffs have triggered legal and social pushback. Karnataka’s IT employees’ union has filed an industrial dispute against TCS, alleging illegal retrenchment.
