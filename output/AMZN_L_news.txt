Feedback The job market for MBA graduates has reached a critical juncture, sparking conversations across social media and beyond. A post by CA Nitin Kaushik on X, using the handle @Finance_Bareek, captured the sentiment perfectly: “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees ₹25,00,000, ROI: Uncertain. Research before enrolling.” Kaushik’s post resonates with a growing number of MBA aspirants and professionals grappling with the changing realities of the job market. The issue isn’t confined to India; even graduates from elite institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Wharton are feeling the squeeze. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚: MBA fees: ₹25,00,000 ROI: Uncertain Research before enrolling. 🎓💡#stockmarketcrash #niftycrash #financetips #investingbehaviour The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently reported that 23% of Harvard Business School’s 2024 MBA graduates were jobless three months after graduation. This number has more than doubled since 2022 when it stood at 10%. Other top-tier schools like Stanford and Wharton have seen similar dips, with unemployment rates hovering around 20%. The issue isn’t just limited to the US. According to the International Labor Organisation’s Global Employment Trends for Youth 2024, 13% of the global youth labour force was unemployed in 2023—a figure representing nearly 65 million people. Why are MBAs struggling? Despite boasting median starting salaries exceeding $175,000, MBA graduates are finding it harder to land jobs due to shifting hiring practices. Consulting firms like McKinsey and BCG, alongside tech giants such as Google and Amazon, have drastically reduced MBA hires amid widespread layoffs and economic slowdowns. Post-pandemic structural changes have also left companies preferring smaller, highly skilled teams. The rise of AI and automation further compounds the issue, making generalist MBA degrees less appealing compared to targeted certifications and boot camps. Kristen Fitzpatrick, who oversees career development at Harvard Business School, put it bluntly: “Going to Harvard is not going to be a differentiator.” Instead, companies are now focusing on technical and specialized skills. How MBA Education Needs to Evolve To address these challenges, institutions are pivoting toward innovative solutions. Harvard is testing an AI tool to match graduates with jobs and suggest courses to bridge skill gaps. Some graduates have found success by lowering their expectations and opting for less conventional roles, according to Forbes. One thing is clear—degrees alone won’t cut it anymore. The future belongs to professionals who continuously upskill to meet the ever-changing demands of the workforce. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: The Scoop: As Trump admin flexes muscle, Target retreats from DEI

Target is the latest national brand to announce plans to roll back long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a memo to employees, Target announced plans to end its three-year DEI goals and stop reporting to external groups focused on diversity, such as the Human Rights Campaign. The memo noted that Target will no longer support an internal program aimed at carrying more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses. These changes won’t lead to any layoffs, CNBC reported. But it’s already impacting the ways Target is interacting with the community. “Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,” Kiera Fernandez, chief community impact and equity officer at Target, wrote in the memo. “And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future – all in service of driving Target’s growth and winning together.” Target is certainly not alone in its decision-making. Companies such as Tractor Supply, Walmart, Meta and McDonald’s have also scaled back or stopped their DEI commitments amid growing political and societal pressures. Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump ended the government’s DEI programs and placed federal officials in charge of those initiatives on leave. But not all companies are following this trend. For example, Costco recently voted overwhelmingly to continue supporting its DEI programs, with over 98% of shareholders rejecting a proposal to review its DEI risks. Why it matters: This is a moment of sea change as monumental as what we saw when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and organizations across the country adopted DEI measures as a way of addressing historical inequities in business. To be clear, these changes have been evolving for some time, with a variety of companies slowly scaling back DEI efforts. Then came the Supreme Court decision rolling back affirmative action, which gave some legal cover for halting these programs. Then came societal pressure from activists including Robbie Starbuck. Then, with the election of Donald Trump, the pressures moved from cultural to governmental, with the feds threatening to investigate companies engaging in DEI in ways it deems “illegal.” This is a delicate moment that requires careful balancing. This is not an issue any one department or communicator can tackle. Legal, HR, internal and external communications must all collaborate to determine what is legal, what is just and how those items should be communicated. Target and Costco are one example of companies handling this very differently. Target, which had already been the target of anti-LGBTQ+ protests, retreated from DEI. Costco stood in its principles. Behind each decision, surely, were many agonized conversations, disagreements and lawyers. Your role as a communicator is to be the voice of your audiences. To show the data on their needs and how that may impact the business. This will be a difficult moment regardless of what your organization decides to do. Listen. Advocate in the best interests of the organization and your audiences. That sometimes is the more important role than any official statement.

Title: Trump’s RTO edict raises concerns over morale, efficiency — and burnout
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808863/trumps-rto-edict-raises-concerns-over-morale-efficiency-and-burnout.html

President Donald J. Trump’s executive order to federal employees to return to the office “as soon as practicable” will have a variety of repercussions — most of them negative, according to industry analysts and others. The return-to-office (RTO) policy issued last week signals Trump’s intent to fulfill campaign promises to reform the 2.3-million-strong federal workforce, which he has criticized as inefficient and bloated. The language in Trump’s order doesn’t clarify whether it applies only to the estimated 10% of federal civilian workers — about 228,000 as of May 2024 — who work remotely full-time, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Trump may be upping the stakes, but then-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed legislation Jan. 5 designed to bring more federal employees back to the office and increase the efficiency of office space utilization. Both men were likely taking cues from various businesses that have instituted RTO mandates in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Tesla and SpaceX chief executive CEO Elon Musk — now a close advisor to Trump — delivered an RTO ultimatum to his two companies’ white-collar workers: get back in the corporate office or face firing. Musk’s letter to executive staff at the time specified: “The office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” Other corporations have followed suit more recently. In December, Amazon and AT&T ended their work-from-home policies. AT&T went so far as to tell 9,000 of its 149,000 workers to relocate to an office area or be fired. Peter Miscovich, managing director at global real estate firm JLL, said the US is entering a “hybrid winter,” as many CEOs impose RTO mandates that could pose talent attraction and retention challenges for leading IT organizations. That’s especially true for advanced tech leadership teams and IT departments that have built sophisticated hybrid work practices over time and invested significantly in hybrid operational technologies and related infrastructure across global organizations, he said. “Perhaps the most significant risk associated with RTO mandates is the potential loss of valuable and critical IT digital talent,” Miscovich said. “The IT tech sector has embraced hybrid work more thoroughly than most industries, and IT professionals now view hybrid workplace flexibility as a standard expectation for the workforce rather than a perk.” Over the past two or so years, remote work — once praised as the new paradigm for productivity and employee satisfaction — began losing some of its luster as more organizations required workers to get back to their cubicles, at least part time. In fact, many organizations are already struggling to fill a significant IT talent gap. In some cases, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has been able to replace needed workers; in most other instances, the dearth of tech talent remains. According to new research from the University of Pittsburgh, S&P 500 companies that rolled out RTO mandates experienced “abnormally high” employee turnover and longer time-to-hire when filling job vacancies. “This significant IT digital talent brain-drain risk is particularly acute given the current competitive market for technology talent,” Miscovich said. In 2025, CIOs and senior IT leaders face growing challenges when trying to attract top talent while maintaining operational excellence and managing workplace transformation amid RTO mandates, according to Miscovich. Resistance to the mandates is especially strong in global IT departments where hybrid and remote work are deeply integrated and have proven highly effective. John Veitch, dean of the School of Business and Management at Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, California, said RTO mandates are “generally” a sign of insecure leadership. In other words, executives don’t trust what they can’t see. RTO mandates say, “I have to see people working and earning their living,” he said. Veitch didn’t have strong feelings either way about RTOs involving the federal government workers, though from a workflow point of view, he said he’s not convinced there are benefits. He agreed that with the tech marketplace unemployment rate near historic lows, it could push some workers out the door, he said. “I don’t think the federal government pays particularly well relative to what you can get if you’re a top-flight technologist at a Silicon Valley firm,” Veitch said. “Obviously, people who have options will choose those options, particularly if return-to-office is a deal breaker for them. So, I don’t think it’s going to help the government in any way, shape or form to retain talented people.” Further research points to other problems with RTO mandates. Being in the office five days a week leads to higher rates of burnout, lower morale, and inefficiencies associated with commuting time, according to J. P. Gownder, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. On average, US workers spend 2.3 days in the office each week, according to a Stanford University study. A separate Stanford study found that hybrid work had zero effect on workers’ productivity or career advancement and dramatically boosted retention rates. In general, hybrid working arrangements hold numerous advantages over full-time, in-office, Gownder said, and for non-collaborative work, home offices are far better suited because they create “a focused environment.” “Despite some managers’ concerns, employees who work in hybrid fashion are more productive than those who spend all their time in the office. Most employees engage in a mix of personal and collaborative work,” he said. In fact, hybrid work boosts employee productivity, performance, and retention, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford. Because of RTO mandates, employees are often forced to commute in only to do tasks they could handle at home. Even in the office, many still rely on videoconferencing to collaborate with colleagues in other locations. As a result of that and other inconveniences, organizations that move from hybrid work to full-time in-office work can expect higher attrition rates, Gownder argued. “Sometimes, managers impose these policies specifically to drive higher attrition, in lieu of layoffs,” he said. “IT talent often can work effectively remotely, and attrition rates in general are higher among IT professionals.” Additionally, the federal government and private companies have a dramatically smaller number of offices to which they could return as many companies have consolidated their footprints to a few key hubs. AT&T, for example, ordered 60,000 managers to work from one of only nine offices, forcing 9,000 employees to relocate or resign. As the pandemic eased in 2022 and 2023, US core business centers in large and small cities continued to suffer the after-effects of remote- and hybrid-work policies, which led to a 20% to 40% reduction in office space use and a devaluation of properties. The big switch to remote work left many downtowns largely empty for months. Data indicates that approximately 80% of offices had downsized by the end of 2023. Other sources indicate the downsizing slowed last year and by Q4 2024 office leasing rates were at about 92% of pre-pandemic levels, according to David Brodeur-Johnson, employee experience research lead at Forrester Research. “And yes, I believe that firms would be willing to expand their office spaces as needed to keep up with capacity, but most aren’t there yet,” he said. While most organizations adopted a hybrid-work policies, requiring employees to be in the office a few days each week while allowing work from home on other days, the Trump Administration’s policies are a strict, five-day RTO. That’s likely to incur an employee backlash, Brodeur-Johnson said. The federal government, he said, risks employee disengagement more than attrition. Monitoring federal employee surveys like FedRamp will be crucial, as disengagement is costly for both employees and employers. “It’s important to bear in mind also that autonomy is a primary source of intrinsic motivation — the kind that comes from within — so I would argue strongly that the biggest negative impact will likely be to employee engagement instead of attrition,” Brodeur-Johnson said. Academic studies also show that strong social relationships are key to remote work success, with emotional closeness outweighing physical distance. But simply being in the office doesn’t promote social relationships, Brodeur-Johnson pointed out. “Which is why companies like Nvidia have left it up to employees to decide, up to and including fully remote work,” he said. “How close people feel to each other emotionally is far more important than physical distance.” While Trump’s executive order could spark a wider look at RTO edicts elsewhere, most private companies have settled on what their employees will tolerate. Meanwhile, federal agencies have steadily increased in-office requirements, so the latest change shouldn’t be a surprise, Brodeur-Johnson said. But for some workers — especially those with care-giving duties or better flexible job options — it could be the tipping point. Top talent might leave first, which is why RTO mandates have slowed recently, he said. Senior Reporter Lucas Mearian covers AI in the enterprise, Future of Work issues, healthcare IT and FinTech.

Title: Playing To Win: The Pros And Cons Of Workplace Competition
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/26/workplace-competition-pros-cons/
Time Published: 2025-01-26T21:30:00Z

Workplace competition has pros and cons. Workplace competition is inevitable in a corporate environment with an inherent pressure to outperform peers. Whether vying for promotions or bonuses, employees are in a constant race to climb the corporate ladder. Many organizations foster a competitive spirit in the hopes of driving productivity and innovation. When encouraged in the proper way, workplace competition can be beneficial. Yet, that same tactic can backfire if unhealthy rivalries result in a negative or hostile work environment. Competition in the office is more widespread than most people think. In a survey by ResumeLab, over 80% of respondents admit to experiencing workplace competition. While the majority (69.6%) describe the competition with co-workers as being healthy, just over 30% feel the competition is toxic. Co-workers who are considered healthy competition are referred to as “positive rivals.” The research revealed that employees with a positive rival are twice as likely than those with a negative rival to believe their organization creates an environment of healthy competition. Whether workplace competition results in a positive or negative experience depends on how leaders motivate employees. When competition makes employees feel excited, it can induce creative behaviors. On the other hand, if it causes workers to feel anxious and fearful, it could lead to unethical actions. Let’s review the pros and cons of workplace competition and how to create a balanced culture that generates positive outcomes. Fostering healthy workplace competition can boost employee engagement. For example, creating fun contests can help keep workers motivated. When your team feels inspired, they will work harder and be more productive. Competition also encourages people to learn new skills and go outside the scope of their roles. They feel challenged, which often contributes to greater performance. When that happens, it’s also easier for managers to identify individuals who display the leadership and initiative to be considered for promotions. Encouraging a competitive environment at work can drive creativity and team innovation. When the pressure to outperform peers builds, workers are motivated to think outside the box and strive for excellence. In a competitive workplace, the desire to innovate is constant. As a result, pursuing fresh ideas often leads to breakthroughs that might not occur in a strictly collaborative setting. Companies like Google, Amazon and Tesla are examples of organizations where workplace competition has been known to drive transformation and increase efficiency. When managed properly, workplace competition can generate higher-quality work output. The competitive environment helps guide employees to drive toward a goal. Their desire to outperform co-workers increases their focus and motivates them to pursue excellence. As teams put in more effort to impress their managers, work quality increases. If workplace competition is focused on negative outcomes, like the threat of layoffs or being publicly humiliated, it can create a toxic environment. Depending on the individual, the stress and anxiety associated with excessive competition can also breed hostility and negatively impact mental health. Finally, intense competitiveness can erode team unity as employees focus more on individual success than what will benefit the organization as a whole. When competitiveness at work results in a distrustful environment, collaboration is discouraged. Another downside is that some team members might perceive the competition as unfair, which can bring about conflicts. New employees, in particular, may feel discouraged if they think the expectations are unreasonable. When team members distrust leadership, it can result in disengagement over time. Depending on the individual, a highly competitive work environment can cause some people to act dishonestly. For example, if a sales executive is feeling the pressure to reach virtually impossible targets, they might sabotage a colleague’s work or manipulate data. When workplace competition becomes too intense, employees might even take credit for other people’s work to achieve a better performance review. Ultimately, these negative behaviors damage the company’s long-term reputation and team morale. Workplace competition can be a double-edged sword. While it sometimes motivates employees, it can also have the opposite effect. According to a study published in Harvard Business Review, the determining factor is how employees respond emotionally. If they interpret their feelings as anxiety, they are more likely to behave unethically. Yet, when they feel excited, they are apt to leverage creative behaviors to problem-solve. Fundamentally, how workplace competition makes people feel plays a crucial role in how they try to succeed. By leading with a positive attitude, managers can maintain a competitive spirit that makes employees feel nurtured and valued. One Community. Many Voices.

UPDATED 12:11 EST / JANUARY 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and new territory. In this Breaking Analysis, we put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. Every year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and we categorize them. The picture below gives you a sense of how many inbound predictions we review. Each year the folder gets larger. Below we show the change in topic areas over the past three years. Remarkably, artificial intelligence, while still prominent, was second this year after cybersecurity. Now in fairness, many of the security predictions involved AI, but it’s notable that generative AI last year propelled AI to the top category with 40% of the inbounds and cyber, which dropped as a percentage of the total last year, has shot back to regain the top spot it held in 2023. As well, cloud and data center grew after last year’s decline and, surprisingly, data continued its downward trend — surprising because there’s not much AI you can do without data. We had several inbound predictions around DevOps but fewer than in past years, and digital transformation, once the buzzword of the day, has all but disappeared from the predictions narrative. Software as a service is still showing some life and, as with cybersecurity, the SaaS inbounds were sprinkled with AI throughout. And the “Other” category remained noticeable with topics around edge, public policy, jobs, social issues and the like. Most of the inbounds were more trends than predictions but there were a few that stood out. Just to give you a taste: The email subject line on predictions from Kevin Cochrane, the chief marketing officer of Vultr Inc., was Vendor Predictions that Don’t Suck. Cochrane predicts the following two items: We’ll see. The hyperscalers are likely to remain fairly walled with massive ecosystems that will allow them to claim openness through choice. And in our view they will get their piece of the sovereign AI pie. Another standout was from Zencoder Chief Executive Andrew Filev, who predicted massive coder productivity increases via agents culminating in the following prediction: And one more from Tarun Desikan of SonicWall Inc., who predicts: We hope this last prediction misses the mark! As a reminder, last week we hosted the “Data Gang” with a number of predictions around data platforms and related topics. OK, let’s move on to this year’s predictions from theCUBE Research and ETR. Above is a glance at all our predictions for this episode on one chart. They span macro tech spending, security, agentic AI, cloud computing, edge, intelligent automation, initial public offerings, data and jobs. We won’t spend too much time on this graphic, but it will give you a quick overview of this year’s menu. Each quarter ETR conducts its TSIS survey with Ns ranging from 1,500 to more than 1,800 on the above chart that measures expectations all the way back to the COVID era. As shown above, we came out of the isolation economy with very high expectations of 7.5% growth and that steadily decelerated as the war in Ukraine and the Fed tightening actions kicked in. We finished 2024 at just around 4%, which was a little lower than we predicted last year, and we enter 2025 with a 5.3% growth expectation from information technology decision makers. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Enterprise IT spending has shown signs of recovery following a period of uncertainty tied to macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. Though headlines warned of an impending recession, technical indicators never confirmed it, and new IT projects are now re-emerging. Our research indicates that overall budgets are on the rise, buoyed in part by a generally business-friendly environment and easing regulatory concerns, though a degree of unpredictability remains. In particular, small and medium-sized businesses are outpacing larger enterprises in spending, and optimism among C-suite executives is running higher than that of front-line practitioners. Bottom line: We believe the data points to a gradual but genuine revival of enterprise IT investment and an underlying tone of positivity given the new administration in the United States. Nonetheless, pockets of uncertainty remain — particularly around inflation, regulatory shifts and geopolitical dynamics. Over the coming quarters, we expect organizations will revise forecasts to reflect evolving market signals. The past three years have shown actuals coming in below expectations although the delta is compressing in what remains an unpredictable macro environment. Our second prediction goes right to the top topic of our inbounds, security. We’re predicting that despite the fact that organizations tell us they struggle to reduce the number of tools in their security stack, the idea of platformization will continue to gain traction in 2025 and become a more prominent theme amongst buyers. Above we show a graph that compares the spending profiles of dozens of security platforms. Net Score or spending momentum is shown on the vertical axis, with Overlap or presence in the data on the horizontal plane. The table inserted in the bottom right informs how the dots are plotted (Net Score by Ns in the survey for each vendor). Note that the graphic is both crowded and there’s lots of green, meaning spending on many vendors’ tool sets continues. Microsoft Corp. stands out in the upper right, and Wiz Inc. is well above the 40% line which we consider highly elevated. Zscaler Inc. and Snyk Ltd. are also above that line The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that by 2025, organizations will gravitate toward consolidated cybersecurity platforms, as intensifying threats and mounting complexity make best-of-breed approaches increasingly unsustainable. Nation-state actors now have access to compute at scale and AI capabilities, resulting in continuous, more sophisticated attacks that demand tighter integration and simplified management. Bottom line: We believe that by 2025, the intensity of cybersecurity threats will drive a widespread shift toward consolidated, platform-centric solutions. Although specialized tools will persist where differentiation is critical, the data suggests that simplicity, integration and ease of management will be the guiding principles for CISOs looking to reduce risk and maintain agile, secure environments. Our next prediction focuses on the buzzword of the day: agentic AI. We predict that there will be no “aha moment” foagentic AI in 2025 because security and data privacy concerns will be a headwind. Now, to be clear, we are excited about agentic. We just feel the hype is a bit ahead of reality. There are clear successes taking shape in companies such as Salesforce Inc., ServiceNow Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Workday Inc. Admittedly, there are mixed reviews around Microsoft copilots. Nonetheless, agents are being infused into all SaaS products. We look at agents as the next instantiation of large language models. Rather than prompts from just humans, agents will be pounding LLMs, enabling them to take action based on data context. This will increase the velocity of prompts by orders of magnitude and, as the AI stack evolves, multiple components of the AI stack will need to be secured and managed. Stitching these pieces of the stack together involves risks, creates seams and will be a blocker that needs to be addressed. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a growing yet cautious embrace of agentic AI across the enterprise. The positives in the data are that nearly half of surveyed organizations report some level of return on investment, and more than 86% plan to boost AI spending in the coming year. But notable hurdles exist. Specifically, organizations must address security, privacy and intellectual property concerns before AI-based agents achieve broader traction and deliver transformative impact. Bottom line: We believe that enterprise interest in agentic AI is genuine and growing, but organizations will not in 2025 experience a broad-based “aha moment” where these technologies become indispensable and trusted. Addressing security concerns, improving user training and refining real-world applications will be critical factors in driving AI from pockets of success to pervasive, transformative use. Our next prediction relates to the narrative around cloud repatriation. We think that the so-called cloud re-patriots are going to shift their marketing and focus instead on bringing AI to the data on-premises. The data we’re showing above underscores that cloud repatriation is really not a massive trend. Sure, 15% of the customers in this survey are repatriating some workloads, but it’s not an overwhelming revenue generator. A more viable approach in our view is a narrative around bringing AI to the data. And we think that will overtake the repatriation narrative. In a recent CUBE Research survey, we found that 58% of respondents plan to build their AI in their own private data centers. Customers tell us they love Amazon Web Services, they love Bedrock, they love Google LLC’s AI and they’re all Microsoft users. And when we ask why then are you building your own on-prem AI capabilities, they say: 1) That’s where much of our data lives; and 2) The cloud is expensive. And this all will lead to a discussion on edge which we’ll address in our next prediction. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our research indicates that the trend toward large-scale “cloud repatriation” remains more of a vendor marketing point than a significant market shift. While approximately 15% of organizations report moving some workloads back on-premises, the bulk of enterprise workloads that reside in the cloud will grow in the cloud. Bottom line: We believe that, while certain targeted workloads may move back on-prem for specific business or technical reasons, the cloud continues to dominate infrastructure strategies. The data suggests that repatriation is largely an edge case rather than a widespread reversal of the cloud adoption wave. Our next prediction is around the edge. We see AI inference at the edge showing measurable revenue progress in 2025. Edge computing will be a significant trend in 2025 that will shape and evolve the AI narrative. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We anticipate a surge in edge computing adoption by 2025, driven by the growing need to process data in real time, directly at the source. This trend underpins industries like robotics, manufacturing (Industry 4.0), full self-driving vehicles and retail, all of which demand low latency and rapid decision-making. Our research indicates that edge will not replace or detract from public clouds or on-premises environments. Instead, we expect edge to function as a complementary layer, feeding data to centralized locations for broader analytics and AI training. Bottom line: We believe edge computing will see strong momentum in 2025 as enterprises seek to speed up real-time insights while preserving the ability to leverage the cloud for large-scale analytics. The data suggests that this “cloud plus edge” model offers the best of both worlds: ultra-low latency for time-sensitive operations and centralized infrastructure for advanced AI workloads. Above we show ETR’s XY data format, Net Score by Overlap or penetration in the data set. Microsoft is in the upper right of this chart and will hit close to $200 billion in cloud revenue this year, all in. AWS will surpass $130 billion and Google will come in at about half of that. But as you see on this ETR chart, Salesforce will contribute $50 billion or so. It’s interesting to see CoreWeave Inc. on this. It’s a new name on the survey and it doesn’t appear to be setting the enterprise world on fire. Perhaps this is a case where model trainers rather than enterprises are using its stack at this point. The bar chart insert shows the all-in cloud revenue for infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and SaaS from theCUBE Research over time and is projected to surpass $1 trillion in 2025. The chart below provides additional survey detail and suggests that cloud spending is outpacing overall spending. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our customer survey research shows cloud spending (IaaS and Paas) growing at nearly double digits — around 9.5% — while SaaS, the second-highest category, lags behind at roughly 4.5%. Despite incremental price increases from cloud providers (averaging around 3%), the insatiable need for compute continues to push organizations to invest more heavily in cloud services. This trend underscores our view that large-scale repatriation remains a limited phenomenon. Bottom line: We believe the continued double-digit cloud growth and climbing levels of high-end spending confirm that organizations remain deeply committed to cloud infrastructure. Despite concerns about pricing or sporadic examples of repatriation, the data suggests that companies’ appetite for compute resources—in a large part fueled by AI—will keep the cloud market on a steady upward trajectory and all-in will surpass $1T in 2025. Next up is a prediction that is maybe a bit counterintuitive. Specifically, we think AI supercharges robotic process automation and is not a replacement. Early on, customers were thinking that gen AI in particular could do what RPA does but we don’t see it that way. In fact in many ways we look at RPA as very useful plumbing for enterprise AI and automation. Customer data suggests that they see AI as complementing RPA and capabilities such as process mining, process mapping, workflow optimization and the like will support agentic workflows. In the ETR XY chart above, you can see Microsoft Power Automate in the upper right and a number of other firms such as UiPath Inc., which is positioning for agentic with agent management frameworks and strong process knowledge. Others on this chart are positioning for agentic AI as well and we’re particularly excited about Celonis SE, which we’ve covered quite extensively on this program. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We see a resurgence in RPA spending and business process automation initiatives, despite initial concerns that AI would render traditional RPA obsolete. Rather than displacing RPA, emerging AI capabilities are proving complementary, giving rise to “intelligent automation” solutions that enhance the breadth and depth of what can be automated. Bottom line: We believe that RPA’s return to favor reflects its evolving role within a broader automation strategy. Rather than being displaced by AI, RPA is bolstered by these new capabilities, creating powerful, end-to-end automation solutions that promise enhanced efficiency and agility for organizations that embrace the synergy. Our next prediction is that IPOs will begin to come back in the first half, but really those companies that need the money will go out. We think others will wait to see the impact of the Trump administration, what happens with interest rates and the like. Above we’re showing a sit-down we had at our NYSE studio with Veeam Inc. CEO Anand Esweran. Veeam is owned by Insight Partners, which just did a private raise to prepare for what we believe will be an IPO later this year or more likely in 2026. Veeam doesn’t need the cash so it isn’t in a rush. Blue Yonder Group Inc., Snyk and the well-funded Databricks are other candidates. In addition, we’re watching firms such as Cohesity Inc., Cerberus Systems Inc., Klarna Bank AB, CoreWeave, Chime Financial Inc., Netskope Inc., Neo4j Inc., Stripe Inc. and Celonis. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We foresee a surge in IPO activity among technology firms that have been taken private in recent years or have remained in the private domain. Rising interest rates, lofty private valuations and the eventual need for liquidity events are converging to create a ripe environment for public offerings. Major private equity players such as Thoma Bravo and Vista, which acquired numerous software companies, are now incentivized to return these assets to public markets, much like the recent announcement involving SailPoint Technologies Inc. Bottom line: We believe that the combination of liquidity needs, rising interest rates, and sustained investor appetite for innovative tech solutions will drive an uptick in IPOs. Expect many of the names previously taken private or still in private hands to test the public markets as they seek funding for expansion, returns for backers, and the chance to better compete in an evolving landscape. We believe the point of control will clearly shift from the database up the stack towards governance catalogs that control open table formats. But the value will we think leapfrog that layer further up into the application stack, with agentic AI taking center stage, notwithstanding the security challenges we cited earlier. Above we show data from an August ETR. The gray bar is the one that is relevant where Iceberg, despite its newness, leads with 40% of customers at that time planning to use Iceberg. We think this trend will dramatically accelerate in 2025 with Delta and Iceberg merging via Databricks’ acquisition of Tabular. As the point of control shifts up the stack, the data platform players such as Snowflake Inc. and Databricks will increasingly run into the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow and other SaaS players that are taking greater control over the data that lives within their application stacks. These SaaS platforms not only have data but they have process knowledge, business logic and metadata, and are in a strong position to vie for control of the data. The following provides additional context for this prediction: We believe the next phase of data and AI evolution will move beyond separating compute from storage and cloud scalability. Increasingly, we believe the emphasis will be on how organizations refine, harmonize and govern data — rather than just where that data resides. In recent years, enterprises have focused heavily on laying foundational infrastructure for real-time analytics and AI. Now, our research suggests investment is shifting toward customer-facing applications and sophisticated data management layers, including semantic solutions that harmonize data, data catalogs and governance frameworks. Bottom line: We believe that as enterprise data ecosystems become more fluid — where any compute engine can tap into any data source — governance, discoverability and semantic consistency will define market winners. Though Databricks and Snowflake appear to be leading the charge, hyperscalers remain well-positioned thanks to their scale and go-to-market muscle. Ultimately, organizations seeking to stay competitive must invest in advanced data management and semantic tooling that aligns real-time processing with broader AI objectives. Our last prediction is one that addresses some of the media hype around jobs. We don’t believe AI will dramatically kill jobs in 2025 and spike unemployment. And we think that longer-term, AI will create more jobs that require different skill sets. This data we’re showing above is from an ETR survey and a new feature they’ve announced. We’ve highlighted in red the salient responses where 600 customers say they’re not slowing hiring because of AI and they’re not reducing headcount. The following provides additional context for this prediction: Our most recent AI product survey data suggests that, contrary to popular headlines, AI initiatives are not yet displacing jobs at large scale. Though a handful of organizations have blamed layoffs on new AI-driven productivity gains, the overwhelming majority of survey respondents do not anticipate reducing headcount or slowing hiring because of AI this year. Notably, many organizations are not yet measuring AI’s return on investment in strictly financial terms; instead, they perceive its value in less quantifiable ways — such as improved quality, speed and productivity. Bottom line: We believe that, at least in the near term, AI will not significantly reduce enterprise headcount. Instead, organizations are investing in people who can design, deploy and manage AI systems. Over the longer run, better measurement of ROI and further technological maturity may change the equation, but for 2025, AI appears more poised to create new opportunities than to eliminate jobs. One last added prediction. We’ve been outspoken about Intel and predict it will have no choice but to spin out its foundry business in 2025. Our concern is that Intel’s design business will be acquired in this process, but we most certainly hope not. We believe it’s in the industry’s and country’s best interests for Intel to remain independent. The contributions Intel has made to the technology industry are enormous. Intel was the IBM of its day, an iconic innovator that supported two decades of innovation, the mainspring of which was microprocessor-based computing. For Intel to be subsumed by a firm with a higher market cap or inflated valuations from AI expectations would be a shame. Read our plan to save Intel and maintain its independence, while securing the long-term interests of the United States. We call on the current administration and the spate of tech CEOs who have come out of the woodwork to support President Trump to deeply consider how Intel enabled today’s tech companies to thrive and do your part to help Intel make an Apple-like comeback. What do you think? How do you see 2025 shaping up? What are your predictions for the year? Please let us know.

Amazon’s decision to shut down seven distribution centres in Quebec, affecting over 1,900 jobs, has sparked sharp criticism from Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne. In a strongly worded letter addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Champagne expressed disappointment over the closures and urged the company to reconsider, shared the minister on Thursday evening on X. “When Amazon entered the Canadian market, it did so recognizing the value of Canada’s exceptional workers,” Champagne wrote. He pointed out the closures undermine Amazon’s commitment to being “Earth’s best employer” and called the decision inconsistent with the company’s values. The closures come after Amazon’s Laval distribution centre became the first in North America to unionize, raising speculation that decision could be linked to its resistance to unionized labour. Champagne argued that Amazon’s Quebec facilities play a vital role in the company’s supply chain, ensuring quick delivery across the province and contributing significantly to the local economy. He added that the layoffs would have ripple effects on communities, highlighting the importance of Amazon’s business partnership with Canada. “It is not too late to reconsider your decision,” Champagne urged, adding that such layoffs raise concerns about Amazon’s long-term commitment to the Canadian market. The letter called for a review of Amazon’s relationship with the Canadian government and extended an invitation to discuss the matter further. With Parliament currently prorogued by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and a spring federal election looming, Champagne’s words don’t mean much. But at least it makes his constituents feel better. In an emailed statement to iPhone in Canada on Wednesday, Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said, “Following a recent review of our Quebec operations, we’ve seen that returning to a third-party delivery model supported by local small businesses, similar to what we had until 2020, will allow us to provide the same great service and even more savings to our customers over the long run.” She added, “This decision wasn’t made lightly, and we’re offering impacted employees a package that includes up to 14 weeks’ pay after facilities close and transitional benefits, like job placement resources.” In a nutshell, Laval workers unionized and Amazon appealed to the labour board, citing the vote didn’t recognize worker rights, since the vote was not by secret ballot, but rather by signing cards. Amazon lost the appeal–and now they have pulled out of Quebec.

Title: Washington Post editor says newspaper ‘utterly lost its soul’ after ‘equating’ Biden, Trump pardons

A longtime associate editor at the Washington Post criticized his own newspaper for an editorial that blasted both President Trump and his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for having “both abused their pardon powers” and “setting dangerous precedents.” David Maraniss, who has spent nearly five decades at the Washington Post, took to social media on Wednesday and bemoaned the fact that his employer “has utterly lost its soul.” “The Washington Post editorial this morning essentially equating Biden’s questionable pardons with Trump’s outrageous Jan. 6 pardons was unconscionable,” Maraniss wrote on the Bluesky microblogging platform on Wednesday. “The newspaper I’ve been part of for 48 years has utterly lost its soul.” Maraniss, who has written biographies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, referred to an editorial titled: “Pardons from Biden and Trump flout the rule of law.” “President Joe Biden started the trouble by issuing preemptive pardons for five family members as well as former members of his administration,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote. “His rash action opens the door for future presidents to likewise immunize their families and staffs from merely theoretical prosecution by their successors — as though future presidents should be considered enemies whose actions must be defended against.” In the next paragraph, the editorial calls out Trump for pardoning those convicted for their roles in the rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “His reckless handout risks emboldening militias and others to commit future acts of barbarity in support of political aims. When such violence is tolerated, it happens more often,” the editorial read. The New York Post has sought comment from the Washington Post. Maraniss on Thursday told Status newsletter that it “disheartens” him “to see what is happening in this era of leadership” — a reference to owner Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the Amazon founder, has so far ignored a request from more than 400 of the newspaper’s staffers to visit the newsroom in the wake of an exodus of talent sparked by the decision to spike an endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris. A large chunk of the newspaper’s left-leaning readership was so outraged by the move that a reported 250,000 subscribers canceled their memberships. “People are in utter despair,” a Washington Post staffer told Status. The newsletter said Washington Post employees found it “confounding … as to why Bezos insists on maintaining ownership of the newspaper.” “While he once seemed to take pride in owning it, and perhaps even enjoyed that the outlet served as a bulwark against Trump in his first term, that no longer seems to be the case,” Oliver Darcy wrote in Status. The Post has sought comment from Bezos. In recent weeks, the Washington Post has parted ways with several high-profile reporters and editors who have decamped for other media outlets. Philip Rucker, the highly regarded national editor, left for CNN, while longtime opinion columnist and Trump-basher Jennifer Rubin resigned to join Substack. Ann Telnaes, the newspaper’s cartoonist, resigned after the publication refused to print her cartoon mocking Bezos and other tech moguls as being too subservient to Trump. Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, two national political reporters, left for The Atlantic while investigative political reporter Josh Dawsey quit to join the Wall Street Journal. Morale at the Washington Post has been further damaged by recent layoffs of staffers on the business side. Management at the newspaper has also laid down the law and told staffers that they are welcome to submit their resignation if they refuse to return to the office five days per week. Advertisement

Saturday, 25 Jan 2025 OTTAWA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is threatening to review its commercial relationship with Amazon after the online retail giant decided to close all its distribution centers in Quebec, local media reported Friday. Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne, expressing his strong disappointment, demanded that Amazon "immediately" reconsider the decision, according to the report. Amazon said that it would cease operations in the French-speaking province over the next two months, turning back to the third-party model it had until 2020 for package deliveries. As such, at least 1,700 regular employees in Quebec and 250 temporary-seasonal workers would lose their jobs, said the report. "This is not the way business is done in Canada," said Champagne on his social media account, stating that the "large and sudden layoffs are cause for concern." Amazon denied that the decision was made following the unionization of 200 employees last spring at one of the warehouses, according to the report. Thank you for your report!

Title: Stripe ruffles feathers as accidental ‘cartoon duck’ sent to laid-off staffers

An image accidentally sent to laid-off Stripe staffers shows their communications team might have just been winging it. The payment processing platform accidentally sent an image of a cartoon duck in emails to employees notifying them of their termination, The Post has learned. On Monday, Stripe – whose customers include Amazon, Alaska Airlines, Blockchain.com and Slack – announced it was laying off 300 employees, or approximately 3.5% of its workforce. The impacted staffers are mostly in product, engineering and operations roles, according to a leaked memo. These workers received emails with an attached image labeled “US-Non-California Duck” showing a fluffy yellow cartoon bird. Employees took to Blind, an anonymous site where corporate employees can share grievances, to make light of the duck-up. “Never liked it when someone put a duck on my Jeep…this would have sent me over the edge,” one Blind user registered as a Stripe employee wrote. A Stripe spokesperson confirmed that the duck images were accidentally sent to laid-off staffers, and that impacted employees received notices with the incorrect termination dates, as well. Business Insider earlier reported news of the leaked emails. “I apologize for the error and any confusion it caused,” Rob McIntosh, Stripe’s chief people officer, said in an email to employees. “Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes.” In a separate email, McIntosh told Stripe staffers that the company is still hoping to grow its workforce by 17% to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year. The tech startup, which launched in 2011, has suffered layoffs in the past. Stripe is a privately-held company, so most of its financials are not disclosed, but it was likely hit hard in 2022, when it laid off more than 1,000 staffers. At the time, CEO Patrick Collison blamed the economy and fears of a recession in a public letter – an explanation that won praise for its frankness. Stripe also cut its valuation multiple times over the years, though it recently jumped back up to around $70 billion in November, according to Bloomberg. The valuation puts Stripe in the same ranks as wealthy startups like SpaceX and OpenAI, though it’s still below its 2021 peak of $95 billion. Stripe is the second-largest startup in the Bay Area, behind only OpenAI, according to SFGate. Advertisement

Title: Trump has a message to CEOs: Build in America or pay up

President Donald Trump is making sure the whole world knows it: "America is back and open for business." Trump appeared via videolink to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he addressed some of the world's most powerful leaders. BI's Spriha Srivastava was in the room to witness the audience go from laughter to silence in seconds. "My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America," Trump said. "If you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff," he added. Trump has previously threatened to impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, which he said could begin as early as February 1. He also proposed a 60% tariff on China during his presidential campaign, but he said earlier this week he was considering a 10% tariff on goods from the country next month. When Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman asked about Europe, Trump didn't hold back, voicing his frustration with European regulatory enforcement actions against tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta (who were major donors to his inauguration and whose CEOs were prominent guests). "Whether you like them or not, they're American companies, and they shouldn't be doing that," Trump said. Trump has plans for the corporate tax rate. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders. Trump said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US. The president also called out big banks, accusing them of discriminating against conservatives. "Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America," he said. Bank of America responded publicly, saying it welcomes conservatives among its 70 million clients. The president also thanked Saudi Arabia after it announced it would invest $600 billion in the US, but Trump added that he would be asking the crown prince "who's a fantastic guy, to round it out to around $1 trillion." When Trump finished, Schwarzman remarked: "I'm sure the crown prince of Saudi Arabia will be really glad you gave this speech today." Trump's speech reminded Spriha of how different his style is from the measured, diplomatic tone that usually defines Davos. Whether his message landed the way he intended, however, is another question. BI's Katie Balevic, Dominick Reuter, Noah Sheidlower, and Allie Kelly have the full rundown of Trump's address.

Title: Want a Job In AI & Healthcare Tech? Here Are 5 Growth Areas Actively Hiring Right Now

There is significant demand for individuals interested in artificial intelligence and digital ... [+] transformation. There are widely mixed opinions on the state of the current job market. Most industry leaders signal that economic conditions seem to be healthy and the state of the market is incredibly robust. In fact, the latest report indicates that the U.S. economy added nearly 256,000 positions in December. However, many individuals are equally frustrated with the lack of opportunities and are experiencing a relatively stagnant labor market, especially with the numerous layoffs that have occurred in the last year. Some sectors have been more proactive than others, especially with regards to investing heavily in the new wave of AI innovation and digital transformation, which has resulted in increased demand for talent and skilled workers. Healthcare is one such field and has especially embraced AI as a means to reduce administrative burdens and improve workflows in the field. Indeed, 2025 will be a monumental year for this work. Individuals that are interested in healthcare technology and AI may have opportunities in the following 5 growth areas that are actively ramping up spending and hiring: 1. Work surrounding AI agents: 2025 is purported to be the year of AI agents in healthcare, which may be used for a variety of roles including responding to customer service inquiries, assisting with routine paperwork or even streamlining common and protocolized tasks. In fact, founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang mentioned at the CES conference earlier this month that IT departments will soon “become the HR of AI agents,” given how widespread and prevalent they will become. 2. Cloud engineering and architecture: many of the largest AI platforms including those by Google, Amazon and Microsoft are hosted and provided through their respective cloud services. For example, Google’s Vertex AI Search is a widely successful product which streamlines search within healthcare organizations and enables rapid insight generation for providers. Healthcare organizations can access this platform through Google Cloud. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer similar services. Thus, cloud applications have become incredibly critical in the AI arena and will undoubtedly require a lot of talent. 3. Digital twins technology: this is another growing area which enables organizations to create virtual models to run simulations and alter paradigms to better inform decision-making. Digital twin platforms can entail technical models such as a human heart model or a protein molecule to aid in drug development, or larger datasets across an entire population or community to inform macroscopic decisions. Digital twins have immense potential in healthcare as the technology can be used to resolve critical situations with high fidelity representations. Dr. Natalia Trayanova leads some of this work at Johns Hopkins University and uses the technology to support personalized healthcare in the field of cardiology: “digital twinning technology promises to deliver a digital representation of organs or even patients by using tools capable of simulating personal health conditions and predicting patient or disease trajectories on the basis of relationships learned both from data and from biophysics knowledge. Such virtual replicas would update themselves with data from monitoring devices and medical tests and assessments, reflecting dynamically the changes in our health conditions and the responses to treatment.” 4. Health devices: this area is projected to have a blockbuster decade as there has been an increased focus by the general population on collecting more health metrics and insights. For example, Google’s FitBit is one of the most popular devices in the world of personalized hardware and provides users with information on their daily energy expenditure and fitness goals. Another great example is the Oura ring, which has been incredibly popular in the last few years as a sleep tracking device; the company just recently hit $5 billion in valuation. There is a huge demand for both software experts and hardware engineers in this line of work. 5. Technology strategy: these roles will be a key aspect of healthcare organization portfolios in the coming years. Despite all the technical work, organizations must ultimately devise a strategy and justify their investments in artificial intelligence and digital health. This is where senior strategists and those familiar with enterprise optimization can come in handy, especially as many organizations are struggling to still define and realize the true ROI for healthcare AI applications. These leaders will be paramount to understand the technology landscape, develop accurate forecasts and determine the future course for organizations. Undoubtedly, those interested in technology will have to remain nimble and willing to up-skill themselves accordingly. Despite a rapidly changing job landscape, the swift growth of technology and AI, especially as they pertain to healthcare, offer numerous potential opportunities for determined job seekers to take advantage of.

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s Africa content team has reshuffled with ex-Amazon exec Kaye-Ann Williams brought in to oversee TV and movies as Tendeka Matatu exits. Williams takes on the newly-created Director of Scripted Content role and will focus on local productions, overseeing a team that develops and creates African original films and series. She joins after a short stint as content boss at The Traitors South Africa producer Primedia Studios and is a former Head of Scripted Series and Movies at Prime Video/Amazon Studios, where she focused on South Africa. Commencing her role next month, Williams will report to Ben Amadasun, Netflix’s Vice President of Middle East & Africa Content.

No word on Matatu’s next move but we are told he is pursuing other opportunities. His credits included Heart of the Hunter and Kandasamys: The Baby. Amadasun credited Williams with helping creative talent “create some of the most ambitious projects on African television.” “I’m delighted to welcome Kaye-Ann to the team as we strengthen our long-term commitment to African storytelling,” he added. “I look forward to working alongside her to further build on the wonderful work the team has done so far to deliver compelling stories from Africa and to nurture our many local creative partnerships.” Amazon cut funding in Africa and made layoffs last year and sources from the local sector had recently questioned whether Netflix was heading in the same direction, with rumors of shows being pulled. Netflix pushed back, noting that it is “strengthening its investment in African storytelling” and pointing to Williams’ stellar credentials. Since kickstarting local African commissioning with 2020’s Queen Sono, Netflix cited significant deals struck with the likes of Silverton Siege’s Mandla Dube and Jayan Moodley, creator of the Kandasamys franchise. At the recent MIP Africa in Cape Town, Amadasun unveiled a trio of new movies along with a Blood Legacy series from Blood & Water producer Gambit Films and reality show Love Never Lies: South Africa. The news comes off the back of a strong week for Netflix. The streaming powerhouse smashed estimates by adding nearly 19 million subscribers in Q4 – the final quarter for which it will report these numbers.

Title: ‘We are treated like ‘boat people:’ Indian techies alarmed by Trump’s bros

Time Published: 2025-01-24T09:05:09Z

On a pleasant January morning in Bengaluru, known globally as the Silicon Valley of India, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti opened a new consulate, the fifth in the South Asian nation. In three days, the Joe Biden appointee would step down, paving the way for the Trump 2.0 administration to choose his replacement. Speaking at the event, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called it a “new milestone” in bilateral relations, particularly in sectors like technology, space, defense, and education. “As we enter an era of AI, EVs, drones, biotechnology, and advanced space exploration, our partnership will increasingly be defined by innovation. Bengaluru, as India’s tech capital, and [the state of] Karnataka, as a hub of innovation, will play crucial roles in this journey,” Jaishankar said. Three days later, on January 20, he would be attending the swearing-in ceremony of US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. Later, he would engage the newly appointed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the issue of “irregular immigration” and visa policy regarding the millions of Indian professionals in the US. On that January day, around 8,000 miles away, in a Boston suburb, N. Ranganathan, a 36-year-old software techie working as a software analyst, was visibly upset with a leading aircraft manufacturer. He, his wife and their three-year-old son were in for a hard realization about the US being “a land of dreams.” “I have been in this country for the last seven years and with my son having been born here, I was hoping that my son gets naturalized citizenship. With the latest ruling by the president, I am not sure whether I and my family want to be [here], as we feel disrespected about the fact that despite paying taxes as well as contributing to the US economy, we are treated like ‘boat people’ (refugees).” Like Ranganathan, millions of Indians face the dilemma of whether to continue working in the US or seek alternative options. US President Donald Trump began his term in office with sweeping executive orders, including one ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are neither American citizens nor permanent residents. This could affect over a million Indians waiting for green cards – with some of them locked in a bureaucratic backlog for a decade. However, broader concern over Trump’s visa policies during his second term is something that is being discussed both among the diaspora in the US and back in Bengaluru and other Indian tech hubs. India’s $250 billion IT outsourcing industry is at a critical juncture – and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not the biggest challenge. In December, social media was boiling after billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy defended the tech industry’s need to bring in foreign workers. Their statements sparked an online spat between anti-immigration Trump loyalists and the tech-oriented conservative faction. The US tech industry, which is facing layoffs, relies on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of IT professionals – mainly from India (over 72%), as well as China and other nations. Supporters claim that H-1B workers address essential skill shortages and foster innovation, while opponents argue that the program keeps wages low and displaces US employees. Musk, who himself is a South African immigrant who once held an H-1B visa, said he was in favor of bringing “the top ~0.1% of engineering talent” via a legal route as it is “essential for America to keep winning.” He also told critics to “go f*** yourself in the face,” referring to them as “subtards.” Musk has long argued for increased immigration and greater opportunities for skilled workers to live and work in the US, often pointing out that the country’s long-term success depends on attracting the best and brightest talent globally. The online standoff came days after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rule aimed at ‘reforming’ the H-1B program to help American companies address critical workforce shortages. The new rule looks to simplify the approval process, enhancing flexibility for employers to retain skilled workers, and strengthen the program’s oversight and integrity. Additionally, on December 27th, the US Department of State announced the completion of a successful pilot program to let people renew H-1B visas without having to leave the country. This pilot program streamlined the renewal process for thousands of applicants, the Department of State said, promising to establish a US-based renewal program in 2025. At around the same time, President Trump announced the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born venture capitalist, to lead artificial intelligence policy. In the past, Krishnan had supported the removal of country caps on green cards for skilled immigrants in the US. This was too much for some MAGA supporters, who feel that this visa system needs to be scrapped as it doesn’t add any value to the US economy and instead takes away the jobs of people who have similar qualifications. In some cases, American workers who were laid off were forced to train their H-1B counterparts. If they failed to do so, they risked losing their severance pay. Federal lawsuits were filed by two of the tech workers laid off from the Walt Disney Co. One of them even testified before a Senate Committee. The war of words on H-1B was not limited to social media. There have been racist attacks against Indians on the TV and in real life. Fox News carried an interview with a commentator who openly referred to Indians as “third world parasites.” Immediately after the online fracas between Musk and other MAGA supporters, Trump came to Elon’s defense. In an interview with the New York Post, he praised the use of visas to bring skilled foreign workers to the US. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said. Speaking at a press conference at the White House after taking office, Trump said “I like both sides of the argument, but I also like very competent people coming into our country, even if that involves them training and helping other people that may not have the qualifications they do,” he said while addressing a joint press conference at the White House with Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Open AI CEO Sam Altman. “We have to have quality people coming in. Now by doing that, we’re expanding businesses and that takes care of everybody. So I’m sort of on both sides of the argument, but what I really do feel is that we have to let really competent people, great people, come into our country. And we do that through the H-1B program,” he added. This marked a U-turn on H-1B visas for Trump; in 2016 he called them "very, very bad” for American workers. Months before the end of his first term as president in 2020, he imposed a temporary ban on the visas, which was later struck down by a federal court. The question for those whose lives and profits revolve around H-1B visas remains open – how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech? The H-1B visa program, which started in 1990, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that typically require a high level of technical expertise (fields such as IT, engineering, and healthcare). The visa is initially granted for three years, and can be extended by another three years. Every year, 85,000 such visas are up for grabs, through a lottery system. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Qualcomm Technologies, Ernst and Young, as well as outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Consulting, HCL America and others heavily rely on H-1B visas. Indian companies, who swarmed the US in large numbers at the height of the dotcom boom-in the 1990s are the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas.In May 2024, according to US State Department data from 2022, as much as 77% of 320,000 H-1B visa applications went to Indians. Indian companies are taking measures to counter any negative pushback with regard to H-1B visas, by hiring locals. For India’s second-largest information technology company Infosys, over 60% of the workforce in the US now comprises locals, Infosys’ Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka told media recently. TCS CEO Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that a decrease in H-1B visas can be offset by other strategies, such as relocating work to India, reducing the overall reliance on H-1B. From the first time Trump took charge in 2016, the US authorities have clamped down on frauds related to applications from H-1B, increased the cost of filings [upwards of $8,000] and even limited repeated filings, in an effort to make the system fair. As a result, people can no longer submit multiple applications to increase their chances of winning the lottery, as this creates an unfair advantage. The crackdown on frauds seemed to have worked to some extent. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS] revealed that the number of entries for the year’s lottery stood at 470,342, marking a substantial 38% decline from the 758,994 entries received in 2023, according to a report by the Associated Press. Since December, both Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, seem to have offered their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the program needs a fix. “Easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,” Musk said days after telling critics to “go f*** yourself.” Immigrant attorneys believe that unlike the past, this time things may actually change. “The system is broken and it needs to be fixed, especially around the area of what is considered to be a job/service that cannot be done by a local and requires a special visa,” an attorney from a Washington-based law firm told RT. Meanwhile, India has used diplomatic language to advocate for favorable visa policies while emphasizing mutual benefits and India’s indispensable role in the partnership. “India-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in early January, breaking his silence on the H-1B debate. Industry watchers believe that H-1B visas can still address the basic issues which led to its creation in the first place, i.e. supplying engineers to met tech’s gargantuan demands. “The H-1B program, which is based on numerical limits set over 30 years ago, still remains terribly short of meeting the needs of the US economy in the global competition for talent, particularly in STEM fields,” believes Ashank Desai, Principal Founder and former Chairman of Mastek as well as founding member of Indian software lobby firm NASSCOM. Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman and Founder of 5F World, and formerly CEO of Zensar, a Pune-based outsourcing firm, told RT the H-1B mindset needs to change “from wage arbitrage to quality of talent. In many ways, it needs to evolve.” Ultimately, the next move of the Trump administration will significantly impact India’s exports. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India’s total exports reached $776.68 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Software exports alone account for about 4% of the country’s GDP and generate approximately 5.4 million direct jobs and nearly 20 million indirect jobs. Therefore, any changes to visa policies are likely to affect India’s export landscape.
