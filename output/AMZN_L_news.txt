Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said.

"The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said.

(photo credit: Chanat Katanyu) Pun Paniangvait, general manager of Thai President Foods Plc, the manufacturer of Mama instant noodles, said the company expects to expand its workforce in line with the growth of its manufacturing operations. The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Title: On the anniversary of the dot-com bubble bursting, is history repeating itself?

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is signaling he’s ready to take bold steps to revitalize the US chipmaker’s business and reclaim its competitive edge. “In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog,” he wrote in a letter to employees that was made public. The letter offers a glimpse of how Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, will lead Intel when it faces intense competition from Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, which use Taiwan’s TSMC to build cutting-edge chips. In naming Tan CEO, Intel’s board cited "his proven track record of creating shareholder value"—which can be a worrying sign for PC builders and technologists more concerned about the company’s chip prowess than its financials. But in his letter to employees, Tan said, "Under my leadership, Intel will be an engineering-focused company." "We will push ourselves to develop the best products, listen intently to our customers, and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we make so that we build trust,” he added. In terms of strategy, Tan says he’ll push Intel to “double down” on areas where the company already excels. In areas where it's behind, Tan will try to boldly leapfrog. "And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace." One of Tan's chief goals is to "establish ourselves as a world-class foundry," which indicates that he plans to keep Intel’s chip foundry business rather than spin it off. In 2021, the company made another bold bet by expanding into the foundry business under previous CEO Pat Gelsinger, who sought to compete directly with TSMC in contract semiconductor manufacturing. However, the endeavor is costing Intel tens of billions of dollars. An Ohio factory has also been delayed to the early 2030s. Meanwhile, TSMC is preparing to spend $165 billion to build six new fabs in Arizona. For now, Intel appears to be bullish on its upcoming 18A manufacturing process, which will start producing cutting-edge PC chips in the second half of this year. Both Intel and clients—including Microsoft, Amazon, and Arm—have signed up to use the 18A process. Although Tan’s letter is meant to rally the troops, industry watchers also expect layoffs. Before becoming CEO, Tan was an Intel board member for two years. But in August, he abruptly resigned over disagreements with Gelsinger. This included Tan demanding deeper cuts to Intel’s “bloated workforce” and bureaucracy, according to Reuters. Gelsinger initiated layoffs, but only to 15% of the company’s employee base.

Title: Can the Free Press Be Saved?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to protect independent media. When Disney announced yet another round of layoffs at ABC News last week, it came on the heels of a year in which almost 15,000 media jobs were lost—and capped off a quarter-century in which we’ve seen thousands of independent publications shut down or merged with larger conglomerates. The upshot is that Americans now find ourselves trapped in an information environment more tightly controlled than ever by a handful of oligarchs. The media has trended in this direction for decades, but the story lost all subtlety when Jeff Bezos issued the X post heard round the world. He declared that The Washington Post will focus its opinion section on “personal liberties and free markets.” That surely means more editorial attention on stifling monopolies like Amazon, right? Jeet Heer Books & the Arts / David Klion Feature / Eamon Whalen Joan Walsh Mainstream media outlets have long faced dwindling audiences and, as a result, relied more and more on corporate benefactors. Now that those benefactors are competing to prove loyalty to their own benefactor in the White House, these essential institutions are stuck carrying water for the billionaire class, or else disappearing altogether. The task of rebuilding truly independent news outlets, then, falls to journalists, readers, and any concerned citizens who recognize how imperiled our free press has become—if there is to be any hope of the fourth estate holding the line against the second Trump regime. Editorial encroachment by corporate interests dates back to the inception of the media age, when the competing newspaper empires of the ultra-wealthy William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer engaged in a sensationalist race to the bottom, publishing incendiary headlines, exaggerations, gossip, and rumors that (among other ramifications) helped provoke the Spanish-American war. Yellow journalism, as it was called, abated thanks to the regulatory efforts of independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which established the fairness doctrine requiring equal coverage of conflicting viewpoints on consequential issues (like Trump’s ongoing attempt to take over the FCC). But Ronald Reagan, in his laissez-faire frenzy, repealed that rule. Not to be outdone, Bill Clinton signed the deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996, which critics have deemed “essentially bought and paid for by corporate media lobbies.” That same year, The Nation published a special issue on what we called the National Entertainment State. It detailed the growing media-industrial complex, where the corporations programming our news were increasingly programming public opinion. We represented this syndicate via a glossy centerfold diagram of an octopus with four tentacles, one for each of America’s dominant media conglomerates: Disney, General Electric, Time Warner, and Westinghouse (now CBS). Today, six tentacles control over 90 perent of our information. Things are different now, and not for the better. While the news has represented a small cog in larger corporate structures long before this second Trump administration, we are now witnessing mass public capitulation from corporate owners in a way that feels unprecedented. Whether today’s billionaire media owners are angling for large federal contracts or anticipatorily bending the knee so their companies are not seen as “the enemy,” the chilling effect is the same: Major media publications are even more incentivized now to treat the rich and powerful with kid gloves, if not outright sycophancy. The few that refuse to do this will have to face the wrath of our notoriously censorious, litigious head of state. The most powerful man in the world is currently suing Iowa pollster Ann Selzer for merely predicting that Kamala Harris would win the state last November; what he calls “election fraud” most people call “polling.” With that context, is there any reason to expect that prominent players like Paramount and Skydance would do anything but hold the line if it means getting FCC approval for their merger? The natural counterbalance to for-profit media would seem to be nonprofit newsrooms. They need not go cross-eyed from trying to keep in view both the public’s interest and that of their owner. In the US alone, there are at least 475 independent outlets, from the Marshall Project to the Center for Public Integrity, which has won several Pulitzer prizes for its investigative reporting. And independent journalism is currently enjoying a renaissance on self-publishing platforms like Substack and the newly launched Noosphere. These sites offer refuge for writers that have renounced (or been renounced by) corporate news, including Mehdi Hasan and Matt Taibbi. The journalistic equivalent of farm-to-table, it cuts out any meddlesome middle-moguls between the writer and the reader. (The Nation has been independent since 1865.) Yet neither of these alternatives offer a true one-to-one replacement for mainstream outlets. For all their latent bias, our media behemoths are uniquely positioned to furnish the resources to fund years-long investigations that often incur legal backlash, such as the Pentagon Papers—which might not have resonated as deeply with the Mailchimp logo at the bottom. Not so long ago, Jeff Bezos was proud to bear this torch. At the inception of his ownership, he claimed Katharine Graham’s pugnacious leadership as his model, and seemingly sincerely so, even if the Post did go soft on its coverage of Amazon of its own volition. I experienced Bezos’s benign neglect firsthand. From 2011 to 2022, I penned over 500 columns for the paper, most of them during Bezos’s tenure—including columns directly criticizing Amazon’s labor practices and even the corporate bias of the Post itself. I never received any note remotely resembling the kind of editorial restrictions that he is imposing today—the likes of which just led the columnist and associate editor Ruth Marcus to resign after four decades at the paper. Nevertheless, for a time, at least in this case, corporate ownership didn’t have to be mutually exclusive with editorial independence. But until that détente between owner and editorial is reestablished, audiences and reporters will continue to flee compromised publications. In his e-mail to The Washington Post’s team, Bezos argued that this newspaper of record could dodge offering a variety of perspectives because “the internet does that job.” It will take a new movement of responsible readers and benefactors to ensure that this is true. Donald Trump’s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started. In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches. Only robust independent journalism can cut through the noise and offer clear-eyed reporting and analysis based on principle and conscience. That’s what The Nation has done for 160 years and that’s what we’re doing now. Our independent journalism doesn’t allow injustice to go unnoticed or unchallenged—nor will we abandon hope for a better world.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs are here and disrupting the markets, with new duties on aluminum and steel and threats against European spirits. He’s created a trade war with Canada, which just got a new prime minister, and slammed stocks. Despite that, Trump officials — and the president himself — have said tariffs are key to the U.S.’ economic strategy, and more duties are waiting in the wings. That could cause issues for companies like Boeing, which has warned of potential supply issues if Trump’s tariffs stick around for a while. Tesla is taking hits tied to CEO Elon Musk’s role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which has helped federal agencies enact mass layoffs and other cost-cutting measures (and given Mark Cuban an idea). Amazon is also appealing to Trump, as founder Jeff Bezos courts the president. Catch up on all that and more — including three senators’ demands for Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — in this week’s politics roundup. 2 / 12 President Donald Trump’s latest bid to tackle the European Union’s “hostile and abusive” trading practices is to tack new duties on alcohol imports.

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The watch and accessories company is the latest to shore up its wholesale channel and pull back on direct-to-consumer sales. Fossil is the latest brand to pull back on DTC in a quest for profitability. Last year the company closed a net 54 stores globally, ending 2024 with 248, including 114 in the Americas. Remaining locations will get upgrades, emphasize traditional watches and highlight personalization, CEO Franco Fogliato, who arrived in September, told analysts Wednesday. “Looking at our direct-to-consumer business, we believe there is a significant opportunity to strengthen our model, becoming smaller but much more profitable,” he said. “We are deploying a two-pronged approach which includes prioritizing the wholesale channel and transforming our direct-to-consumer business model.” To shore up its wholesale channel and “bolster our relationships with our wholesale partners around the globe,” the company is working “to become increasingly less promotional in our DTC channels,” and helped drive gross margin expansion in Q4, he also said. Greben has “a strong track record of business transformations – ranging from deep turnarounds to high-growth strategies for a number of leading consumer brands,” the company said in a Wednesday press release. At Casper, he led the 2023 sale of the Canadian business and cut costs. He has also served as chief financial officer at various other companies, including Blue Apron, Ann Inc. and Quidsi, the Marc Lore-founded enterprise acquired and later shuttered by Amazon. In addition to its own branded merchandise, including Fossil, Michele, Relic, Skagen and Zodiac, Fossil has licensing agreements with Armani Exchange, Diesel, Emporio Armani, Kate Spade New York, Michael Kors, Skechers and Tory Burch. Fogliato said the company is making “progress toward achieving minimum royalty reduction with some of our long-time licensed brand partners who we continue to prioritize.” The company in February extended its agreement with Michael Kors, a partnership of some 20 years.

Title: FAIR: ‘These Strikes Are a Good Example of Why We Shouldn’t Just Succumb to Despair’CounterSpin interview with Eric Blanc on worker-to-worker organizing

FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING Challenging media bias since 1986. FAIR FAIR is the national progressive media watchdog group, challenging corporate media bias, spin and misinformation. Janine Jackson interviewed Rutgers University’s Eric Blanc about worker-to-worker organizing as a key force of resistance for the March 7, 2025, episode of CounterSpin. This is a lightly edited transcript. The New Republic (2/13/25) Janine Jackson: The difficult and disturbing political moment is throwing some underlying fissures in US society into relief. Along with which side some folks turn out to be on, we’re learning what levers of power regular people actually have and how we can use them. And we’re reminded that the antidote to fear and confusion is one another, is community, including the particularly powerful form of community that is a labor union. Indeed, workers can wield power even shy of a union, though that’s not a story you will often read about in major media. Eric Blanc is a longtime labor activist and organizer as well as assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. He’s author of Red State Revolt: The Teacher Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics from Verso and, out this year, We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing Is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big from UC Press. He also writes the newsletter laborpolitics.com. He joins us now by phone from here in town. Welcome to CounterSpin, Eric Blanc. Eric Blanc: Thanks for having me on. JJ: Well, let me ask you to start with federal workers, who are, as we see, a primary target of Trump and Musk, but you remind us federal workers are also a key force of resistance here. Tell us about that. EB: It’s hard to exaggerate the stakes of the fight right now around federal workers. There’s a reason that Musk and Trump have started by trying to decimate federal services and decimate federal unions, and that’s because they understand that these are blockages on their attempt to have sort of full authoritarian control over the government and to be able to just impose their reactionary agenda irrespective of the law. And they know that they need to not just fire the heads of these agencies, but they need to be able to have a workforce that is so terrified of the administration that they’ll comply even when the law is being broken. And so they have to go out after these unions and break them. And in turn, the stakes for, really, all progressive, all working people, anybody who has a stake in democracy, are very high because this is the first major battle of the new administration. And if they’re able to mass fire federal workers despite their legal protections to have job protections, despite the reality that millions of Americans depend on these services—Social Security, Medicaid, just basic environmental health and safety protections—if they’re able to destroy these services upon which so many people depend, this is going to set a basis for them to then go even harder on the rest of society. So think about immigrants and trans people and all of that. So the implications of this battle are very high. It is the case, fortunately, that federal workers are starting to resist, but there’s going to need to be a lot more to be able to push back. JJ: Well, I grew up outside of DC. Both my parents worked at federal agencies. All of my summer jobs were at federal agencies, and anyone with direct experience knows that, with 0.0 illusions about perfection—but we understand that there are widespread misunderstandings and myths about government, generally, and about federal workers, specifically. Trump says, “We’re bloated, we’re sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job.” How do we push back against that narrative? USA Facts (12/19/24) EB: Yeah, I think the basic response is straightforward, which is to highlight just how important these services are and to note that, far from having a massively expanded bureaucracy, the federal services, like most public services, have actually been starved over the last 50 years. The percentage of the workforce that works for the federal government has continued to decline for the last four decades. And so it’s just not the case that there’s this massively expanding bureaucracy. And if anything, many of the inefficiencies and the problems in the sector are due to a lack of resources and then the lack of ability to really make these the robust programs that they can and should be, and oftentimes in the past were. So it’s just not the case that either there’s a massively expanded bureaucracy or that these services are somehow not important. The reality is that the American people, in some ways, don’t see all of these services. They take them for granted. They’re somewhat invisible. So the fact that, up until recently, planes weren’t crashing, well, that’s because you have federal regulators and have well-trained federal air traffic controllers. And so when you start to destroy these services, then all of a sudden it becomes more visible. What will happen if you stop regulating companies on pollution, for instance? Well, companies can go back and do what they did a hundred years ago, which is to systematically dump toxins into the soil, into water, and all of these other things that we almost take for granted now that are unacceptable. Well, if there’s no checks and balances on corporations, who’s going to prevent them from doing all of this? And so I do think that there’s just a lot of basic education that needs to be put out there to counter these lies, essentially, of the Trump administration. For instance, the vast majority of federal workers don’t live in DC. This idea that this is all sort of rich bureaucrats in DC—over 80% of federal workers live all across the country, outside of DC. And just monetarily, it’s not the case these are people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, they’re making decent working class wages. Overwhelmingly, you can look at the data. So we need to, I think, be really clear both of the importance of these services, but then also just to say it’s a complete myth that the reason that ordinary working class people are suffering is due to federal workers. It’s a tiny part of the federal budget, first of all, the payroll of federal workers. And if you just compare the amount of money that goes to federal workers to, say, the wealth of Elon Musk, there’s no comparison. Elon Musk, richest man on earth, has over $400 billion net worth. That’s almost double what federal workers, 2.3 million federal workers as a whole, make every year. So you just see the actual inequality is not coming from federal workers, it’s coming from the richest in our country and the world. JJ: Well, an arm we have, a lever we have, is worker organizing to push back against this, besides us at home being angry and throwing our shoes at the TV. We can work together and we have historical models, we have contemporary models and examples of how that can work and how that can play out. I want to ask you to talk about the 2018 teacher strikes, because I see that you have lifted that up as a kind of analog, that there are lessons to be learned about places like West Virginia and Oklahoma, red states that in 2018 had this strike by teachers that, against all odds, one would say, were popular, connected with community, and were, in their measure, successful. I wonder what you think some of the tactical lessons were learned there. What did we learn from those strikes? Jacobin (3/9/18) EB: That’s a good question, and I think it’s important to start by just noting that these strikes are a good example of why we shouldn’t just succumb to despair now. There’s an overall sense of doom and gloom that nothing can be done because Trump’s in power, but I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think it’s accurate that nothing can be done. And the example of the red state strikes are a prime indicator that even when you have very conservative people in power, in government, workers have an ability to use their workplace leverage and their community leverage to win. And so in 2018, hundreds of thousands of teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona and beyond went on strike. Even though those strikes were illegal, even though these were states in which the unions are very weak, right-to-work states, and even though the electorates in all of these states had voted for Donald Trump, nevertheless they got overwhelming support from the population because they had very simple, resonant demands, like more funding for schools, decent pay for teachers, make sure that there’s enough money so that students can get a decent education. These things cut across partisan lines in a way that, similarly, I think that the defense of basic services like Social Security and Medicaid today really does cut across party lines. And the tactics, then, that they used were, well, first they had to get over the fear factor, because these were illegal strikes, so they had to find ways to start generating momentum amongst teachers. They did things like really basic escalating actions like asking people to wear red on one day. So they didn’t start by saying, “Let’s go on strike.” They said, “Can you do this one simple action together? Can we all wear the same color on a given day?” And then they asked the community to come in. They said, “Community members, can you meet us after school on this day? We’re going to talk about our issues together. We’re going to hold up some signs. We’re going to provide some information.” So they built with escalating action towards eventually a mass strike. And they used a lot of social media because they couldn’t rely on the unions as much. Social media was very important for connecting workers across these states, for generating momentum. And eventually they were able to have extremely successful walkouts that, despite being illegal, nobody got retaliated against. They won, they forced the government to back down and to meet their demands. And so I do think that that is more or less the game plan for how we’re going to win around Musk and Trump. You have to essentially create enough of a backlash of working people, but then in conjunction with the community, that the politicians are forced to back down. JJ: Well in worker-to-worker organizing, it seems like what you’re talking about here, I think a lot of us who have worked with organized labor or have that memory think of it as a top-down enterprise. And so worker-to-worker organizing is not just like a bright spot, something to look at, but a way forward, something that can be replicated. You direct something called the Worker to Worker Collaborative. Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about what worker-to-worker organizing is or how it’s different from a model that some folks may hold in their head? We Are the Union (UC Press, 2025) EB: Yeah. The basic problem with more traditional, staff-intensive unionism is that it’s just too expensive. It’s too costly, both in terms of money and time, to win big, to organize millions of workers. And whether it’s on offensive battles like unionizing Starbucks or Amazon, or whether it’s defensive battles right now, like defending federal workers, if you’re going to organize enough workers to fight back, there’s just not enough staff to be able to do that. And so part of the problem with the traditional method is that you just can’t win widely enough. You can’t win big enough. Worker-to-worker organizing is essentially the form of organizing in which the types of roles that staff normally do are taken on by workers themselves. So strategizing, training and coaching other workers, initiating campaigns—these are things that then become the task and responsibility of workers themselves with coaching and with support, and oftentimes in conjunction with bigger unions. But workers just take on a higher degree of responsibility, and that has been shown to work. The biggest successes we’ve had in the labor movement in recent years, from the teacher strikes, which we talked about, to Starbucks, which has organized now over 560 stores, forced one of the biggest companies in the world to the bargaining table. We’ve seen that it works. And it’s just a question now of the rest of the labor movement really investing in this type of bottom-up organizing. And frankly, there is no alternative. The idea that so many in the labor leadership have, that we’re just going to elect Democrats and then they’ll turn it around—well, Democrats are sort of missing in action, and who knows when they’re going to come back into power. And so it’s really incumbent on the labor movement to stop looking from above and start looking, really, to its own rank and say, “Okay, if we’re going to save ourselves, that’s the only possible way. No one’s going to come save us from above.” JJ: And it seems that it develops also with just a more organic, if I could say, understanding of what the issues are because it’s workers themselves formulating that message rather than leadership saying, “We think this is what will sell, or we think this is what we can get across.” It seems more likely to actually reflect workers’ real concerns. In These Times, 11/22/24 EB: Yeah, that’s right. I mean, workers are best placed to understand each other’s issues. They’re also the best placed to convince other workers to get on board. One of the things bosses always say whenever there’s a union drive or union fight is, “Oh, the union is this outside third party.” And sometimes there’s a little bit of truth to that. I don’t want to exaggerate the point, but there could be an aspect of the labor movement that can feel a little bit divorced from the direct ownership and experiences of workers. But when workers themselves are organizing, oftentimes in conjunction with unions, but if they really are the people in the lead, then it becomes much harder for the bosses to third-party the union because it’s clear the union is the workers. JJ: Right, right. Well, how much does it matter, for this kind of bottom-up organizing, whatever it is that’s happening at the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board]? What role—I don’t even actually know what’s happening, it’s in flux as is everything. But you think that maybe not that we shouldn’t worry about it, not that we shouldn’t think about it, but we shouldn’t over-worry about machinations at the NLRB, yeah? EB: Well, I do think that the Biden NLRB was very good and it helped workers unionize. So the fact that we don’t have that NLRB anymore is a blow to the labor movement. I think we just have to acknowledge that. That being said, it’s still possible to unionize. You don’t need the NLRB to unionize. The labor movement grew and fought for many years before labor law was passed. And even today it’s very ambiguous. The NLRB is sort of paralyzed on a national level, but on a local level you can still run elections. And so it’s not even completely defunct. And I think it’s probably still possible to use it to a certain extent. But the reality is that the legal terrain is harder than it was. On the other hand, the urgency is even higher, and you still see workers fighting back and organizing in record numbers. I’ve been really heartened by, despite the fact that the legal regime is harder, you’ve had some major union victories just in the last few weeks under Trump. For instance, in Philadelphia, Whole Foods workers unionized despite Trump, despite an intense union busting campaign coming straight on down from Jeff Bezos. This was only the second time Amazon—because Amazon’s the owner of Whole Foods now—has lost a union election, and that was just a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. And so it shows that there is this real anger from below. And I think that there’s something, actually, about the Trump administration, that because it’s so fused to some of the richest people on earth with the administration in an oligarchic manner, but then unionization itself becomes almost a direct way to challenge the Trump regime. Because you’re going up against both their destruction of labor rights, and then also, frankly, it’s just the same people are up top. The bosses and the administration are almost indistinguishable at this point. JJ: And I feel like entities like Amazon, like Whole Foods, have presented themselves as sort of the future of business, the future of the way we do things. And so I think labor actions, first of all, recognizing that it’s still workers doing this and it’s not happening in a lab somewhere, they just seem like especially important places to call attention to in terms of labor activity. Eric Blanc: “I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity.” EB: Yeah. And I think that the Achilles heel of Trump and his whole movement is that it claims to be populist and it appeals to working class people, but in reality is beholden to the richest people on the planet. So the best way to expose that is by waging battles around economic dignity, right? And the labor movement is the number one force that can do that, and force the politicians to show which side they’re on. Are you on the side of Jeff Bezos or are you on the side of low wage workers who are fighting back? Waging more and more of those battles, even if it’s harder because of the legal regime, I think is going to be one of the most crucial ways we have to undermine the support of MAGA amongst working people of all backgrounds. JJ: Well, and we need one another for that support as we go forward. Well, finally, unless you’re living in a hole or unless you actually like what’s happening, it’s very clear that business as usual isn’t going to do, kind of wherever you’re walking in life, we need to be doing something bigger, bolder. But we know that there are people, to put it crudely, who are more afraid of disruption than they are of suffering. Disruption sounds very scary, doing things the way they haven’t been done yesterday, even though we do have history that we can point to, is scary. And I think that makes the stories we tell one another and the stories we tell ourselves so important, the coherence of the vision of the future that we’re able to put out there is so crucial. And of course, that brings me back to media. You mentioned the importance of social media, independent media, just the stories that we tell, the stories that we lift up, the people that we lift up. It seems so important to this fight. It’s not meta phenomena. So I just wonder, finally, what you see as a role for different kinds of media going forward? Federal Unionists Network EB: Okay. I think it’s absolutely crucial. One of the reasons why the right has made the inroads it has is that it’s been better at getting its story out there and waging the battles of ideas through the media, through social media, and through more mainstream media. And frankly, our side has trailed. Maybe it’s because we don’t have the same resources, but I think it’s also there’s an underestimation of how important it is to explain what is going on in the world, to name who the real enemies are, and to provide an explanation for people’s real anger and their real anxiety about what’s happening. So yeah, I think it’s absolutely crucial. And I think we need to, as a labor movement, as progressives, as left, really push back and provide an alternative explanation that all of these problems are rooted in the power of billionaires. It’s not rooted because of the immigrants, not because of the federal workers, not because of trans kids. And I’ll just say that one of the things I find to be hopeful is that social media is being used pretty effectively now by this new federal workers movement, and I’ll give you one plug, which is that they have a new website, go.savepublicservices.com, through which anybody can sign up to get involved in the local actions happening nearby. It’s going to be a rapid response network to stop all of the layoffs that happen locally, wherever you live, and to save the services on which we depend. So people can go to that website, go.savepublicservices.com, and take advantage of that media opportunity to get involved locally. JJ: Alright then, we’ll end on that note.

Title: Twitch's CEO on its biggest competition, Big Tech's growth-at-all-costs mindset, and why Twitter isn't really a town square

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology You have probably heard of Twitch, the company that basically invented livestreaming in the US, and that Amazon bought for $1 billion in 2014. Do you use Twitch? That's a different question. There are now lots of places to watch people do things live on the internet. And some streamers who really broke through on Twitch — like Kai Cenat, or Hasan Piker — spend a lot of time on rival platforms, too. No problem, says Dan Clancy. The Twitch CEO, who's been on the job for two years, says he thinks his platform offers streamers a way to connect with audiences — and, crucially, for audiences to connect with each other — that doesn't exist elsewhere. I had other questions for Clancy, like: When will Twitch actually make money for Amazon? And what happened to plans to port Twitch-like experiences to other places — like NBA games? And in a world where moderation is a political hot button, how does Twitch deal with streamers who talk for hours on end and are often likely to say something that will upset someone? We talked about all that in a recent chat, recorded live at South by Southwest in Austin. You can hear the whole thing on my "Channels" podcast. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. Hasan Piker, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, was recently suspended after making an extended metaphor about the healthcare system that involved killing US Sen. Rick Scott. He's been suspended multiple times. How do you get suspended at Twitch? Do you get involved when it's a high-profile person? Is this automated? How do you get reinstated? So first of all, the suspensions are not indefinite. They're there for a given period of time. Sort of a timeout. Right … to try to make sure people stay within the guardrails. If someone goes outside the guardrails a little, give them a little bit of timeout. So then [streamers know]: "OK. I'm going to work hard to stay within the community guidelines." We have a team that does that. It's not automated. I'll be aware of their decisions for certain high-profile [streamers]. But it's not my decision because the whole point is to keep some degree of separation. Even before last fall's election, we were seeing tech platforms rethinking moderation and rules, and they were moving away from moderation in some cases. Elon Musk led the way on that with Twitter. Now it seems like there's additional political pressure for platforms and media companies. How is that affecting Twitch? We were lucky in that we were not overly aggressive previously. I think sometimes, especially with misinformation and other things, people moved the line. And we had always consistently said, "Listen, you should be free to say what you want. It's how you say it. You can't be spewing hate. You can't be threatening violence … " But you could say, "I want to take ivermectin to deal with my COVID." Correct. We did have a policy [to deal with] someone whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation, but that doesn't really happen on Twitch. We don't have the viral spreading of information. More often than not, what people say on Twitch is a manifestation of what they hear through the other platforms. So someone might say, "Oh, I read a Facebook post the other day that said this." So you've always been sort of looser than some of the other platforms. And it doesn't seem like the Jim Jordans of the world are going after you and subpoenaing you and asking you to explain why you censored so-and-so. Is that because it's just a different platform? Is it because they don't know what Twitch is? No, I think it's because we have not been getting into that space. In general, we have not waded into censoring people. People talk about Twitter as a town square. Twitter's not really a town square because it just spreads all over the place. In a town square, you're either in the town square or you're not. And on a Twitch channel, either you're watching the channel live or you're not. If someone doesn't want to watch the channel, don't watch it. It doesn't algorithmically suddenly appear in their feed. You show up; you watch a channel. If you don't want someone watching your channel, you can ban them and stop them from watching your channel. In the pandemic, a lot of people discovered Twitch, and people spent a lot more time on Twitch. Then there was a rush from YouTube, Microsoft, Facebook to build their own version of Twitch. They offered huge contracts to some of the biggest Twitch streamers. Now they basically have all sort of retreated from that business. Their hope was, "I'll lose money on this creator. But all these users will come." But when that creator left Twitch, there was another creator ready to step up and become the next big thing on Twitch. They filled that void. And so [rival platforms] said, "No, this doesn't work. We're not really pulling [audience] from Twitch. So why do we want to keep losing money on these deals?" So you had deep-pocketed competitors that walked away. Does that mean they concluded they could never compete? Or did they decide this business is not worth it for them and they can get a better return doing something else? It's absolutely the case that the VOD business, like TikTok and YouTube, is a great business. You watch that when you have five minutes here, five minutes there, and you add up the five minutes … it's a great business. I mean, it's bigger than our business. Their thought was, "This will be on top of our business." And they still all do live. It's not like they pulled back from live. They've pulled back from signing money-losing deals. And when you pull back from that artificial injection of capital, Twitch, because it focuses on live, [streamers say]: "No, I'd rather be on Twitch." A while back Twitch was on the radar of media companies, and people like the NBA were saying they wanted their broadcasts to look more like Twitch. They had demos where there was a basketball game going on with all Twitch stuff on the side. It doesn't look like that ever took off. Is that media companies saying, "Actually, we're not really ready for a Twitch-like experience"? Is that the audience saying, "We're not ready for that"? I think it's people misunderstanding what is so special about Twitch. Let's take music. There's a ton of musicians on Twitch. And people said, "I know — we'll put music on Twitch. We're going to film a concert." So you take one concert and you film it. But then the creator isn't interacting with the community online. It's not distinctly different than what you can watch in a VOD, right? And it happens once. So the people are not building community among themselves. The musicians that use Twitch — they often use Twitch more to engage with their audience and community and doing whatever they do in their free time. The poster child example is T-Pain, who's a big musician who streams on Twitch all the time. I'll chat with him and hang out with him on Twitch, and he games on Twitch. He does his sound recording on Twitch. The point is, it's not about taking traditional music media and sticking chat next to it. That doesn't create community. That is just traditional premium media with people chatting alongside, which they already do on Twitter. Two years ago, you became the Twitch CEO. Then you had layoffs. Then you said Twitch wasn't profitable, which is why you made the cuts. It's kind of shocking to hear that between Amazon's resources and Twitch's cultural cachet that Twitch wasn't making money. Is it making money now? So I don't talk about where we're at now. But when you say it's shocking — it's not that shocking. Uber didn't make money until last year. Yes, but they were in a different business. And YouTube was making money — not right away, but … I was at YouTube from 2010 to 2012. For a long time, YouTube was not profitable. So I don't think it's that strange. I think this is an issue in the tech space, where there is this mindset of, "Build your organization for where you're going to be in three or four years." That came out of Google, in part because Google was lucky enough to have a money machine in the back of the house. So everyone else — it was like grow, grow, grow. Get a big team. Get a big team. And to be honest, part of what happened to Twitch, they kind of fell into that at Amazon. The Twitch team, when they first got there, they were very scrappy. And then people would come and say, "No, no, no, that's not the game here. You have to argue for more resources." And having been in Big Tech, that is the game: How do you argue for more resources? As opposed to: How do you figure out what is the number you need to serve your audience in your community? And so we were just like many other folks in tech. We were just not running the business as well as we could have. Jump to

Title: Ryan Breslow Settles Lawsuits After Returning As Bolt CEO: ‘I Made A Ton Of Mistakes’

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin , Forbes Staff. Bolt's Ryan Breslow is back as the CEO of the payment startup he cofounded after a string of legal disputes with investors were settled. Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Mark Cuban wants to 'out-Elon' Elon Musk and plug a hole created by DOGE

“Shark Tank” star and entrepreneur Mark Cuban knows a thing or two about getting a new business up and running. His next venture may be hiring the workers laid off by Tesla (TSLA-4.63%) CEO Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Cuban has been reviewing pitches for a new business from former and current employees at the General Services Administration (GSA) and the White House, he told Politico. His eventual goal is to back some of those potential companies and help their workers leverage the skills they developed while working at the federal government as a contractor. “I think it’s possible to out-Elon, Elon, because the people he will bring in don’t know what they don’t know,” Cuban told Politico. The new venture would take former employees of the U.S. Digital Service, who served as an in-house consultant for federal agencies on information technology. The group was rebranded as DOGE by President Donald Trump’s executive order establishing Musk’s group. In February, 21 staffers said they would resign instead of helping DOGE slash federal spending, including through mass layoffs. Those employees, all of whom previously had senior jobs at tech giants like Amazon (AMZN-0.27%) or Alphabet’s (GOOGL-0.22%) Google, warned that the people Musk hired were political ideologues who lacked the necessary skills to carry out Musk’s vision, The Associated Press reported. Cuban would also enlist former workers at the 18F unit housed within GSA, which was charged with modernizing and building critical tech services for the government, including public-facing services like Login.gov and guides for federal and state agencies. The unit was dissolved on March 1. “A couple have a real chance to turn into small companies that can leverage their expertise,” Cuban told Politico, referring to some of the workers. Cuban envisions his tech company as profitable, although it’s unclear how that would be achieved. Federal agencies determine how much can be outsourced to the private sector and at what cost, and the Trump administration hasn’t shown an interest in remaking either 18F or USDS, according to Politico. 18F has also had a rocky history with finances. The unit fell millions of dollars short of its own revenue projections over its first three fiscal years and took home no revenue during its first year of operation, according to a 2016 report from the inspector general of the GSA. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer now leading Technology Transformation Services, told staff that 18F “was not and has not been fully cost coverable,” according to FedScoop. In fiscal year 2024, the program was $18 million short and lost $5 million in fiscal 2025. “Despite the losses the team was incurring, 18F with their recent hourly prices were on the very high end of the technology consulting market,” Shedd said. Cuban told Politico that the new company would have to generate private sector revenue in addition to federal dollars. It would also likely have to rely on state and local deals until a friendlier federal government is in place, a former 18F staffer told Politico.

Title: FTC seeks delay in Amazon Prime lawsuit, blames Musk's federal layoffs
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/107127-ftc-seeks-delay-amazon-prime-lawsuit-blames-musk.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:16:00Z
Full Content:
In a nutshell: The FTC wants a judge to delay the agency's trial against Amazon over allegations it used deceptive marketing practices for its Prime subscription program. The reason for the request is that Elon Musk and the Trump administration's layoffs of federal workers has left the FTC short on employees and funds. The FTC said in its 2023 complaint against Amazon that the company knowingly tricks people into signing up for Prime through the use of "Dark Patterns," a reference to the number of options at the checkout suggesting people sign up for automatically renewing Prime subscriptions. It also alleged that canceling the subscription is a task involving multiple unnecessary steps, which could cause some people to give up before the end. A trial was due to begin in September, but FTC lawyer Jonathan Cohen has asked US District Judge John Chun to postpone it by two months. "Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment," Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday, via Associated Press. "We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team." Cohen confirmed to the judge that the FTC's resource challenges stemmed from the recent cuts made to federal government employees. Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has laid off over 62,500 federal workers since its inception. Cohen said some FTC employees had chosen to leave in January after DOGE's "Fork in the Road" email, which offered a deferred resignation program that allowed employees to announce their resignation effective September 30, 2025. In return, participants would retain full pay and benefits until that date. Adding to the staffing problems has been the government hiring freeze, which Cohen said has prevented the FTC from replacing staff members who resigned for other reasons. Cohen said the FTC doesn't want to push the trial date back by more than a couple of months, but he still couldn't guarantee it would be enough time for the agency to address its issues. He couldn't even guarantee that things won't be worse by November. The FTC's legal team is "racing at considerable cost" to meet a late April deadline for discovery, Cohen said. It is also dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel. Amazon doesn't want the delay. One of its attorneys said most of the FTC's legal team assigned to the case were still employed by the agency, and that the FTC lacks grounds for a delay. Amazon denies it engaged in deceptive practices related to its Prime subscription service. If the FTC wins the suit, Amazon could potentially refund affected Prime customers.
