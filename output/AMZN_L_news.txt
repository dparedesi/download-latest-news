© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.” To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.” It’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.” This “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.” Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.” Thiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. “Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.” The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.” William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.” In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. “There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.” Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.” The American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.” A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.” This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters. “‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.” The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.” Voices Sunjeev Bery Democrats are in disarray.

AI and automation are increasingly threatening marketing jobs; but one skill stands out as a career safeguard: SQL (Structured Query Language). While it might sound technical, SQL has become an indispensable tool for modern marketers who want to stay competitive and drive data-informed decisions. SQL’s true power lies in its near-universal adoption across modern data platforms and marketing tools. You’ll find SQL powering queries in Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s Audience Builder, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Snowflake, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, SAP HANA, Adobe Analytics, HubSpot’s custom reporting, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, Shopify’s analytics, MongoDB (via SQL API), Teradata, MariaDB, SQLite, Vertica, Databricks SQL, Presto, Apache Hive, Apache Phoenix, SingleStore, CockroachDB, Cassandra (via SQL-like CQL), and virtually every major CMS and CDP. Marketing platforms have embraced SQL because it offers a standardized data access method. While each platform might have slight syntax variations or special functions, the core SQL concepts remain remarkably consistent. Once you learn SQL, you can work with data across virtually any marketing technology stack – from email marketing platforms to enterprise data warehouses. Born in the 1970s at IBM, SQL was initially designed to manage and query relational databases. What started as a specialized tool for database administrators has evolved into the universal data language. Today, SQL powers everything from small business databases to massive enterprise systems, making it the world’s most widely used database language. The marketing landscape has dramatically shifted.

[singing] everybody must carve stone... “Cheating...” Fair enough. But the same could probably have been said with the introduction of any new technology to the field. The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo’s David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I’d imagine that there’ll be a market for that sort of thing. all the time or just rainy days? You miss the point. Reproductions/replicas are not art, they are copies. There’s a robotic bumbershoot that helps with that. Perfect counterfeits, and if from same quarry, who can tell? You miss the point. I never said that such things weren’t copies. Are you saying if I take a picture of the mona lisa or do a step by step “paint by numbers” copy - that’s it’s different than creating the original work of art? “The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels.” True... but at least he had to sculpt. He couldn’t go into town for a sandwich and let the power tools do it all. Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That’s not to say that AI-created designs wouldn’t also be possible. If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let’s keep raising that minimum wage! Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

Title: How the entrepreneurs behind Verb built a rapidly growing agency from scratch

Advertisement November 14, 2024 | 6 min read Listen to article 4 min Winning Gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category is Verb. Here's how, in its own words, it went from nothing to industry-leading in six years. How agency Verb won gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category / Credit: Verb “Okay, we have three months before we have to go get a job.” In 2018, armed with only their bank accounts and credit cards, Shannon Jones and Yadira Harrison had left their roles at an experiential marketing agency with the goal of truly making inspiring and different work. They calculated that they could keep their business afloat for 100 days before they’d need to do something else. Three days later, they signed Nielsen, Amazon and Lyft. Fast-forward to now: Shannon, Yadira and the 85-person strong Verb team is regularly turning out headline-grabbing work that leaks on Reddit and breaks on TMZ. This top-of-line work includes the Hello Seven Millionaire Summit 2024, back for its second year after 99% attendee satisfaction in 2023. Shannon and Yadira architected the summit alongside visionary founder and author Rachel Rodgers. Held in Puerto Rico, it brought together IRL Hello Seven’s diverse and inclusive community to network and learn financial and business advice. Here's another one: the launch of seven 'Airbnb Icon' experiences in one week, including the now-famous floating Up house. After the launch of over 15 'Only On Airbnb' activations and the wild success of Barbie’s Dreamhouse in 2023, Verb was tapped for more. In summer of 2024, Verb successfully launched The Up House, The X-Men Mansion, The Inside Out House, Edna’s Mansion from The Incredibles and the Feid Tour Experience. From The New York Times, The Today Show, TIME and CNN to Designboom and Dezeen; everyone was sharing Verb’s hard work launching the Icons as a new Airbnb product offering. The numbers speak for themselves. While contacts with clients were being rapidly let go in 2023, Verb maintained 100% of their staff and hired an additional 50 team members. In 2024, the agency is tracking for 320% revenue growth. Advertisement The way Shannon and Yadira create an authentic team truly sets Verb apart, with an internal culture that not only allows employees to thrive, but to excel in their fields. During 2023, when projects were being canceled and then reinstated during a period of high turnover across the industry, Verb doubled down on internal culture, maintaining the small-agency, everyone-fits-inside-one-car culture while adding new team members. Having no layoffs in 2024 helped ensure that the team would see the other side of the uncertainty. Verb has never operated with hierarchy or titles in mind. As shared by Yadira’s former executive assistant (now member of the creative team) Alex Rodberg, “Yadira invited me to contribute my ideas for a new project. Despite my initial apprehensions, Yadira saw something in me that I didn't recognize in myself – a potential to think outside the box and bring fresh ideas to the table.” Verb has never had to create DE&I goals. From its roots in 2018, diversity has been an innate component of the agency. The team spans four generations, with senior leaders as young as 26. When a prospective client asked to see resumes and portfolios for the entire Verb team, Shannon and Yadira pushed back. Verb doesn’t require that information for hiring (one team member used to work for Beyonce. Who needs more of a resume than that?). They did, however, ultimately collect resumes out of curiosity and found that many of their team members had advanced degrees in other fields. Advertisement As of March 2023, the team is led by a minority-majority, with women and people of color at the helm. Verb has created a space where code-switching is dropped at the door, and all are safe to express and present themselves as they truly are. As Kindra Meyer, Verb’s recently acquired executive creative director attests: “Shannon and Yadira have quietly, just by their nature, created a revolution at Verb. They built from a foundational need to create a space they could empower others and open doors, the antithesis of what they experienced in the industry.” Through creative expertise and vision, Shannon and Yadira have proven their ingenuity and forward-thinking as entrepreneurs. That has never been more evident than when looking at the work created in the past year. At the helm of Verb, this duo is raising industry standards in creativity, execution and commitment to excellence. Today, six years on and tracking to at least triple year-on-year revenue while growing their outstanding team, Shannon and Yadira are facing the biggest challenge many entrepreneurs face: the business is not just theirs anymore. The new leadership team is looking to rebrand Verb and take the company past the referral-only model. But that’s also the mark of a great business — one where everyone feels ownership and wants to bring out the best in themselves and others. “The green is staying though, that’s all I want,” said Shannon.

Title: Both men and women will switch jobs for higher pay—but what it takes to keep them is different for each group

Good morning! Employers right now may have the upper hand when it comes to hiring, but many employees are still eyeing the exit. That means that business leaders and HR managers still have to think hard about ways to engage their workforces—but not every group is motivated by the same perks. Overall, about 54% of employees have no plans to leave their current company or role in 2024—a slight uptick from 52% in 2023, according to a new report from Alight, a consulting technology company. But the top motivators to stay are different for men and women. Around 21% of women rank satisfaction with their work-life flexibility as the main reason they’re sticking around. Meanwhile, only 10% of men surveyed said the same. Yet 13% of both women and men listed job or company stability as their main motivator, signaling security is a priority all around. “It’s important to understand your retention and attraction efforts as an employer should be different. It’s not one-size-fits-all,” Laine Thomas Conway, VP of engagement services strategy at Alight, tells Fortune. When it comes to what would make a worker consider a new job with another company, women and men are generally in agreement: higher pay. But the topic is even more important for women, with around 46% ranking higher wages as the primary reason they would leave, compared to 39% of men, according to the report. “When we’re looking at job stability and jumping for pay, it’s really important to know that women feel much more challenged about their budgets and savings, and that they definitely need more help,” Thomas Conway says. “Employers [need to] make sure that they are promoting the tools that are going to make women feel more confident in their futures, in their day-to-day budgeting, and how they are navigating the world.” Emma Burleigh emma.burleigh@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Brit Morse.

Some cases making their way through federal courts could have catastrophic consequences for minority-owned businesses that do work for the federal government.

The company had been working to launch a fertility monitoring device and companion smartphone app for the past four years as part of a project codenamed "Encore," said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press. The team sat within Amazon's Grand Challenge, also known as its Special Projects division, the sources said. In October, Amazon told people working on the tracker that it was disbanding the team. Those being laid off will remain on Amazon's payroll until Dec. 27, but won't be expected to work during that time, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. If staffers don't secure another job by that date, Amazon will provide them with a "lump sum" severance payment equal to one week of salary for every six months of tenure at the company, the documents said. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been reeling in costs companywide since late 2022, when inflationary pressures and rising interest rates led to a slowdown across the tech and consumer markets. In addition to slashing more than 27,000 jobs, Jassy has shuttered several projects, ranging from a roving sidewalk robot to a telehealth offering and a rapid delivery service. The wave of frugality marks a distinct departure from the approach taken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy's predecessor, who was known for greenlighting experimental projects and giving employees extended runway to develop them, even if they burned cash along the way. Grand Challenge was one of the hallmarks of that era. Bezos launched Grand Challenge in 2014 as a way for Amazon to tinker with riskier projects that may or may not see the light of day. Grand Challenge was the brains behind a pair of connected eyeglasses equipped with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and a machine learning tool for analyzing medical records. Other Grand Challenge projects, including the Amazon Care telehealth service, a video-calling device for kids, a virtual tours service, and an augmented reality headset for meetings, were discontinued. On the morning of Oct. 28, employees working on the fertility tracker were told to join a videoconference where a director of the team informed them that the project was ending. The call lasted about two minutes, one of the people said. A layoff notice viewed by CNBC was signed by Doug Weibel, who took over as the head of Grand Challenge after its founding leader, Babak Parviz, left in 2022 and joined Madrona Venture Group. Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, confirmed the layoffs and the existence of the project in a statement to CNBC. Roughly 100 employees will be laid off, Callahan confirmed. "We regularly review our businesses to ensure we focus on areas where we can make the biggest difference for customers," Callahan said. "Following a recent review, we've decided to discontinue this project within Grand Challenge, and we're working directly with employees whose roles are impacted to support them through the transition and help them find other opportunities within Amazon." The project was born out of the company's 2020 acquisition of Wisconsin-based startup bluDiagnostics, the sources said. BluDiagnostics was founded in 2015 by Weibel, Katie Brenner and Jodi Schroll, all of whom joined Grand Challenge. The startup had developed a thermometer-like device, called FertilityFinder, to help women track their fertility from home by testing their saliva and measuring two key hormones, estradiol and progesterone. The results of the test were viewable through a corresponding app. Business Insider reported on aspects of the fertility device in 2022, when its codename was Project Tiberius. The team was working to develop its own saliva collection device and mobile app, which could predict when a user might be in the fertile window. Users could also log their period symptoms, sexual activity and other data to assist with tracking their fertility. There are similar offerings on the market from companies including Inne, Oova, Ava and Mira, along with fertility and ovulation tracking apps such as Flo, Clue and Max Levchin's Glow. Amazon initially aimed to release the product this year, but the timing was pushed out after the team encountered technical issues with the device, one of the people said. It was a costly endeavor and required significant upfront investments for lab research and development, in addition to the high salaries for scientists and engineers, the sources said, adding that the team's weekly overhead was roughly $1.5 million. Amazon didn't comment on the figure. Only one project now remains active within Grand Challenge. Its focus is on health tech, the people said.

Title: Saudi Arabia's futuristic city just faced another setback, but the country still has its eyes on being an AI leader
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-setback-neom-ceo-stepped-down-ai-investment-2024-11

Hello there! Already thinking about holiday shopping? Maybe this Apple coffee-table book could be good for the music lover in your life. Be warned: It's not cheap, and there won't be a ton of them made. In today's big story, Saudi Arabia's futuristic city, which is part of its big modernization plans, just got another reality check. What's on deck: If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Saudi Arabia's dreams of the future are facing the realities of the present. The CEO of the Kingdom's futuristic city, Neom, abruptly stepped down after six years in the role. It's another setback for the country's ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy away from relying on oil and make it an attractive tourist destination. Neom is arguably the most high-profile portion of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan. Even if you haven't been closely following the project, you've likely seen mockups of the twin mirrored skyscrapers dubbed "The Line" that look like a massive wall running through the desert. But Neom is having an "Instagram vs. reality" moment … literally. Influencers and vloggers who posted videos of their lives in the yet-to-be-completed city were mostly mocked in what one viewer described as having "low security prison vibes." Grand plans also don't come cheap. Estimates for Neom have swelled to as much as $1.5 trillion. Saudi has already invested $1.3 trillion in the wider Vision 2030 project. Foreign investments in the plan haven't panned out the way Saudi hoped either, leading the Kingdom to look to China for help with the bill. The move is part of the deepening financial ties between the two countries, which poses a potential threat to the US. Saudi Arabia's big plans also include tech's biggest prize: AI. The Kingdom has spent years investing billions in the tech, including the recent creation of a $40 billion fund dedicated to AI investments. But it's also looking to develop the tech in its home country, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. Saudi Arabia's approach to AI isn't unlike the role it plays as an energy giant: Provide the fuel others rely on to make their projects go. "Project Transcendence" includes building all-important data centers in the country and serving as the Middle East AI hub for tech giants. AWS has already committed more than $5 billion to building data centers in the country. It's not alone, though. The United Arab Emirates is aiming to be the AI leader in the region by 2031.

Title: Amazon is shuttering Freevee and some insiders fear layoffs could be coming in the tech giant's entertainment arm
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-shuttering-freevee-some-insiders-speculate-potential-entertainment-layoffs-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-13T13:29:28Z
Full Content:
Amazon is phasing out its free-to-watch streaming service Freevee as insiders speculate about potential layoffs in the tech giant's entertainment arm. Amazon said Freevee's shows, including new episodes and library originals of shows like "Bosch," "Jury Duty," and "Judy Justice," would be available for free to non-Prime members on Prime Video. A sampling of other popular library originals also will be available for free, including the first season of "The Summer I Turned Pretty" and the first three seasons of "The Boys," which could help entice non-Prime members to eventually subscribe to the paid version. The Freevee phaseout is expected to take place over the coming weeks. "To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding," an Amazon rep said in a statement. "There will be no change to the content available for Prime members, and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels — all available on Prime Video." The phaseout comes as three Amazon insiders told BI they believe MGM Studios could soon be hit by layoffs as the company looks to cut costs. Amazon said no Freevee employees were laid off as part of the phaseout as they were absorbed into other entertainment teams but didn't comment on the potential for broader layoffs. Speculation has centered on former Freevee employees as well as MGM Studios' development and unscripted teams. Amazon already cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams earlier this year. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up 14% from 2022 (though that increase is lower than the 28% jump it had the previous year). Before this latest move to shutter Freevee, Amazon had quietly been winding down the service for months, even as the company publicly denied it would completely shut down. It stopped greenlighting new Freevee originals and had been moving some Freevee employees to other parts of MGM Studios. Lauren Anderson, who headed up content for Freevee, moved in May into a role helping sell sponsorships and developing brand-supported originals for Prime Video. Freevee began in 2019 as IMDb TV and rebranded in 2022 as it ramped up original content production. It was part of a trend of free streaming TV services along with Fox-owned Tubi and Paramount's PlutoTV. The service had struggled to carve out an identity for itself and lost money, people familiar with the business previously told BI. It produced few hits except for James Marsden-starring "Jury Duty," which was nominated for two Emmys. It also competed for resources with Prime Video and created brand confusion with some viewers. When Amazon launched ads across Prime Video in January, throwing a splashy upfront event to pitch them, it created further questions about ad-supported Freevee's future as a stand-alone service.

Brands in ecommerce have the wonderful advantage of having access to a broader number of consumers than their local counterparts. Before you can woo a broader base of consumers, it is important to recognize the diversity that exists among them, and the intention required to convert them. I’m an inclusive marketing strategist and run an inclusive marketing consultancy. Last year I did audits of multiple ecommerce websites, and found the same opportunities for improvement over and over again from the perspective of how brands can do a better job of converting more of their ideal consumers who are part of underrepresented and underserved communities. Consumers, no matter their identity, are looking for an answer to this fundamental question: is this brand for people like me? There are three core areas that signal to a consumer whether or not a brand is for them or not. And as a result of those signals, the consumer will make a decision whether or not to take the next step forward with you, or not. Download this ecommerce kit for free marketing, sales planning, and abandoned cart email templates. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. The people you want to serve need to see themselves, or who they aspire to be, reflected in the visual imagery your brand puts forth. When they see themselves represented in the models you use, in your customer testimonials, or even imagery of your team, they receive a signal from you that communicates “people like me belong here.” When they don’t see themselves represented, the signal they receive is, “This brand isn’t for you.” Delivering experiences that have as little friction as possible for the people you serve, especially those with identities that are part of underrepresented and underserved communities, will demonstrate to them that you’ve taken the time to consider them to ensure they feel like they belong with you. One of the most effective ways to eliminate friction in your customer experience, is to design your ecommerce user experience with specific identities in mind. By considering the various types of identities your ideal customers hold in the design and development process, it makes it easier for you to incorporate elements that make people with those identities feel seen, supported, and like they belong with you. If you need additional resources to help you with your ecommerce strategy, check out this Ecommerce Planning Kit from HubSpot. Here are eight examples of ecommerce websites that have done a good job of designing for the needs of consumers with specific underrepresented and underserved identities. Smart marketers know that people who have the problem their brands solve don’t just live in one country or speak one language. As such, it is helpful to showcase to these consumers immediately when they land on your website that your brand is for them. Business card print house Moo does it by placing an option in the main navigation of its website that enables site visitors to select which country they are in, and the associated language they need. Based on the selection, the website automatically changes to the country’s corresponding language. Image Source Retailer Farm Rio takes a similar approach. Consumers are able to select which country they live in from the main navigation. Once confirmed, pricing and shipping options for the clothing items change to reflect the local currency of where the consumer is shopping from. In this image, the country selected is Morocco, and prices are shown in their currency, the Dirham. Image Source Having to do a price conversion adds unnecessary friction, and sends a strong signal that “This brand isn’t for me.” This episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast details how to build an effective multilingual content strategy so you can attract more people who speak other languages to your website. 00:00/00:00 Just because someone has a disability, that doesn’t mean that they don’t enjoy wearing stylish clothes. 15% of the world’s population has some form of disability. As such, making your website accessible enables you to support the needs of a broader group of people, while delivering an experience with less friction. Fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana has embraced accessibility, by making it so website visitors can adjust accessibility settings to suit their needs. Image Source Estimates show that between 15-20% of the population is neurodivergent, including people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and sensory processing disorder. Amazon is a brand that is making an intentional effort to serve these consumers. In this video, three neurodiversity consultants, who are also consumers, share the ways in which Amazon delivers an experience that supports their needs. You can catch the full discussion on how brands can design experiences that work for neurodivergent consumers on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 Smart brands demonstrate to the LGBTQ+ community that they are seen, supported, and belong all year long, rather than just with PRIDE month limited edition products and rainbows. Retailer Calvin Klein does it by showcasing a broad diversity of masculinity in the models it features on its website. Here’s how one gay male consumer explained why that range of representation is important to him. Another way ecommerce brands can show support to the LGBTQ+ community is in how products are classified. Fenty Beauty made its skincare line gender neutral, so there was no need to label products being for “men” or “women” which can exclude people who are non-binary. The brand even goes as far to showcase gender diversity in the models using the products. Image Source And underwear brand Bonds has done it by offering a gender-free line of its clothes. Image Source You can find more tips on how to build an LGBTQ+ inclusive brand on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 Many restaurants now have an ecommerce arm to their business, as they start asking, and even encouraging, people to grab takeout via online ordering. As someone with dietary restrictions, I’ve always been reluctant to embrace the convenience of ordering food online, for fear of the staff not seeing my write-in requests for accommodations with my food. Cooper’s Hawk has addressed this fear. Within the online ordering section, they’ve created separate products that are labeled gluten-free. Even the name of the product has a “GF” at the end, so me or anyone else with a gluten-free restriction doesn’t have to write anything in and pray the notes were read. Image Source The brand takes a similar approach to vegan items on the vegetarian menu. A person can feel reassured that their food will in fact be vegan because it is labeled on the website as, “Vegan Sweet Corn & Tomato Risotto” Image Source The average clothing for a woman in the US and the UK is 16-18. But too often, the models showcasing clothing on ecommerce retail sites are models who wear much smaller sizes. Savage X Fenty takes a different approach. The brand features a broad range of diversity in the models it uses, including a range of body sizes and types. Image Source And when it comes time for consumers to select their size, they don’t have to deal with being labeled “plus-sized" as other retailers often do. They just select from the broad range of sizes offered by the brand. There are many different identities your consumers have when it comes to race and ethnicity. As such, when you’re thinking about the people you feature on your website, make sure you include a range of models that reflect those races and ethnicities. Pro tip: Don’t opt for trying to use models who are racially ambiguous to try to appeal to the broadest range of consumers. It actually has the opposite effect, and frustrates people (often those of darker complexions) who often don’t see themselves represented. Retailer David’s Bridal does this on their website, by highlighting a broad diversity of races and ethnicities with their models that is reflective of the people who buy their dresses. Image Source Image Source Image Source Consumers who have the problem your brand solves will also have a diversity of religious affiliations, traditions, and celebrations. While most brands lean hard into traditional Christian holidays, such as Christmas, more brands are starting to add additional holidays to the ones they celebrate. Ikea has added products for Diwali, to see and serve consumers who celebrate it. Image Source And consumers appreciate that IKEA has products for them. There’s plenty of videos on YouTube of people showing their Diwali hauls from IKEA. There’s no downside to doing so. The more people you’re able to send clear signals that “you belong here” through your intentional design and user experience choices, the more people you’ll be able to convert.

Title: Intel is far from becoming the American chipmaking powerhouse the US needs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-chip-troubles-problem-us-economy-domestic-production-chips-act-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-13T10:00:02Z
Full Content:
US government officials are counting on Intel to lead the country's chip manufacturing renaissance but the company is struggling to meet expectations. Intel becoming a globally competitive US chip manufacturer is "imperative for the US economy and national security," said Stephen Ezell, the vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and the director of its Center for Life Sciences Innovation. That's because the US needs to secure its domestic supply chains of the chips that power items like iPhones, washing machines, and military equipment. When it comes to bringing advanced chip manufacturing to American shores, the US government is short on options. Jimmy Goodrich, senior advisor for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation, told BI that only three companies in the world are manufacturing the most advanced, "leading edge" chips: Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. Intel is the only company in this trio that is based in America — Samsung's headquarters are in South Korea and TSMC is based in Taiwan. If Intel falls short, there is "reasonable concern that advanced fabs will not be sustainably available in the US," said Dylan Patel, the chief analyst at the semiconductor research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis. While Samsung is building a chip factory in Taylor, Texas the company has postponed taking deliveries of chipmaking equipment because it has yet to land any major customers for the project, Reuters reported in October. TSMC is producing chips for Apple in its Phoenix-based factory and has plans to build two more factories in the city. However, the company has historically preferred to invest in Taiwan, Patel said. These conditions are why Intel's recent struggles have raised concerns among some government officials. In August, the company announced it would be parting ways with roughly 15,000 workers through voluntary separation agreements and layoffs. On October 31, the company reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, driven by big restructuring and impairment charges. The company's financial performance has also been hindered by slowing demand for the chips that power personal computers and struggles to gain market share in the booming AI chips sector. To be sure, Intel's third-quarter revenue beat expectations, and executives said the company is making progress on executing a turnaround plan. In September, Intel announced it will be expanding its collaboration with Amazon Web Services, and the company is optimistic that its new 18A chip —which it's expected to start producing next year — will help it gain market share in the industry. However, industry analysts told Business Insider that competing with the likes of TSMC and Nvidia will be an uphill battle — in part due to a series of strategic missteps Intel has made over the past two decades. Another potential wild card is whether a Trump administration — specifically its proposed tariff policies — would aid or hinder Intel's turnaround efforts. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for boosting domestic chip manufacturing but has criticized the CHIPS Act, a key Biden administration initiative that companies like Intel are counting on for funding. An Intel spokesperson told BI that the company's recent quarterly earnings demonstrate the "tangible progress" the company is making on its turnaround strategy. They added that the goal of making the US a leader in semiconductor manufacturing was a priority in the first Trump administration and continues to have bipartisan support. "We look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his administration to advance America's technology and manufacturing leadership," they said. The stakes aren't just high for Intel employees and executives: Intel is the largest recipient of funding from the CHIPS Act, which included $52.7 billion in tax breaks and subsidies intended to bolster the US semiconductor industry. The Biden administration bet that boosting domestic chip manufacturing would make the US less reliant on chips sourced abroad from TSMC, which produces, by some estimates, about 90% of the world's advanced chips. Additionally, fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan complicate the US's dependence on TSMC. Intel was awarded $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in loans through the CHIPS Act, which it plans to use to supplement the over $100 billion it's committed to expanding its operations in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon. Like most companies, Intel hasn't received any of these funds yet. Recipients are required to meet certain benchmarks — which can include building a chip fab or securing customers — before the funding is doled out. Intel has been in discussions with the US government over the milestones it must hit once its funding agreement is finalized, The New York Times reported in October. In response to the company's struggles, government officials have discussed whether it should receive additional financial support or merge its chip design business with a competitor. Last month, The New York Times reported that Gina Raimondo, the US secretary of commerce, urged chief executives from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and other firms to buy chips from Intel. "Our Q3 results underscore the solid progress we are making against the plan we outlined last quarter to reduce costs, simplify our portfolio, and improve organizational efficiency," CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the company's earnings call on October 31.

Title: Amazon is shutting down its free video streaming service, but there’s good news

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onNovember 13, 2024 Amazon Freevee first debuted in 2019 as IMDb Freedive. Since then, the service has offered viewers in select countries, including the US and UK, a limited, ad-supported catalog of TV shows at no cost. With Amazon now focusing on Prime Video, though, it will be phasing out Freevee in the coming weeks. According to Deadline, Amazon is retiring Freevee and redirecting users to Prime Video instead. The company will continue offering its original Freevee shows, such as Judy Justice and High School, through its Prime Video platform. Such content will be marked with a “Watch for Free” label, making it easy for free, non-Prime users to find and view them. An Amazon spokesperson told Deadline: Rumors about this move surfaced earlier this year when Amazon brought ads to Prime Video. With both Amazon-owned platforms now similarly offering ad-supported tiers, it makes little sense to maintain them separately. Behind the scenes, Freevee’s content and business teams have already been integrated into Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video, respectively. As a result, Amazon isn’t expected to lay off any of them for the time being. In a sense, the move is more of a merger between the two streaming platforms rather than a complete shutdown. It remains unclear whether the free content will eventually be available in more countries and regions as part of Amazon Prime Video.

Title: Amazon Shutting Down Freevee Streaming Service (But There’s Good News)

By Nicole Drum Amazon’s free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee is shutting down — but it’s not all bad news for fans of the platform. According to Deadline, Amazon is phasing out Freevee over the next few weeks and has already migrated Freevee content to Prime Video. New episodes of Freevee series, such as Judy Justice, Neighbours, Tribunal Justice, America’s Test Kitchen: The Next Generation and Bosch: Legacy will all be available for non-Prime customers, as will older originals including Jury Duty, High School, Hollywood Houselift with Jeff Lewis and Primo. What this means is for customers where Freevee is available — the U.S., U.K. Germany, and Austria — content labeled Freevee will now be designated as “Watch for Free” for non-Prime customers, meaning that you do not have to have an Amazon Prime membership to be able to watch. Additionally, samples of Prime Video originals, such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and first episodes of The Boys and Fallout, are expected to continue to be available in front of the Prime paywall as well for customers. Based on a statement from an Amazon spokesperson, the phasing out of Freevee is largely a branding measure. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content form other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST Channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering,” the spokesperson said. “To deliver a simpler viewing experience for customers, we have decided to phase out Freevee branding. There will be no change to the content available for prime members and a vast offering of free streaming content will still be accessible for non-Prime members, including select Originals from Amazon MGM Studios, a variety of licensed movies and series, and a broad library of FAST Channels — all available on Prime Video.” Freevee originally launched in January 2019 as IMDb Freedive before becoming IMDbTV that June. It was rebranded as Amazon Freevee in April 2022. Back in February, reports began to surface that Amazon was looking to shutter Freevee and shift focus to Prime Video, but such reports were denied by Amazon at that time. As for the company, it is being reported that no layoffs connected to the move are anticipated. The Freevee content team had previously been integrated into Amazon MGM Studios while its business team was already a part of Prime Video.
