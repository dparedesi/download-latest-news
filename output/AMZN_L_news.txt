Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily After a holiday season of decent gains, retailers expect more of the same in 2026 with most facets of the economy seen holding up. Considering the world is in turmoil, economic uncertainties persist, and Saks Global has gone bankrupt, this week’s NRF Big Show at Manhattan’s Javits Center was a surprisingly reassuring place to be. Resilient consumer spending, the rise of AI, waning fear over tariffs, and expectations for retail gains in the year ahead following a decent 2025 holiday season set a promising tone at the convention/trade show, considered the industry’s biggest. Adding to the upbeat atmosphere were the keynoters recounting personal and professional success stories and the record turnout — 40,000-plus retailers, vendors, suppliers, media, industry analysts and consultants — creating crowds at the doughnut and coffee stands and competition for seats close to the speaker stages.

They centered on inflation persisting; lower-income families struggling to get by amid high grocery, housing and health costs, and the potential impact of AI on the labor force. You May Also Like “It was a good holiday season overall, up 4.7 percent from October through December. It looked to us that people shopped early, were picky and selective. The wealth effect is a huge part of the story, kind of masking the weakness in lower incomes,” said David Tinsley, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, during a economic outlook session. “You can have a relatively weak lower-income consumer but still have a robust outcome. There’s a tenuous relationship between consumer sentiment and what people actually do. I suspect you have pretty depressed consumers along with pretty robust consumption.” For 2026, “It’s not all pessimism for the lower-income consumer,” Tinsley said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill could be quite significant, with an increase in tax refunds between $60 billion and $80 billion. We could see quite large increases in spending on discretionary goods, travel and leisure, but it’s hard to know how it falls out in terms of who will benefit. There is some hope this K-shape economy narrows a bit. One area that gives me concern is the housing market. You need housing transactions to generate demand for all sorts of goods and services.” Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said, “The stock market was a powerful stimulus in the back half of the year. The overall economy is growing strongly. We forecast that to continue this year.” Though he’s concerned about slow job growth, on the positive side, “The impact of tariffs will be fading in 2026 in terms of change. There’s support coming from fiscal policy, interest rate cuts, lowering mortgage rates, and add in tailwinds from AI,” for productivity gains. He also said the bigger tax cuts will be going to higher income households, but with that, he sees wage growth and inflation falling back. “it’s the worst labor market in over a decade, layoffs remain low and that should continue this year,” said Pearce. “If you are employed you are still seeing wage gains and the risk of a layoff is relatively low. But young people of all ages are struggling in this slow labor market. If you are out of the labor market, it’s difficult to get back in.” On AI, Pearce said, “We are still in the relative early stages of this AI boom. The adoption rate across the economy continues to pick up. It’s mostly being financed out of earnings rather than using debt.” “What my father started 60 years ago was a brand based on his own philosophy of design — that products were created and designed with an idea of timelessness, things that get better with age,” said David Lauren, who focused on Ask Ralph, the virtual shopping and styling assistant on the Ralph Lauren app. Lauren, the son of Ralph Lauren and the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, said, “Technology has been the most incredible tool for us to take that philosophy and make it relevant for a new generation. The idea that clothes could be worn and passed down from generation to generation has to be shared with the new generation in a way that comes in their language.” Lauren said that Ralph Lauren was the first luxury fashion brand to sell on the internet. “No one had ever sold a $500 cashmere sweater online. No one had ever sold a suit online. We just thought this would be an interesting way to tell our story.” The company turned to Microsoft to bring the experience of the Ralph Lauren flagship on 72nd Street to the internet. Microsoft staffers spent three hours immersing themselves in the store to understand the culture, to create Ask Ralph. “Nobody needs a tie. Nobody needs a flannel shirt. Nobody needs another pair of jeans,” he said. But that can change when customers are “enveloped in the magic of Ralph Lauren. We feel that the technology helps us to fulfill that.” Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president, worldwide industry solutions for Microsoft, said that the Ask Ralph technology is “like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket advising you.” Lauren agreed, adding: “When a customer starts to feel confident about putting a look together, that’s a win.” Although the tool is only available for the Polo brand right now, Lauren said he expects it will be expanded to the company’s other offerings in the future. “As we expand it globally and bring our other brands to it, I think we’re going to get a much richer read on it.” In a “future proofing retail in 2028” session, Ashley Kechter, global president of athletic apparel brand Vuori, said “Integration between retail and digital is imperative” and stressed the importance of the customer experience. Vuori’s Regent Street store in London, which opened last year, is different from its L.A. store, Kechter said, because the company evaluates what’s right for the local customer and builds an experience unique to that store site. Dayna Quanbeck, president of shoe brand Rothy’s, stressed “the balance of both and how you build that model” of digital and physical stores is where the focus should be. Another focus for Rothy’s is on “testing and learning” to spot trends and determine “green shoots” for growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rothy’s launched bags and men’s shoes, but ultimately decided to keep its focus on innovating in women’s footwear. She said the company saw a huge opportunity in bags and men’s shoes, but it wasn’t the right time. For Rothy’s, the non-negotiable is sustainability — last fall the brand innovated a more sustainable way to manufacture velvet — while the biggest challenge is intellectual property. “We have a roster of patents that are often knocked off,” she said. Erin Chaney, senior vice president of e-commerce, Adidas NA, and Peter Larsen, vice president of multichannel commerce and fulfillment at Amazon, discussed their collaboration and how it’s setting new fulfillment standards for the footwear industry. “We’re getting faster every single year,” Larsen said of the marketplace platform’s delivery improvements. The collaboration with Adidas meant Amazon had to think differently about the supply chain because “Adidas has many products that turn over frequently,” Larsen said. Chaney said one challenge involved supply and how the two had to “synchronize” their respective inventory feeds. Some early marketplace orders saw cancellations because the German athletic brand wasn’t as fast on their end with inventory information and what was available for shipment. Once that was figured out, Adidas began seeing the revenue uplift it had expected and higher conversion rates. Chaney also said a pain point was callers to customer service asking where packages were and when they would be delivered. But with the collaboration, Amazon Prime-enabled deliveries are now within two to three days. The reduction of those service calls were a “big win” for Adidas, Chaney said. For LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, incorporating AI isn’t about removing the human touch in luxury — from handcrafted handbags and hand-sewn couture to white-glove customer service. It’s about heightening personal experiences and helping the company deliver on its “human values,” namely creativity and innovation, excellence and entrepreneurship. That message came from Gonzague de Pirey, chief omnichannel and data officer at LVMH, who said, “Human is a core value of luxury, and if we want to successfully develop technology, it needs to be everywhere, but visible nowhere.” He said the company calls this concept “quiet tech.” Many companies use AI as a means toward efficiency, but for LVMH, the goal was primarily business development and supporting the group’s values. After piloting and scaling a few use cases over the last couple years, LVMH embarked on a group-wide AI transformation plan. Recognizing that each of its more than 75 houses is unique, the conglomerate is enabling each business unit to develop its own plan that fits its DNA. Although brand specific, these strategies address a few common priorities: commerce, marketing and operations. Within Louis Vuitton, AI investments are focused on four key areas: enhancing creativity, reaching the right clients, elevating the customer experience and operational efficiencies, such as demand planning. “It’s a way to dream boldly, execute, invest on the topics and initiatives that really prove we can move the needle impacting our business and our client experience,” said Soumia Hadjali, Louis Vuitton’s global senior vice president, client development and digital. Using AI for creative purposes comes with risks, so LVMH is testing the combination of AI and creativity at some houses. For instance, at Louis Vuitton, AI is being used to help designers visualize materials and colors faster, providing more time to focus on craftsmanship and the narrative behind the products. AI is also being leveraged to generate e-commerce assets. In customer engagement, the use of AI is about “augmentation, not automation,” providing client advisers with consumer insights to support engagement, explained Hadjali. “AI really opened the capabilities, and the signature remains really human and distinctive,” she said. Louis Vuitton’s use of agentic commerce goes beyond the transactional. Hadjali described it as “orchestrating that entire ecosystem around one client,” creating a personalized experience and journey based on insights about the customer. With millions of clients, AI is about delivering experience and relevance at the right time, at scale. “It’s mainly about anticipating, understanding, integrating, responding to our clients’ intents, and building at the same time, trust, legitimacy,” she said. Two years into the future of AI at LVMH, de Pirey said a marker of success would be to involve everyone in the company with a culture very open to AI. “That would translate into, of course, greater business, greater market share, greater performance, greater financial performance. If we are able to, thanks to AI, increase the desire for our brands, that would be the absolute key for success.” Emma Grede, cofounder of the Good American and Skims brand, and Ben Francis, CEO and founder of Gymshark, outlined what made their companies successful and how agentic AI is part of it. Grede said that because customers are already exploring AI, it behooved her businesses to do the same. “We’re in the midst of a really seismic change,” she said. “To be where our customer is, we have no other choice than to be in it.” She views AI as a “second executive brain” that can take on tasks done by staffers. “We built these incredible businesses based on what the data is telling us, by being obsessed with our customer and obsessed with the product. But there’s a whole other side of what we do — market research and obsessing over the competition that, quite frankly, AI can do at a speed no human would ever find manageable. So for me, it’s not about taking anything human out of what we do, it’s actually leaving ourselves the time to do the stuff only we can do.” Francis said that when he founded Gymshark in 2012, it was strictly online. Gymshark has since opened stores, though digital still represents the bulk of the business. But his goal remains the same: “to build the greatest gym apparel brand in the world, in a market that is so saturated by sports, athleisure and fashion.” Although tempted, he’s resisted expanding the offering beyond his core product to boost sales, and it’s paid off. “We found that as we narrowed our product base, we’ve narrowed our focus…And the business has grown far more quickly than when we were trying to appeal to everyone,” he said. Gymshark has built a $1 billion business with just eight physical stores and a big online business. With brick-and-mortar, “It’s so easy to over-expand and alienate that core customer, but the second [you] do that, it’s very difficult to recover.” When Good American launched a decade ago, it offered product up to size 15, breaking the conventional rules of fashion. But because she was an “outsider,” Grede said she didn’t feel compelled to follow the rules. “You can no sooner launch a cosmetics brand with 10 shades of foundation than you can launch a clothing brand with this very narrow idea of what size people’s butts should be.” She followed the same playbook with Skims, which also paid dividends. “For me, it was just about taking out all of the preconceived notions…We’re not very referential. I think that’s our superpower. We don’t forecast trend, we create trend.” Stefani Fleurant, executive vice president of lifestyle marketing at Authentic Brands Group, said among the brand management and entertainment platform’s biggest hits have been Lucky Brand’s back-to-school campaign with Addison Rae, Aeropostale’s collaboration with Demetra Dias, and Reebok’s deal with WNBA star Angel Reece. These breakthrough consumer moments are part of Authentic’s mission to “acquire, protect and grow” its 50-plus brands through a “digital-first strategy.” Fleurant said the company early on worked with creatives to get its message out. But in recent years, consumers have gotten more selective. “Product has to earn its place,” she said. Creators have to “drive credibility,” she said, and help develop storytelling for each brand. Fleurant said Aeropostale actually brought Diaz on board as an intern last summer, where she co-created her collection with the company. When it dropped, Aeropostale skyrocketed to number three on the shopping section of the app store for that weekend. While JD Sports Fashion plc is an early adopter of agentic commerce evolution, it’s not losing sight of a fundamental point of retail: delivering on promises across channels. “As a retailer, the main goal is to serve your clients in the best way in every single place they want to be served,” said Olivier Nachba, deputy chief technology officer at JD Sports, in a conversation with Fluent Commerce’s chief strategy officer Nicola Kinsella. Around 20 percent of JD Group’s sales come from online channels; 80 percent is stores. Roughly 50 percent of its customer base is young, including teenagers who are early tech adopters. Nachba sees agentic commerce as another channel and opportunity for JD Sports to reach customers. Preparing for agentic commerce, JD Sports is getting its communications ready with generative engine optimization. Like search engine optimization before it, GEO is about sharing product data in a way that enables information to be gleaned by large language models such as ChatGPT or Gemini. Through GEO, JD Sports is gearing up for a global presence across every LLM. And to populate GEO, the company needs good data and content. “Our challenge is how we are going to be able to generate enough valid content targeted for our customer at scale level,” said Nachba. “We are leveraging a lot of AI to give superpower to our teams.” With agentic commerce, much like online searches linking to e-commerce sites, there is the risk that comes with being on the same platform as competitors. Nachba pointed to delivery as a competitive asset, and this is where order management systems come into play. “Order management system is a backbone of your operation (and) how you are going to serve your clients, and it’s a backbone of your delivery promise of your customer and your stock optimization,” said Nachba. “But what is really important is to understand how you are going to make people work around the order management system.” Without cross-organization alignment, Nachba explained a company’s brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce department could have competing priorities for order fulfillment, since they each want to move inventory out of their channel to protect their bottom lines. Order management systems like Fluent Commerce start with what the consumer wants to order and use rules — such as choosing the fulfillment method with the least emissions or the option that provides the best margins — to determine how to get the customer their desired product. The OMS also allows retailers to show customers expected delivery timelines. Given the significant portion of company sales that are via brick-and-mortar locations, Nachba said the in-store experience needs to provide the “best service.” This includes arming associates with training and tools so they can get product to the customer even if it is not in stock at that particular door. JD Group has linked up with CommerceTools and Stripe, becoming the first retailer to use their agentic commerce suite. This will enable it to sell on platforms like ChatGPT and Microsoft CoPilot in the U.S., a market that accounts for roughly 40 percent of the group’s $15 billion global business. “You need to have a clean house,” he said. “You can’t build something if the ground floor is not solid, so we are doing the job with all the team to have a structured data, an exposition of our data, the…source of truth of every single aspect of our business, to be sure that we will be able to leverage it.” Marco Benasedo, chief information officer at Boggi, the Milan menswear brand that hosted a breakfast at its store on Columbus Circle with tech partner Hekanize, cautioned that while Boggi is open to using AI, it is not at the expense of humans. He stressed that any action centered around creativity is still being performed by people since the human touch cannot be underestimated. By embracing technology, cumbersome tasks previously handled by headquarters and store staff can be reallocated, including inventory control and connecting frontline workers with back-office details needed to do jobs effectively. Brooklinen CEO Billy May and Steve Madden direct-to-consumer president Josh Krepon hammered down on today’s retail realities. Krepon acknowledged the impact AI is having on the world but he believes the retail industry will move a bit slower to adopt the technology. “I don’t have a lot of concern for jobs on the brand side,” Krepon said. “We’re still on the augment phase, and I do think AI will actually create new jobs over the next 10 to 20 years.” May concurred, saying, “If it’s a rote process that can certainly be automated, then that individual can move elsewhere in the company. Is there going to be mass layoffs? No. Will it be a redistribution of talent, 100 percent. And I think that organizations or functions that aren’t thinking about how to incorporate AI right now are the ones that are going to end up being most affected. The only way to predict the future is to be a part of it. You’ve got to be actively engaged and adopting and thinking about how to integrate AI into your organization, out of opportunity, as opposed to out of fear.” – With contributions from Sarah Jones, Vicki M.

Title: New World will join the graveyard of defunct MMOs when it goes offline in 2027

The MMO's last season will be extended until its final day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New World, the only Amazon game that stuck around long enough to find a steady amount of players, is now being ushered toward the graveyard with all the other games the ecommerce megacorp has shut down for good. And now we have the date for its final day: January 31, 2027. The game has now been delisted from Steam and every platform you could buy it on, and will only be playable by anyone who already owns it. Amazon says in a post about the news that the only way to refund the game is to contact the customer service of the platform you bought it on. There will be no refunds for Marks of Fortune, the MMO's premium currency. The MMO will remain playable for the next year until the servers shut down, but there won't be any future updates other than bug fixes and performance updates. While the game remains in stasis, its Nighthaven season will continue all the way until the end. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the post reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community." New World's end was preceded by a massive round of layoffs in October that slashed around 14,000 jobs at Amazon. It said they were part of "strategic changes" at the company and that it would halt "a significant amount" of first-party game development, particularly around MMOs. That same day, Amazon announced that it was "no longer sustainable to continue supporting [New World] with new content updates," and that its Nighthaven update would be its last. Developers on the game snuck a goodbye letter into the update, which was pointed out by one of the senior game designers after it dropped. It would be hard to call New World an explosive success, but it certainly wasn't a flop. Although the MMO never reached Final Fantasy 14 or World of Warcraft levels, it did bounce between 50,000 and 60,000 concurrent players on Steam after it was released. That's quite a lot for a newer MMO in an age where MMOs don't really catch on like it used to. Star Wars: The Old Republic hovers around 5,000 concurrent players on Steam, but whatever it's doing must be enough for EA to keep it around. I can only imagine Amazon had absurdly high expectations for it after watching it bring in more than a million players on release. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even though New World still has a year of life left, I will be curious to see if anyone manages to find a way to spin up private servers of it. Earlier this week, EA's live service shooter Anthem shut down, and its project lead suggested that there's a version of the game out there that could be turned into a private server if someone were to get their hands on it. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Tyler has covered videogames and PC hardware for 15 years.

Title: Amazon Puts the Nail in the Coffin: New World Aeternum Delisted Today, Will Go Offline January 2027

After Amazon killed New World Aeternum by cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly delisting the game as of today, January 15, 2026. Second, by announcing that the game will go offline on January 31, 2027. A blog post on the official New World website begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "provide transparency on where the game goes from here." Which, essentially, is nowhere. "New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page. New World: Aeternum will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027.Learn more: https://t.co/FK9O07Hm0F pic.twitter.com/UBXHaetLSz You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until July 20, 2026; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that refunds will not be available for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life. New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "significant" layoffs as part of Amazon's mass 14,000+ company-wide layoff last year. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising. It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up huge player numbers, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game. "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community." "It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."

Title: Fewer-than-expected number of Americans filed jobless claims last week, as layoffs remain low

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. READ MORE: Sluggish hiring closes out a frustrating year for job seekers Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren't yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as "low hire, low fire." READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here's what experts say they mean Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump's tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday's report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 3 declined by 19,000 to 1.88 million, the government said. Support trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

Title: How to Gain Footing in AI as the Ground Keeps Shifting
URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-developer-career-advice
Time Published: 2026-01-15T19:00:02Z
Full Content:
IEEE career guide offers tips on thriving amid ever-changing tech Willie Jones covers transportation for IEEE Spectrum and the history of technology for The Institute. The newly released Preparing for a Career as an AI Developer guide from the IEEE Computer Society argues that the most durable path to artificial intelligence jobs is not defined by mastering any single tool or model. Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills—capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace. AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze cybercrime, predict equipment failures in manufacturing, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to mass layoffs across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals. Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the banking, health care, retail, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making—and keep up with the competition. The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by San Murugesan and Rodica Neamtu. Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains. The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework. AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy. Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write. The guide cites surveys of executives about AI’s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by McKinsey & Co. The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants’ insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate. The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve. The strategic approach aligns with advice from Neil Thompson, director of FutureTech research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,” he says. “Applying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.” Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data, machine learning, and computing infrastructure. Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say. Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say. Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure is important, according to the guide’s authors. Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms. Python has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models. The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. PyTorch, developed by Meta AI, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. Scikit-learn provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. —Neil Thompson, MIT TensorFlow, a software library for machine learning and AI created by Google, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction. The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as résumé keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints. Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders. Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt. The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience. Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career. Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide. Each starting point reinforces the guide’s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance. Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process. “Always be curious,” he says. “Learn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.” Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one’s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend. In a field where today’s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide’s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.

Life is Strange: Double Exposure developer Deck Nine Games will reveal the next Life is Strange game next week on January 20, 2026, in a live stream that will kick off at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. The news was revealed in a short teaser video posted to the official Life is Strange X (formerly Twitter) account, which seems to tease the return of series protagonists Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, who walk across the frame in the teaser. Separate the real from the rumor... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game: https://t.co/29yzDsGCb5January 20. 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. pic.twitter.com/jYQphhU2e3 It's believed that the game revealed next week will be 'Life is Strange: Reunion,' a title that leaked from a PEGI ratings listing just last week. 2024's Double Exposure was the last game in the series, and one that carries its fair share of controversy with it among fans of the series. Not because it was an overall poor game - Wccftech gave it a 7.7/10 when we reviewed it when it launched - but because of the ways in which it impacts the storyline of the series, and how it makes players retcon the ending of the previous game right at the beginning. This next game could be a major turning point for the series and a major point for Deck Nine Games, which experienced two rounds of layoffs in 2024, the second coming after the release of Double Exposure. Hopefully, this new title will be a solution to Deck Nine's woes. We'll see how next week's reveal goes over with fans. In the meantime, if you're looking for more Life is Strange, Amazon has greenlit a TV series adaptation of the franchise led by Kaos writer Charlie Covell.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as U.S. layoffs remain low despite growing concern about a weakening job market. U.S. filings for jobless aid for the week ending Jan. 10 fell by 9,000 to 198,000, down from 207,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The figure was significantly less than the 215,000 that analysts polled by the data firm FactSet were expecting. Applications for unemployment benefits are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Last week, the government reported that hiring remained sluggish in December, capping a year of weak employment gains that have frustrated job seekers even though layoffs and unemployment remained low. Employers added just 50,000 jobs last month, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised figure of 56,000 in November, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4%, its first decline since June, from 4.5% in November, a figure also revised lower. Also last week, the Labor Department reported that businesses posted far fewer jobs in November than the previous month, a sign that employers aren’t yet ramping up hiring even as growth has picked up. Businesses and government agencies posted 7.1 million open jobs at the end of November, down from 7.4 million in October. Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.” Recent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. In an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell suggested that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring, when the Trump administration rolled out its sweeping import taxes. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon. Thursday’s report from the Labor Department also said that the four-week average of jobless claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, fell by 6,500 to 205,000. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 3 declined by 19,000 to 1.88 million, the government said. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.

Across Big Tech, companies are tightening worker oversight amid layoffs, AI-driven job anxiety, and cuts to entry-level roles. If 2025 was about bosses calling on workers to be hardcore, 2026 is about making sure they actually do it. A look inside two of the biggest players reveals what heightened accountability can look like: Business Insider exclusively reported this month that Amazon stepped up efforts to let managers track employee badge swipes and revised performance reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments. Meanwhile, Business Insider also learned that Meta is using dashboards to track workers' AI usage and simplifying its review structure with a winner-take-more approach that better rewards the highest performers. It is also cutting about 10% of workers at its metaverse division. Taken together, the moves signal that Big Tech is ratcheting up the stakes for workers who find themselves in a market that's sluggish for seemingly all but AI's shiniest superstars.

The ante-upping comes as companies are pumping massive sums into AI — and, in many cases, are still waiting for the returns to materialize. A desire to see more performance metrics may stem from a need to quantify how workers are using AI to boost productivity. "I suspect in a lot of tech firms, there is kind of a mood of panic," Matthew Bidwell, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, told Business Insider, referring to executives' fear of falling behind in the AI race. Bidwell added that the sense of urgency coming from the top around AI then leads to the question, "How do we make sure we're squeezing the most out of people?" Big Tech's answer? Go big on metrics. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. It's not just Amazon and Meta. Microsoft has worked to shed its "country club" reputation, while Google has also changed how it rates employees to incentivize outsize performance. Productivity dashboards, tool-usage metrics, and increasingly granular performance evaluations are becoming central to how managers gauge value. The goal, executives say, is to ensure accountability and reward top performers. The shift is also philosophical: Productivity isn't assumed. It has to be proven. At Amazon, managers have a dashboard to track how much time workers are spending at its corporate outposts — and to flag those who are brushing off the company's return-to-office mandate. The company, as part of its performance review process, is asking its corporate workers to provide three to five accomplishments that exemplify their work. Meta is also adjusting how it keeps score of workers' performance — in part by giving more frequent feedback and tightening the focus on "rewarding outstanding performance," a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider earlier this month. The demand for greater productivity isn't limited to tech. Citi CEO Jane Fraser sent a memo to the bank's staff on Wednesday, entitled "The bar is raised," in which she made it clear to Citi's more than 200,000 workers that she expects them to raise their standards in 2026. "We are not graded on effort. We are judged on our results," Fraser wrote in the memo. The power moves from Big Tech likely reflect a mix of factors, industry observers said. There is the expectation that AI will supercharge workers; yet, there is also a view that something has to justify the massive outlays on the technology. Spending on AI tools that help programmers write code, for example, can bring with it the expectation from management that workers become faster and more efficient. At Incedo, an enterprise AI and data firm, coding assistants have helped boost workers' productivity between 25% and 40%, Nitin Seth, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider. "As that is happening, there is a squeeze on jobs," he said. Across tech, Seth said, that can mean an imperative to produce more or cut jobs — or both. Incedo has reduced workers because of AI's productivity windfall, he said, though the company continues to hire data engineers among other roles. The company didn't specify how many roles it has cut. Even so, Seth said, AI's productivity bounce in the tech industry hasn't been as great so far as some bosses and boards would like. He said that by the final months of 2025, many business leaders experienced the "sobering realization" that while the early gains from AI were impressive, carving out further wins had proven difficult. Seth likens the AI environment to that of roads and cars — where AI infrastructure is the road and an AI use case is the car. Companies have been spending big on the roads, Seth said, but as yet, "there aren't too many cars." There's also a sunnier take: Leaders feel compelled to "better justify" the people they employ in order to protect their jobs, said Christopher Myers, the faculty director of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. The idea, he told Business Insider, is that dashboards make it clear what workers are doing. It's a way of competing with the readily available metrics on what AI is churning through. One clear fallout is that employers will be able to save money by pushing out low performers, Myers said. RTO mandates, he said, can also be a way of letting go of workers unwilling to comply. Whatever's behind it, he said, leaders' thinking appears to be, "I'm really going to grade hard." It's likely that investors are worried about the number of workers at some companies, said Wharton's Bidwell. Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter — and the company's ability to carry on even after deep staff cuts — some investors have concluded that tech firms' pandemic-era bloat could be eliminated, Bidwell said. "He came in. He fired everybody. It didn't fall over," he said of Musk. That has led to what Bidwell sees as "a big cultural shift" in tech about the need to hire the best and the brightest — if only to keep them from going to competitors. The shift means that leaders in Silicon Valley are asking tougher questions about who is pulling their weight. That pressure, Incedo's Seth said, then falls on managers and, ultimately, down to rank-and-file tech workers who are seeing increased performance expectations. "There is greater pressure, greater anxiety, and it's kind of like a snowball effect," he said. Do you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The great middle manager flattening is in full swing, and those who remain are seeing their dominions balloon. It's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout. Managers' average number of reports — their "span of control" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9. Are you a manager with 25 or more direct reports, or have been asked to take on more reports in the "Great Flattening?" Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com. That's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview. "I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account," Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.

In recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy. "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership." Flattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities. In 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout. "Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues," Lee-Hawkins said. "We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development." What's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size. "When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached," Harter said. "We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better." Tanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more "thoughtful" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience. "If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people," Deora said. Gallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role. "What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status," Harter said. "I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective."

Title: Meta is changing its performance review to reward output over effort, taking a page from Amazon and X

Meta Platforms Inc. just became the latest tech company to rejig its performance review process to hone in on an employee’s output, as opposed to effort. The company is rolling out a new performance review platform called Checkpoint, which will grade workers, grouping them into four categories and rewarding top performers for exceptional work, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider. “We’re evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,” a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. “While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.” The memo outlined the predicted distribution of outcomes and pay multipliers for base bonuses. About 20% of employees will be labeled “Outstanding” and will be eligible for a bonus double their pay; 70% will be labeled “Excellent” with a 115% pay bonus; around 7% will fall into the “Needs Improvement” category, eligible for a bonus up to 50% of pay. Around 3% of employees may be labeled “Not Meeting Expectations” and will be ineligible for a bonus. On the other hand, the system will reward top performers with bonuses worth up to 300%. The performance review update comes as other Big Tech companies have overhauled their performance review systems to better reflect employee performance. Amazon’s new review system asks corporate workers to list three to five accomplishments that reflect their best work. And in 2022, Elon Musk asked X (formerly Twitter) employees to explain what they accomplished every week. Meta is planning a company-wide meeting Jan. 22 to further explain the changes to employees. The new changes will impact the 2026 performance cycle and will not change the current review cycle. The new system will entail two review cycles per year, using the same rating system each cycle. As part of this new review timeline, bonuses will be paid out twice annually. Tech companies have increasingly sought concrete examples of output as proof of productivity, requiring that employees demonstrate how well they perform. While outcomes have been a longstanding cornerstone of corporate performance reviews, the new push toward output-based assessments reflects a growing desire among tech leaders to incentivize employees to prove outstanding performance. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has pushed to reduce management layers and to eliminate bureaucracy since taking over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2022 that he was aiming to make the company more lean to promote “product excellence and productivity.” That has been the trend at Meta, where the tech company called 2023 the “year of efficiency” as the company scaled back headcount. In 2022, the company laid off about 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees. And last year, the company cut 5% of its workforce, or roughly 3,000 workers, targeting low performers. To be sure, an update to Meta’s performance review system is not a warning sign that additional layoffs are on their way. But Meta is set to announce layoffs this week in the company’s Reality Labs business, according to reporting by The New York Times, as the company scales back its metaverse unit. “We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ahead of last year’s cuts. “But now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.”

Title: Meta Reportedly Laying Off More Than 10% Of Reality Labs

Meta is laying off around 10% of its Reality Labs division, specifically targeting VR and Horizon Worlds, The New York Times reports. Reality Labs, if you're unaware, is the division of Meta behind its Quest headsets, Horizon software, smart glasses, and sEMG wristband, as well as researching future technologies such as Codec Avatars and true AR glasses. The New York Times estimates Reality Labs at roughly 15,000 staff, suggesting that more than 1500 could be losing their job. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has scheduled an all-hands meeting for tomorrow, both the NYT and Business Insider claim, describing it as the “most important” of the year. The report comes just over a month after Meta officially confirmed "shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables", a statement which itself followed early reports of the cuts from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Insider. "Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and Wearables given the momentum there," last month's statement read. "We aren't planning any broader changes than that." With the layoffs reportedly taking place this week, we'll bring you updates as we learn of Meta staff affected. Meta's funding shift from Horizon Worlds and VR to smart glasses is happening just over a year after a leaked memo from Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told Reality Labs staff that 2025 will determine whether their projects are "the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure". In the memo, Bosworth described 2025 as "the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs", and told staff they "need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR". Note that at the time, Meta was using MR to refer to VR too, a nomenclature that it ended earlier this year. "And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance", Bosworth followed that sentence with. Since then, Reality Labs saw its highest-ever quarterly revenue in Q4 2024 with the launch of Quest 3S, which was the top-selling console on Amazon US for Christmas. But this momentum did not carry through into 2025 at all. The first two quarters of 2025 saw Quest sales decline year-over-year, revealing that while Quest 3S was a popular stocking stuffer, it simply is not a successful year-round product. While Q3 saw a rebound, Meta explained that this was due to retailers stocking up on Quest 3S for this year's holiday season. Meanwhile, Meta has continued to push its Horizon Worlds "metaverse" platform with multi-million-dollar creator competitions, especially focused on smartphone-only worlds, as the company hopes to scale the platform from a social VR space to a cross-platform Roblox and Fortnite competitor. This relative stagnation in Meta's Quest and Horizon Worlds effort is contrasted with skyrocketing sales and significant public and investor interest in its smart glasses. In multiple earnings calls last year, Meta's partner EssilorLuxottica said that the Ray-Ban Meta glasses were performing "exceptionally well", with sales having more than tripled compared to 2024. Both companies have claimed to be selling many models as fast as they can make them. Meta has also claimed "unprecedented demand" for its higher-end Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, recently announcing a delay of its international expansion plans to catch up with US production. UPDATE: UploadVR can confirm that the layoffs include the closure of Twisted Pixel Games (Deadpool VR), Sanzaru Games (Asgard's Wrath), and Armature Studio (Resident Evil 4 VR). UPDATE 2: Meta announced that its VR/MR fitness service Supernatural will no longer receive any "new content or feature updates". Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: 9 marketing predictions for 2026 as AI fuels polarity

Let Marketing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The sense of a stable middle ground is eroding across an industry at a point of contraction, with many displaying mixed feelings about marketing’s future. The sense of a stable middle ground will continue to erode across several aspects of marketing in 2026. Studies indicate the middle class is thinning, altering important consumer milestones. Monoculture is also on the wane as people spend more time engaged with algorithms hypertailored to their interests. On the industry front, marketing services are gravitating toward two polarities in the wake of historic consolidation: White-glove models and plug-and-play ones built around artificial intelligence. Feeling some of the most pain from these developments are the employees who make the industry hum but are facing a grim job market. “There has been a rampant uptick in the past few years of putting the focus on shareholder value,” said Dustin Black, executive creative director at Preston Spire. “Culturally, the difference between decision-makers and makers has never been greater.” The advancement of generative AI could encourage mediocrity — “slop” was deemed a 2025 word of the year for a reason — but also benefit marketers moving against the grain. To grab attention, brands may embrace messaging that is deliberately button-pushing or bold. “A lot of the output is trending toward the median,” said Taryn Crouthers, CEO of Spcshp, about AI in marketing. “It’s about pulling against the median because all of the content is merging to look very, very similar.” Others could step up investment in emergent channels to reach audiences with growing economic influence, including Gen Alpha. There will be no shortage of stages to test these tactics, with a Super Bowl, Olympics and FIFA World Cup on deck. Below, Marketing Dive shares nine predictions for an industry at a point of contraction and displaying mixed feelings about its future. Omnicom’s acquisition of Interpublic Group signals more agency consolidation coming down the pike, experts say. As rumors swirl around additional breakups and sell-offs, a new chapter is on the horizon for ad-holding groups. “It’s absolutely signifying a shift towards media and technology scale as key foundational elements for what the legacy holding companies will reorganize around,” said Jay Pattisall, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, of the Omnicom-IPG deal. Dealmaking activity could be enabled by further interest rate cuts and a light-touch regulatory environment. Other agencies may broker richer strategic partnerships: For example, Publicis kicked off 2026 by striking a pact with LiveRamp, underpinning the significance of data in the AI arms race, Ad Age reported. Massive layoffs and the death of iconic creative shops — not to mention the likelihood of future cost-cutting measures — have been painful but also mean that an army of talent is seeking its next venture. “You might see a lot of these former executives trying to start their own firms playing to the more niche side of the marketplace,” said Paul Hardart, a clinical professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Independents meanwhile may pursue different routes to expansion. ZMC-backed Wpromote’s purchase of Giant Spoon in late 2025 speaks to the role private equity is playing in the formation of “big indies” that could appeal to deep-pocketed brands. “Not tomorrow, not next month, but in the not-so-distant future, there are going to be more options for enterprise marketers to choose from as a result of the private-equity investments in what we historically call independent digital agencies,” said Pattisall. Brands will further push the limits of AI-generated creative in 2026, with football’s big night acting as a key litmus test. Svedka already announced it will run a Super Bowl spot made with AI, but the spirits maker won’t be the only advertiser putting on an AI showcase. “I would say, more likely than not, 50% of all Super Bowl spots we watch this year will utilize generative AI in some facet,” said Chris Neff, chief AI officer at Anomaly, noting that those applications could be in pre-production and not immediately apparent on screen. While the AI content spigot is flowing, marketers will explore different messaging avenues. Brands, including Equinox and Dollar Shave Club, have recently launched campaigns that prod at the backlash to AI slop while still leveraging generative AI tools. However, many continue to underestimate strong consumer aversion. “Rushing into anything — over doing things to that extent — is a mistake,” said Sean Cassidy, CEO of PR firm DKC. “One thing that humans seem to still possess...is a pretty good B.S. detector.” Trepidation around AI extends into other areas, even as the technology becomes institutionalized at brands and agencies. Artificially inflated engagement may create a negative feedback loop for advertisers that are only investing more in social and digital, contributing to the Dead Internet Theory. “The bot traffic is going to increase. Is that going to make the metrics even better? Is that going to be the catalyst for this vicious cycle for it to get worse and worse and worse?” said Neff. “It's very hard to know exactly what’s real and not.” “[Brands are] playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” Bill Bruno CEO of Celebrus Advertisers, agencies and other stakeholders have spent years shoring up their land grabs in the data-driven marketing ecosystem to fuel developments like programmatic advertising and help gird against the shift from identifiers like third-party cookies. That rush for data will continue to intensify amid the rise and operationalization of AI-driven advertising, giving marketers a chance to learn and apply the lessons of previous eras. Data transparency and ownership will be key as AI complicates challenges that marketers already face around ad visibility and efficacy, especially amid the rise of zero-click search and AI-powered bots and agents that could muddy measurement waters. “You've got a lot of brands… that are basically using terms like ‘AI readiness’ that don't know what they need or what they're going to do, necessarily,” explained Bill Bruno, CEO of data firm Celebrus. “I don't think a lot of people are thinking two or three steps ahead right now. They're playing checkers, and data companies are playing chess.” To have a better handle on data, marketers can shift focus from collecting data to connecting it via tools like consumer data platforms and data fabric environments that give a more unified view of consumers, several experts said. That can help marketers focus on exactly what they need, rather than getting washed away in a flood of data. “My clients who have been most successful are focusing on marketing-specific use-case data readiness,” said Nicole Greene, vice president, analyst at Gartner. “Do we really know what our customers want? Can we safeguard the data that they have entrusted us with, and as a result, can we do marketing and advertising better?” "I don’t think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women... It’s more being true to what the company and what the audience is." Adam Singer Vice president of marketing at AdQuick Some of last year’s boldest advertising featured good jeans, spicy plumbers, the best car to have sex in and a full bush summer. Similarly edgy ad creative could return to the fore as marketers look to break through in an increasingly fragmented and frantic media landscape. While those campaigns relied on — and often parodied — “sex sells” tropes, their success speaks more to their ability to break through an ad landscape that has grown increasingly stale and bland, even before the rise of AI, said Adam Singer, vice president of marketing at AdQuick. “Companies have become really risk averse. I think consumers are really thirsty for brands to do things that are interesting,” Singer said. However, being bold doesn’t mean that brands must turn back the clock and revive aesthetics and attitudes that have largely fallen by the cultural wayside. “I don't think being more authentic necessarily has to mean scantily clad women or even necessarily really attractive celebrities, although celebrities definitely push product,” Singer said. “It's more being true to what the company and what the audience is.” Marketers can bring this type of authenticity to life in several ways, from emotional messages to simply portraying their products with beautiful photography and videography — as long as the company is authentic to its core values. Last year’s Cracker Barrel rebrand fiasco is an example of what not to do. “Everyone tried to make that a political thing and say it was ‘woke,’ but I don't think that's really what was going on,” Singer said. “We've seen companies flattening everything, making everything a little bit more boring, and people are tired of that. They want brands to do big, bold things.” Marketers should prepare for further consolidation in an ad-tech industry that has reached maturity but continues to evolve alongside technological change. “At different areas in the ecosystem, there is a consolidation of the media activation between DSPs and SSPs — most of them are starting to compete with each other and not just partner with each other anymore,” said Mathieu Roche, CEO of identity firm ID5. In the DSP space, Amazon and Walmart continue to develop their offerings, while Microsoft’s sunsetting of Xandr provided a boost to Amazon via a transition partnership. Some brands have looked to test different sell-side workflows, including marketplace deals and guaranteed programmatic buys, especially as more connected TV inventory comes on board, said LiveRamp’s Travis Clinger. Consolidation could benefit brands and publishers as it reduces fees and the costs of operating, but the reduction of consumer choice has caused the space to face antitrust issues. Google is expected to learn the fate of its ad-tech antitrust case this year, and while it appears that it will not face more dramatic structural remedies, any decision could cause a surge in ad-tech M&A, explained Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Forrester. “Google's competitors aren't going to let an opportunity pass them by to take advantage of any weakening of Google's position in the ad tech market,” Mitchell-Wolf said. “I do anticipate the rest of the ad tech market trying to shore up their offerings, just to prepare and posture themselves to have the maximally enticing place to land for any advertisers or publishers that take a look at what Google is offering on the tail end of this.” Though the oldest members of Gen Alpha will be turning only 16 in 2026, the generation is already making waves. The cohort already wields $28 billion in direct spending power, and its influence can be seen within the marketing strategies of brands ranging from Lowe’s to Hi-Chew. In 2026, advertiser interest in Gen Alpha, or those born between 2010 and 2024, will become more concrete, according to GWI Chief Operating Officer Misha Williams. “Thinking about [Gen Alpha] in terms of an afterthought or a demographic not to be considered when you are shaping your brand positioning … is a mistake,” said Williams. While the older end of Gen Alpha is beginning to make purchases for themselves, the cohort holds significant sway over purchases made by their parents and has already established awareness for hundreds of brands. The group is also being raised in the age of social media algorithms and AI, priming them to expect deeper personalization from brands compared to previous generations, Williams explained. “With access to information, people become more aware of what they like, what they don’t like,” Williams said. “So when you’re talking about Gen Alpha and the fact that they’re so young, a critical mistake is to treat them as such.” Brands targeting Gen Alpha should expect media consumption behavior that’s even more fragmented than their Gen Z predecessors, Williams said. The cohort is also more inclined to lean on their social connections to validate whether or not a brand or product aligns with their lifestyle, making it critical for marketers to find an authentic value proposition. “What you’re putting in front of them, from an advertising and marketing perspective, must be authentic,” Williams said. “It has to resonate with them contextually.” "It’s not like marketing was ever an easy job. It just became even more difficult." Dipanjan Chatterjee Vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Social media and creator-led marketing surged in 2025 as giants like PepsiCo and Unilever evolved how they work with agencies and dramatically boosted their investments, a signal of the growing role both channels play in shaping culture. Interest is expected to grow in 2026, with creator ad spend in the U.S. forecast to climb 18% year over year, per the IAB. The bet is a signal that marketers have begun to value community over reach, according to Movers+Shakers Chief Creative Officer Geoffrey Goldberg. Brands will likely direct much of their budgets to smaller creators this year, Goldberg forecasts, noting that AI could help streamline the process by helping marketers scale content volume and better understand target audiences. However, category interest is bound to emphasize growing pains. For example, a rise in AI content on social feeds will likely pressure creators to strengthen their creative muscles to cut through the noise. “Already, the amplification of content and the different styles of content has upped so much because of AI … there’s a lot more people in the playing field,” Goldberg said. “The algorithms are still prioritizing great content, it’s prioritizing that over followers.” A surge in content could see both social media teams and consumers faced with burnout as more brands opt for always-on strategies. Broadly, as social media becomes a more foundational aspect of marketers’ playbooks, concerns around a lack of measurement standardization will only grow, a challenge Goldberg recommends brands approach by prioritizing metrics that prove engagement. “In order for [social] to really be their operating system, we need to be really clear on how we measure success and there’s no singular, clear metric,” Goldberg said. Sports marketing will be a major avenue for marketers looking to reach consumers in an increasingly fractured advertising landscape in 2026. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2026 Winter Olympic Games will deliver captive linear TV audiences while emerging sports and leagues create avenues for marketers to connect with more niche, but growing, consumer groups. “One of the things we're seeing is a really incredible momentum behind a lot of small, micro leagues from a familiarity perspective. They’re not super well known yet, but of the people who are aware of them, they have just incredible momentum. They're personally relevant, culturally relevant. They're really sort of poised to take off,” said Jennifer Musil, global president of research at The Harris Poll. Women’s sports will continue to gain momentum in 2026, especially as more niche sports and leagues become more popular. For example, upstart women’s basketball league Unrivaled signed Maker’s Mark, a Beam Suntory Brand, as its first-ever official spirits partner in December. Women’s sports leagues give small and large brands alike an opportunity to get in early as audiences continue to grow. “Seven of the top 10 leagues in the last data set we looked at from a momentum perspective, are female leagues. So women's sports still has a ton of momentum behind it. It's not done growing yet,” said Musil. Tariffs chaos and confusion will not be left behind in 2025, but will continue to cause issues for marketers and consumers alike in 2026. Economic concerns, such as increased cost of living and inflation, may only exacerbate the issue. While the advertising industry has remained remarkably resilient in the face of tariffs and global ad revenue is expected to climb 8.8% in 2026, the Trump administration’s approach to international trade is expected to still create stress for adland. The on-and-off-again nature of tariffs and the steady rise in prices of imported goods makes it difficult for consumers to create and stick to a budget, which may translate to less discretionary spending. “CMOs are marketing to the end consumer. What is going on with tariffs is exceptionally chaotic because it makes it impossible for consumers to be able to plan their own budgets…because there is complete turbulence as it relates to tariffs," said Mike Proulx, vice president, research director, Forrester. Ultimately, marketers will have to adapt their strategies to better handle uncertainty. This could mean shorter campaigns and quicker turnaround times and an increased focus on value. As consumers tighten their purse strings, putting an emphasis on value and deals could help mitigate some of the chaos of the current economic landscape. This was already a major focus for advertisers in 2025 and could continue to be a viable strategy for 2026. “Over the last couple of years, marketers have gotten used to planning in an environment of considerable volatility. In reality, you can't plan for anything, yet you have to plan,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president, principal analyst, Forrester. “It's not like marketing was ever an easy job.

Title: Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donates $45 million to LGBTQ+ youth hotline organization, The Trevor Project

The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott’s gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit’s board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project’s 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it’s not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations’ business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said. He said research is also unclear whether diversifying an organization’s revenue streams is always a better financial strategy. “You’re less dependent upon a few funders, but on the other hand, if you have a lot of different revenue streams, do you have the management capacity for that?” Calabrese asked, speaking generally and not commenting specifically on The Trevor Project. Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications. Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track. But what if these imagined liabilities are actually assets? … What if the fact that some of our organizations are vulnerable can itself be a powerful engine for our generosity?” Black called Scott’s second gift “a powerful validation,” of The Trevor Project’s mission and impact, saying, “We’re calling this our turnaround story.” ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said.

The nonprofit Trevor Project received a $45 million gift from billionaire MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025 The Trevor Project, known for its hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, received $45 million from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott at the end of 2025, the organization said Monday. The gift is the largest in the organization's history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott's gift. Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020. In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said. The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit's board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million. “We are a smaller organization than we were before,” Black said. “And we will continue to be really intentional and really mindful around growth and what growth really means for the organization.” After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period. “MacKenzie Scott’s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,” Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds. Thad Calabrese, a professor at New York University who researches nonprofit financial management, said it's not at all uncommon for nonprofits that grow very quickly to run into financial problems. But he also said the cuts and general instability in especially federal funding for nonprofits has upended many organizations' business models. “Academic research has often viewed public funding as very stable, as a signal to donors that you’ve arrived as an organization, but the reality is you are now also open to changing political fortunes,” he said.

The gift is the largest in the organization’s history but also a major boon following years of management turmoil, layoffs and the loss of significant federal funding over the summer. “I literally could not believe it and it took some time.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the 988 service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025. Since the program’s end, The Trevor Project’s hotline has become even more central to mental health support for queer young people, said Scott Bertani, director of advocacy at the National Coalition for LGBTQ Health. “Their services fill a gap that generic crisis lines simply aren’t designed to meet, particularly for young people facing identity-based stress, isolation or rejection,” Bertani said in a statement. The Trevor Project has faced internal turmoil after its budget grew from around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns.

Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization’s annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott’s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. Elisha Smith Arrillaga, vice president of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said that’s likely because of the vigorous vetting that Scott’s team, the members of which are largely unknown, does before making gifts. She also said just like an investor might double down on a for-profit startup that’s struggling, some funders may still believe in an organization’s potential despite setbacks. “People make all different kinds of investments because they really believe in the outcomes that organization can make and what their gifts can do to help accelerate that,” Smith Arrillaga said. In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, “The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track.

Title: Media buyers say Yahoo’s DSP is one to watch

Keep up to date with Digiday’s annual coverage of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. More from the series → After Yahoo was sold by Verizon Wireless to Apollo Global, many deemed it a trade-down, with exits to private equity often interpreted as a last shot at relevance. Since that 2021 deal, it has undergone a reputational turnaround among parts of the advertising industry, even if the aggressive advance of another challenger has blunted its momentum. Most recently, Yahoo’s demand-side platform has become a source of genuine curiosity — and in some cases cautious enthusiasm — among media buyers. Conversations with senior agency leaders point to tangible product progress: a clearer AI roadmap, an expanding commerce media footprint, and a more coherent identity spine. That momentum was underscored during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, when Yahoo confirmed earlier reports that it was updating its buying platform with agentic AI capabilities, following months of industry speculation around AI-driven workflow changes inside DSPs. Yet recent developments, including a fresh round of layoffs — the depth of which Yahoo declined to detail — reinforce a broader truth: even with renewed interest, Yahoo remains firmly in challenger territory. That challenge is sharpened by Amazon’s DSP, which continues to grow at a pace buyers describe as difficult for the rest of the field to match, particularly as it pushes further into premium video, commerce media, and full-funnel measurement — a strategy Digiday has previously detailed in its coverage of how Amazon is reshaping the DSP category. This leaves Yahoo in a nuanced middle position: materially improved, increasingly well regarded by sophisticated traders, and generating real buzz — but operating in a market increasingly defined by platform scale. Sources close to the company describe the past year as a “technical reset” for Yahoo DSP. At CES, Yahoo confirmed the platform has undergone a multi-phase rebuild designed to reposition it as an AI-native buying environment, moving beyond legacy automation toward an agentic model. Under this approach, AI systems assist with planning, optimize bidding and pacing, surface cross-channel opportunities, automate elements of measurement, and reduce executional friction for traders. Rather than black-box automation, the emphasis is on embedding always-on intelligence across the workflow — echoing broader buyer demands for explainability Digiday has reported on in AI-driven media buying. Central to that shift is what Yahoo calls a “Yours, Mine, and Ours” framework, which it announced on Jan. 6 at CES. Advertisers can deploy their own AI agents, rely on Yahoo’s native agents, or connect the two through APIs and Model Context Protocols. The intent is to allow external models to participate directly in activation, troubleshooting, and audience discovery within governed data boundaries — a more open stance than rivals that tightly control AI extensibility. At launch, Yahoo said agentic capabilities already live include AI-assisted campaign activation, proactive troubleshooting for pacing and delivery issues, and audience exploration via programmatic access to Yahoo DSP metadata. More advanced optimization, QA, and measurement agents are expected through 2026. Multiple sources describe the DSP as central to Yahoo’s long-term strategy, even as speculation around a potential sale persists. Internally, it is viewed as a growth engine and the focal point of broader tech modernization — a theme consistent with Digiday’s prior reporting on private-equity-owned media companies refocusing on ad tech. Recent evolution includes a year-long infrastructure overhaul, a widened push toward mid-market advertisers, new commerce media partnerships, and the formal unveiling of its agentic roadmap at CES. Commerce media has emerged as one of Yahoo DSP’s more unexpected strengths. Buyers say its ability to blend retail data with ConnectID, extend into categories where Amazon is less dominant, and layer commerce signals across Yahoo-owned properties gives it a differentiated role — particularly as the category accelerates, as Digiday has outlined in its coverage of commerce media’s expansion beyond retail giants. Several senior agency executives say the platform has materially improved across UI, workflow, identity resolution, and support. Crucially, it has retained advanced trader controls at a time when rivals are abstracting them away — a dynamic Digiday has previously examined in relation to The Trade Desk and DV360 tightening control. Despite improved sentiment, challenges remain. Demand diversification has thinned following multiple rounds of layoffs, with the DSP team taking disproportionate hits, according to sources. Yahoo declined to comment. Yahoo DSP enters 2026 as a technically stronger, AI-forward, commerce-media-capable alternative at a moment when buyers are hungry for options. But the market is consolidating rapidly around Amazon, Google, and The Trade Desk. The question is whether improved tooling and agentic ambition are enough in a category increasingly defined by scale. The preliminary findings order billions in damage payments and reserve the right to force a sell-off, echoing regulators across the globe. The report acknowledges that the practice of principal media will only grow, but it offers ways to increase transparency around the opaque process. Technology is seen by indies as a potential great equalizer when it comes to delivering solutions for clients, and competing with bigger agencies.

Title: Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service | TechCrunch

The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.” Topics Transportation Editor Plan ahead for the 2026 StrictlyVC events.
