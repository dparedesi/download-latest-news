December 19, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While much of the public narrative around the technology sector has focused on layoffs and workforce reductions, industry analysts point to a parallel and more consequential shift unfolding beneath the headlines. One organization addressing the growing gap between AI talent demand and available expertise is Interview Kickstart, whose Advanced Machine Learning Course is designed to help professionals build production-ready AI skills aligned with hiring expectations at large technology companies. Major technology companies are concentrating resources around artificial intelligence engineering at an unprecedented scale, signaling a structural transformation in how technical talent is hired, organized, and valued across the industry. The multi-month program spans core programming fundamentals through advanced machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and deployment practices, with instruction led by engineers from FAANG and other Tier-1 firms. More information about the course is available at https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course#interview-preparation. Public workforce data and industry research indicate that AI engineering teams at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Meta have expanded significantly over the past several years, even as broader headcount reductions occurred elsewhere. By late 2024, these firms collectively employed tens of thousands of engineers in roles dedicated to machine learning, generative AI, data infrastructure, and applied AI systems. Analysts note that this concentration of AI expertise has few historical precedents in the technology sector. This expansion reflects deliberate strategic repositioning rather than reactive hiring. In the years leading up to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools, large technology firms increased investment in AI talent, computing infrastructure, and internal research capacity. Hiring trends from 2019 through 2024 show sustained growth in specialized AI roles, suggesting that companies were anticipating changes in how products and services would be built and delivered. Notably, this hiring momentum continued even during periods of broader workforce contraction. While companies reduced staffing in areas such as marketing, operations, and general administration, AI engineering teams were largely protected and, in some cases, expanded. Industry observers interpret this as a clear signal that AI-related roles are viewed as central to long-term competitiveness rather than discretionary investments. The resulting labor market has become increasingly segmented. Professionals with experience building and deploying AI systems at scale are in high demand, while roles centered on routine implementation or narrowly scoped tasks face growing automation pressure. Recruiters report that AI engineering positions often require experience beyond theoretical knowledge, including hands-on work with large language models, data pipelines, distributed systems, and production deployment. This demand has outpaced supply. Despite sustained hiring efforts, many organizations report difficulty filling AI engineering roles due to a shortage of candidates with relevant, production-level experience. As a result, qualified professionals are often able to choose among multiple opportunities, particularly at organizations with significant AI infrastructure and research investments. However, industry analysts emphasize that access to these roles depends on depth of expertise. Companies are not simply seeking familiarity with AI concepts; they are evaluating candidates on their ability to design, implement, and maintain complex systems under real-world constraints. This includes considerations such as scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and responsible deployment. The distinction between conceptual understanding and applied expertise has become increasingly important. Professionals who have built and operated AI systems in production environments are better positioned to meet hiring criteria than those whose exposure is limited to coursework or isolated experiments. This has led many engineers and data professionals to pursue structured upskilling as a way to bridge the gap. Interview Kickstart's Advanced Machine Learning Course is structured around this industry reality. The program emphasizes applied learning through live instruction, hands-on projects, and capstone work modeled on real business scenarios across sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare, cybersecurity, and financial technology. According to the company, the curriculum is regularly updated to reflect emerging requirements, including agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, scalable model deployment, and machine learning operations. In addition to technical training, the program integrates interview preparation and career coaching. Participants engage in mock interviews with instructors who have experience hiring for AI and ML roles, along with resume and behavioral coaching designed to reflect evaluation standards at large technology firms. This combination aims to align skill development with real-world hiring processes. Industry observers note that as AI adoption accelerates, the need for professionals who can translate AI capabilities into reliable products and systems will continue to grow. Structured programs that combine technical depth with practical application may play an increasingly important role in preparing professionals for this evolving landscape.

Title: New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-lottery-new-rules-salary-big-tech-students-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:22:01Z
Full Content:
The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 85,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in. This fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out. The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments on the rule and preparing the final text. Three months after President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B workers, Business Insider has assessed what's changed, who is benefiting, and who is getting hurt. Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one. Suddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company. The Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been "deliberately exploited" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts. In a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to "root out fraud." "The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended," Tragesser said. Meanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules. A State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis. Immigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies. The fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots. Large enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms. Justin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success. The wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery. "Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission," said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups "may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system." One exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high. Under the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal. New grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all. Alcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules. On paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said. The Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent. The tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding. Immigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance. Domestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches. "One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing," said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. "Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday." Correction: December 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of H-1B visas approved annually. The cap is 85,000 visas. Jump to

Title: How Amazon's 8.5% layoff in Luxembourg raises difficult questions for Indian foreign workers

Time Published: 2025-12-19T02:35:18Z

When Amazon announced 14,000 cuts globally earlier this week, a number of these were from its tech unit in Luxembourg. Bloomberg reported that the retail giant is culling 8.5% or 370 of its 4,370 employees in the tiny European nation, its largest such job cuts here in around 20 years. The Amazon layoffs could also pose an impossible situation for Indian and other foreign workers in Luxembourg, who are likely to be among those affected. The redundancies are “adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies,” Amazon said in a memo to staff on 12 December, adding that the severance package “goes well beyond industry benchmarks”. The Luxembourg Labor Minister’s office didn’t return a request for comment on the layoffs. The Duchy of Luxembourg has employees from the United States, Australia, Egypt, India, and Tunisia working at Amazon. If any of these staff are among those fired, they will have to find another job within three months or return home. Speaking to Bloomberg, Prash Chandrasekhar, a member of the Amazon employee delegation, said some employees may have to leave the country. “I am almost sure some employees will have to leave. It’s not easy to find a job in Luxembourg, for 370 people entering the job market at the same time,” he said. Chandrasekhar added that for those seeking work in big tech in particular, there is no real alternative to Amazon. Notably, to fire employees in the European Union (EU), companies must hold negotiations with employee representatives and sometimes the government. After two weeks of such discussions, Amazon reduced its job cuts in Luxembourg from 470 to 370, Bloomberg added. Amazon will notify a number of the affected employees of their termination in February, Chandrasekhar said. The report added that Amazon's layoffs in the 680,000-population country could trigger some “speed bumps” in the so far mutually beneficial relationship between the tech giant and tax haven nation. Luxembourg is known as a tax haven and financial centre with relatively high wages and low-income taxes, which have benefited many foreign companies. Amazon has since 2003 steadily expanded in the country and even after the layoffs will be Luxembourg’s fifth-largest employer. An employee told Bloomberg anonymously that most of the cuts are expected to be among software developers as artificial intelligence (AI) use grows, and to “trim” the workforce hired during the pandemic-era boom. The General Luxembourg Workers’ Organization (OGBL) union and other unions allege that Amazon has been granted “outsized” tax benefits in Luxembourg. The BB report said that Amazon and other foreign companies have set up holding companies in Luxembourg, through which they funnel European operations. It added that Amazon uses accounting rules deemed legal by European courts in 2023 to routinely declare losses on its continental operations and minimise tax burden. Last year, according to public records, the Luxembourg-based holding company Amazon EU Sarl reported €70.4 billion ($82.8 billion) in EU e-commerce sales and almost the same amount of expenses, including employee costs, leaving the company with a tax on profit of just €180 million. In November, Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden met Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in Seattle, and later stressed in a LinkedIn post that the company remains a “vital partner” for Luxembourg. In a comment under the post, Jassy replied, “Luxembourg’s been an important home for Amazon and our 4,000 teammates there. Appreciated the discussion and partnership.” (With inputs from Bloomberg) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

December 18, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SANTA CLARA, CA - December 18, 2025 - - The global technology sector is entering a period of structural workforce realignment as artificial intelligence reshapes how work is performed inside large enterprises. Recent layoffs across major technology firms, coupled with record levels of investment in AI infrastructure and automation, indicate a strategic shift in hiring priorities rather than a cyclical slowdown, according to industry analysts tracking employment and capital allocation trends across the sector. One organization addressing this shift is Interview Kickstart, an upskilling platform that offers training programs focused on AI, machine learning, and advanced engineering roles thorugh its Advanced Generative AI program. Publicly reported data indicates that more than 100,000 roles have been eliminated across the global technology sector in 2025, with workforce reductions occurring at companies commonly grouped under the FAANG umbrella as well as other large enterprises. These workforce changes have coincided with sustained investment in AI-related initiatives, including infrastructure, tooling, and research, signaling a reallocation of resources rather than a retreat from innovation. Executives at several major technology companies have acknowledged that AI is altering how work is performed. Public statements from industry leaders have emphasized the need for organizations to redesign workflows, automate routine tasks, and increase productivity through AI-assisted systems. In many cases, this has involved consolidating teams and prioritizing roles that focus on system-level decision-making, AI deployment, and operational oversight. At the same time, companies have continued to invest heavily in AI platforms and services. Financial disclosures and earnings calls across the sector show that capital expenditure on AI infrastructure has increased year over year, reflecting long-term strategic commitments. Industry observers note that this combination of workforce reductions and AI investment suggests a structural realignment of job roles rather than a contraction of the technology sector as a whole. This environment has created a complex landscape for technology professionals. Roles centered on routine implementation, manual processes, or narrowly defined responsibilities are increasingly vulnerable to automation. Conversely, demand continues to grow for professionals who can design, build, deploy, and manage AI systems in production environments. These roles often require a blend of engineering fundamentals, applied AI knowledge, and the ability to evaluate trade-offs in complex systems. Recruiters and hiring managers report that job descriptions are evolving accordingly. Many roles now emphasize experience with machine learning pipelines, generative AI systems, autonomous agents, and AI-assisted workflows, alongside traditional software engineering and system design skills. This has prompted many professionals to reassess their skill sets and pursue structured upskilling as a way to remain competitive. Interview Kickstart provides structured learning pathways designed to help professionals develop applied skills aligned with current hiring expectations at large technology firms. The offerings include multi-month programs that cover foundational machine learning concepts, deep learning, generative AI, and agent-based systems. The curriculum emphasizes practical application, with live instruction and project work intended to reflect real-world use cases. According to the company, these programs are designed to support professionals transitioning from adjacent technical roles as well as those seeking deeper specialization in AI-driven systems. In addition to technical instruction, Interview Kickstart integrates interview preparation and career coaching into its programs. Participants receive feedback from instructors with industry experience, along with mock interviews designed to mirror hiring processes at large technology companies. This approach reflects the increasingly rigorous evaluation standards used for AI-related roles, which often assess both technical depth and decision-making ability. Industry analysts note that traditional, short-term upskilling approaches may be insufficient in this environment. As AI capabilities expand, employers are placing greater value on professionals who can operate across the full lifecycle of AI systems, from design and deployment to monitoring and optimization. This has elevated the importance of sustained, structured learning over ad hoc skill acquisition. While the pace of change has introduced uncertainty for many technology workers, it has also clarified the types of expertise likely to remain relevant. Professionals with production-level AI experience, strong engineering fundamentals, and the ability to adapt to evolving tools are expected to play a central role in the next phase of the technology sector's development. As companies continue to integrate AI into their operations, workforce transformation is likely to remain a defining feature of the industry. For professionals navigating this transition, access to structured education and practical training may be a key factor in aligning their skills with the demands of an AI-driven economy.

Title: The AI efficiency illusion: why cutting 1.1 million jobs will stifle, not scale, your strategy
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/18/the-ai-efficiency-illusion-why-cutting-1-1-million-jobs-will-stifle-not-scale-your-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T18:23:12Z
Full Content:
We are witnessing a false dawn of efficiency. Throughout 2025, corporate America has engaged in a frantic restructuring of the labor market, cutting more than 1.17 million jobs in the first 11 months of the year, a 54% increase from 2024. From the 14,000 corporate cuts at tech giants like Amazon to the nearly 300,000 federal civil service reductions, the narrative driving this contraction is uniform: we are shedding excess labor to make room for the streamlined, high-margin future of artificial intelligence. But the data tells a different story. This is not a calculated pivot toward higher productivity. It is a hollowing-out strategy that trades immediate payroll savings for a catastrophic erosion of human capital. By viewing AI as a mechanism for replacement rather than augmentation, leaders are incurring a strategic debt that will erase future value, stifle innovation, and, crucially, institutionalize the kind of algorithmic bias that costs companies billions. We are trying to build the future of work by burning down the infrastructure required to support it. The prevailing logic in the C-Suite is a simple subtraction equation: lower headcount plus automated tools equals higher margins. However, this ignores the negative externalities imposed on the workforce that remains. While companies explicitly cited AI for roughly 55,000 cuts through November, there are far more job losses buried under the umbrella of restructuring, which accounted for over 128,000 job losses. Expert estimates suggest the true automation-influenced displacement is likely above 150,000. But the real cost isn’t on the severance line item; it is in the collapse of productivity among the survivors. Seventy-four percent of employees who survive layoffs report a decline in their own productivity, while 77% witness an increase in operational errors. This phenomenon, often called the layoff survivor syndrome, is a drag on performance fueled by anxiety and the erosion of institutional trust. Volatility sends a signal to your top performers: leave before you are pushed out. When companies cut costs by eliminating human capacity, they don’t get a leaner organization; they get an anxious, risk-averse, and error-prone one. The so-called productivity equation turns negative because the marginal productivity of the retained workforce plummets faster than the payroll costs decline. This productivity collapse is compounded by a fundamental misunderstanding of how AI generates value. While 85% of organizations are increasing their AI investment, only 6% are seeing a payback in under a year. The answer lies in the implementation. A staggering 59% of organizations are taking a technology-first approach, treating AI as a bolt-on solution rather than undertaking organizational redesign. Even more alarming is where the cuts are happening. The 2025 layoffs are disproportionately targeting mid-layer management, including HR, talent acquisition, and compliance roles. The result is a growing governance gap. At the exact moment companies are deploying black-box algorithms that require intense oversight, they are firing the overseers. 34% of organizations already expect a shortage in specialist compliance skills. By dismantling these internal guardrails, companies are not streamlining; they are removing the ethical braking systems required to prevent reputational and financial ruin. AI is not a replacement for human judgment; it is an accelerator of it. But you cannot accelerate what you have already liquidated. Here is where the economic argument becomes inseparable from the equity argument. The hollowing out of 2025 has not been neutral. It has systematically targeted the very demographics that drive financial outperformance. The data reveal a profound asymmetry in risk exposure. Women are significantly more vulnerable to the current wave of automation, with 79% of employed women concentrated in high-risk occupations compared to 58% of men. This differential means women are 1.4 times more exposed to displacement. We see this specifically in the hollowing out of critical pipeline positions that enable women to ascend to leadership. However, the canary in the coal mine for the broader economy is the crisis facing Black women. By November 2025, the unemployment rate for Black women remained at a staggering 7.1%, more than double the 3.4% rate for White women. This was driven by a perfect storm: high exposure to private sector automation combined with the erasure of 300,000 federal jobs, a sector where Black women have historically found stability. The reality on the ground confirms this is a systemic failure, not a skills gap. Keisha Bross, Director of Opportunity, Race and Justice at the NAACP, reports that she has “not seen interventions happening” to support this displaced workforce. The result? At recent NAACP job fairs, 80% of applicants held bachelor’s degrees yet were lining up for same-day interviews for low-wage roles. We are witnessing the hollowing out of the Black middle class in real-time. Leaders often view these statistics as a social problem. They are wrong. This is a P&L problem. There is a hard, quantitative link between intersectional equity and revenue. Research across more than 4,000 companies in 29 countries shows that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there is a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Venture capital data further reinforces this, showing that investments in female-founded startups yield a 63% better return on investment than those with male founders. By allowing layoffs to disproportionately target women and people of color, companies are forfeiting a measurable economic dividend. The financial danger of a homogenous workforce extends directly into the AI models themselves. If your AI team and your data sources lack diversity, your algorithms will be biased. This is no longer a theoretical risk—it is a tangible liability. More than one-third of organizations have already suffered negative impacts from AI bias, with 62% reporting lost revenue and 61% reporting lost customers. The legal doctrine of disparate impact creates massive liability for companies whose algorithms discriminate in hiring or lending, regardless of intent. This tension is starkly visible. On one side, we have the nation’s largest civil rights organization, the NAACP, flagging systemic risk. On the other, we have tech giants like Google and Meta, recently crowned Time’s ‘Person of the Year’, who landed on the NAACP’s Consumer Advisory List by rolling back the very protections meant to ensure that revolution is equitable. This contradiction is not ideological; it’s economic: alienating a demographic with $1.7 trillion in annual buying power. When you remove the diverse talent capable of spotting bias, and the compliance officers capable of reporting it, you guarantee that your AI products will be flawed, biased, and ultimately, litigated. To reverse this erosion of value, executives must stop viewing labor as a cost to be minimized and start viewing work design as the primary investment vehicle for AI success. AI governance must move from the server room to the Boardroom. Boards must include members with the technical literacy to challenge management on model stability and data quality. We must recognize that responsible AI unlocks value and accelerates development by ensuring reliability. We must shift our strategy from automation (replacing heads) to augmentation (increasing value). Data shows that job numbers actually grow in AI-exposed fields when companies focus on augmentation. This requires a massive investment in skilling, specifically targeting the non-degree holders who are 3.5 times more likely to lose their jobs. Finally, we must embed intersectional equity into the core business strategy. This means using advanced analytics to monitor the talent lifecycle and ensure that restructuring efforts do not decimate the diversity pipeline. It means recognizing that the $12 trillion global economic opportunity of gender equity is only accessible if we actively retain women in the workforce. The 1.17 million layoffs of 2025 represent a fork in the road. One path leads to a hollowed-out future: a short-term spike in cash flow followed by a long-term decline in innovation, a rise in algorithmic liability, and a workforce paralyzed by fear. The other path recognizes that in the age of AI, humanity is the premium asset. It acknowledges that the only way to capture the exponential ROI of automation is to pair it with a diverse, resilient, and empowered human workforce. You can cut your way to a quarterly profit, but you cannot cut your way to the future. True productivity requires us to stop subtracting humans and start solving for the convergence of equity, economics, and engineering.

Title: US jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 last week as layoffs remain low

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said.

By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Glen Schofield has been on a roll with insights that are making waves in the video game industry of late. Known as the founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, Schofield opened up a can of worms when he detailed the “bittersweet” transformation of video game publishing juggernauts, Electronic Arts and Activision. Schofield spearheaded Dead Space at EA in 2008 and worked on its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, before departing from Striking Distance earlier in 2023. In the LinkedIn post, he looked back on his decade-long tenure at both companies during their heydays. After the word came out about EA’s pivot into private ownership by Saudi Arabia’s PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal, similar to Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard Acquisition, Schofield finally chimed in on the conversation on LinkedIn. Schofield drew parallels between the two companies and said, “In the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras.” Schofield expressed emotional turmoil, reflecting on his career at both studios, adding: I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes. Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected. It’s not without reason that Schofield viewed EA and Activision as crucibles for talent. He further detailed: EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense, no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood. Activision was a different playing field, he said, stating it was: Where review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another. However, the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal, and somehow, the time felt well spent. Schofield went down nostalgia lane, stating that both companies honed and bred a new generation of developers, but that time seems short-lived in light of recent acquisitions. He concluded the interview, stating: It’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. Mine included. His comments come at a time when the industry as a whole is reeling from a series of layoffs as AI becomes a more prominent feature in titles, and game publishers and developers alike continue to chase profitability amid rising costs and increased competition. They provide unique insight into how developers view two of the most iconic game publishers in the industry, even amid continued volatility.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announces departure of AI exec Rohit Prasad in leadership shakeup

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dropped an AI bombshell on employees today, announcing that Rohit Prasad—who has led Amazon’s so-called AGI (artificial general intelligence) team since 2023, overseeing the development of the company’s Nova models—will depart at the end of the year. Prasad previously served as the head scientist behind Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, a role he held from the product’s earliest days. When he was appointed to lead the new ambitious AGI effort after ChatGPT launched in November 2022, as part of a scramble to develop a competitive LLM that could help reinvigorate the Alexa voice assistant, it was led almost entirely by ex–Alexa executives. In a blog post, Jassy announced that longtime Amazon Web Services (AWS) executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new organization that drives the development of its AI models, custom computer chips (which include its Graviton, Trainium, and Nitro chips), and quantum computing efforts. DeSantis has overseen the many teams designing AWS’s global infrastructure. “With our Nova 2 models just launched at Re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote, adding that DeSantis would report directly to him.Jassy also said that as part of the organizational change, Pieter Abbeel, an Amazon Distinguished Scientist in robotics who is also an AI and robotics professor at UC Berkeley, will lead the company’s frontier model research team. Abbeel came to Amazon in 2024 along with other cofounders of his robotics startup Covariant, in a deal that also saw Amazon licensing Covariant’s software, which included AI models that gave robots the ability to quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. “Pieter is one of the world’s leading AI researchers and cofounder of Covariant, which pioneered the first commercial foundation model for robotics,” Jassy wrote. “His deep expertise in generative AI and reinforcement learning makes him well-suited to advance Amazon’s AI research as we push the boundaries of what’s possible for customers.” The news of Prasad’s departure comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that he was recently at Amazon’s Re:Invent conference discussing the latest Nova models. However, over the past two years there has been significant media coverage suggesting that Amazon’s Alexa AI and AGI-related efforts have struggled and fallen behind competitors. A year ago, for example, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey reported exclusively that leaked Amazon documents identified critical flaws in the delayed AI reboot of Alexa. And in June 2024, Fortune reported that Amazon had blown Alexa’s shot to dominate AI, according to more than a dozen employees who worked on it—partly owing to a lack of adequate data, even though Prasad pushed the AGI team to work harder and harder, with a message to “get some magic” out of the LLM. In addition, last week’s Amazon layoffs fueled concerns about whether Amazon was still lagging behind in AI, and whether the cuts reflected slowing growth. That came on the heels of comments in October by analyst Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, who said Amazon’s AWS was in “last place” in the AI cloud race. However, The Information as well as Bloomberg reported this week that Amazon was in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI, in turn, had agreed to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips, perhaps helping counter the narrative that the company is behind in AI. OpenAI had previously agreed to spend $38 billion using AWS for computing.Amazon also has a deal with AI company Anthropic, in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. Anthropic has agreed to use AWS’s Trainium chips for training, and Anthropic’s Claude model is being used to answer some queries in the new Alexa Plus.

Title: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are awarding $5 million to a leader in neurodiversity education

By JAMES POLLARD NEW YORK (AP) — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said.

Title: The Trade Desk Lays Off Staff One Year After Its Last Major Reorg

The Trade Desk is cutting its workforce. A company spokesperson confirmed the news with AdExchanger. The layoffs affect less than 1% of the company. The Trade Desk’s current headcount is approximately 3,900. TTD is hosting an all-hands meeting at 12:30 pm eastern to go over the news with remaining employees. In a statement, a spokesperson from The Trade Desk noted that TTD has hired nearly 1,000 people this year, including “dozens” at the senior leadership level. Still, there have been several recent notable departures, including Jud Spencer, who was a lead engineer at TTD for more than 12 years. He left in November. Tuesday’s reorg “is part of our mission to constantly ensure we have the right skills and experiences in place to drive innovation and value for the world’s biggest advertisers in what is a fast-evolving ad tech environment,” the TTD spokesperson said. “And as part of that, a handful of folks are moving on from The Trade Desk.” The restructuring comes almost exactly one year after The Trade Desk underwent what CEO Jeff Green described as “the biggest reorganization” in the company’s history. That reorg, which took place last December, involved restructuring TTD’s client-facing teams, Green told investors in February during the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call. He said this shift was designed to improve how TTD serves advertisers and agencies. That disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report – which included TTD’s first-ever earnings miss – marked the start of a turbulent year for The Trade Desk, including growing pressure from Amazon and Google, its main rivals in the DSP market. During that call, Green acknowledged short-term disruptions caused by the reorg, but said it was necessary to position TTD for efficiency and growth. The layoffs on Tuesday suggest TTD is still adjusting to those changes as it works to balance efficiency with expansion heading into 2026. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. This most recent restructuring also lands amid heightened scrutiny of programmatic supply chains following industry debates – instigated by TTD – about reseller transparency. The Trade Desk has positioned itself as a vocal proponent of greater accountability for advertisers across the open web, but its stance – and the release of OpenAds, its forked version of Prebid’s wrapper – have introduced new friction points between TTD and sell-side platforms. At the same time, The Trade Desk is still leaning into Kokai, the AI-powered update to its media buying platform, which launched in 2023. Despite operational growing plans, Kokai remains central to TTD’s long-term strategy as it continues to face intensifying competition from Amazon and mounting investor pressure to prove that its AI investments can drive meaningful growth.

Title: Jeff Bezos and wife Lauren Sánchez awarding $5M to founder of a neurodiversity education network

NEW YORK — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher-profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria, and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice.

The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra-wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot, whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity, and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater,” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools.

Since early 2022, just before widespread AI-hype, U.S. job-openings as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have fallen from roughly 12.1 million to about 7.7 million, a decline of approximately 36%. Over the same period, the S&P 500’s total return (price plus dividends) is roughly 48%, reflecting strong equity markets. Conventional wisdom would tell you a booming stock market should create more jobs, not fewer. But it’s hard to ignore that there are larger forces at play, and a potential harbinger of how companies are starting to view their workforces. According to a new report from the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp), 2026 will be the year that large companies stop treating AI merely as a productivity tool and start wielding it as a strategic lever for workforce restructuring. That’s a far cry from the typical corporate talking points. How many times have we heard executives tout AI as a thought partner, a collaborator, a productivity accelerator? Or as a catalyst for upskilling and repurposing people? And yet, we’re already seeing evidence of this trend. In 2025 alone, UPS cut 48,000, Amazon eliminated 14,000 jobs, and Verizon announced plans to lay off 15,000 employees. The reason for all these cuts? While restructuring, the need for different skills, and business optimization are all frequently cited, increasingly AI is as well. In fact, a World Economic Forum survey found 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of AI. Reduction doesn’t just mean layoffs; AI is also being used as a reason hiring has slowed in many companies. Of course, not all layoffs or hiring slowdowns will be AI-driven. Some of these changes reflect broader economic “cooling” after the post-COVID hiring boom. Other layoffs are designed to instill more agility in workforces, with some prominent CEOs such as Amazon’s Andy Jassy saying as much. But workers should adjust their expectations and recognize that some companies aren’t fretting about whether or not their employees can adapt to AI. Instead they’re using layoffs as a way to accelerate that adaption. Using AI-driven layoffs as a strategic lever dovetails with three other trends i4cp sees emerging or strengthening in 2026. The first is the need for organizations to be more skills-based. i4cp research shows that companies with high “skills readiness,” or the confidence that their workforce has the skills needed for the next three years, are 12 times more likely to offer upskilling to employees. They are also six times more likely to have cataloged the skills and capabilities of their workforces, and are six times more likely to determine which tasks are best performed by humans versus AI, and vice versa. For decades companies have asked “How many employees do we need?” Instead, high-performing organizations are increasingly asking, “What work needs to be done and who (or what) has the capabilities to do it?” Already, companies like Target and Dow are using custom GPT tools and AI-powered interview guides to help managers connect skills data to business decisions in real time. The path is clear: skills will be the shared language connecting business strategy, tech and talent. In addition to upskilling efforts, i4cp also expects that by the end of 2026, it won’t be uncommon for some professionals to have a personal AI “work twin,” or a digital counterpart trained on their workflows, communication styles and task patterns. While this evolution won’t happen overnight and still seems somewhat in the realm of science fiction, high-performing companies are already realizing that AI isn’t just a tool, but a teammate. Such collaboration will bring new management concerns, such as, “When an employee leaves, does the twin remain?” Or “How do we measure productivity when part of the workforce never sleeps?” This leap in digital work twins will require new governance, new leadership development programs and new mindsets. Best-in-class companies will treat the AI-human relationship as a trust partnership, experimenting with what work is best suited for AI agents versus humans. While twins obviously can be a significant productivity multiplier, companies will need to ensure that doesn’t happen at the expense of organizational culture. All of this shifting also means that leading companies will have more fluid, modular workforces, with systems in place that can match emerging work needs with available capabilities. This will require managers and HR leaders to continuously shape and redeploy teams (of both humans and digital contributors), akin to managing a supply chain rather than a static roster. The organizations that thrive next year and beyond will embrace fluid workforces, treat skills as the company operating system, and work with AI as a trusted collaborator. The defining factor for success will ultimately be which firms navigate this transformation without sacrificing the human elements that ultimately drive growth and innovation.

Title: Bernie Sanders calls for halt on AI data center construction — wants to ensure that the technology benefits ‘all of us, not just the 1%’

"Is that the kind of future you want?" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said that he will push for a moratorium on the construction of AI data centers to ensure that the technology will be useful for the greatest number of Americans and not just the few multi-billionaires who are advocating for the widespread use of artificial intelligence. According to the senator’s X post, this delay “will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%.” Sanders raised three points in his short video: ‘Who is aggressively pushing AI?’; ‘What will AI and robotics mean economically for the working class of this country?’; and ‘Millions of kids in this country are becoming more and more isolated from real human relationships and are getting their emotional support from AI.’ I will be pushing for a moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop & deploy AI.The moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%. pic.twitter.com/PoV5ziA4oQDecember 16, 2025 The current AI build-out is largely driven by big tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Oracle, and Meta, among others. With trillions of dollars being poured into the infrastructure required to support artificial intelligence, many experts are warning that it’s becoming unsustainable and that we are already in an AI bubble. Aside from this, Microsoft’s push for Copilot+ AI PCs did not deliver the sales it was expecting, with most consumers simply purchasing AI PCs because there’s no other option when upgrading from Windows 10. There have also been concerns about AI replacing people in the workforce. While this hasn’t resulted in widespread layoffs yet, MIT estimates that AI could replace up to 11.7% of American workers across industries, not just in tech. Even Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that the widespread use of this technology could result in up to 20% unemployment within the next five years, with Ford CEO Jim Farley warning that it will wipe out nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Sanders also raised concerns about children using AI for companionship instead of building relationships with other people. “Think for a moment about a future when human beings are not interacting with each other and are spending virtually all of their time with devices instead of people,” Sanders said. “Is that the kind of future you want? Well, not me.” The senator from Vermont wants to halt all progress on AI data center construction to address these issues first. He also isn’t the only one concerned about the possible negative impacts of artificial intelligence on society, as Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other Democrat senators recently sent letters recently to several big tech companies asking them to explain how their AI data centers are impacting residential energy bills. These moves directly contradict the current administration’s goal of turning the U.S. into an AI powerhouse, with Trump signing an executive order for the so-called ‘Genesis Mission’ — an initiative to drive AI development across the country — and is even comparing its scale with the Manhattan Project.

When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates. ChatGPT isn't one of them. "There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet," Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, "The economy is paralyzed." The labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the "flattening" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary. Given the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're "all in on AI," often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble. But, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck. If you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell. There is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called "Scariest Chart in the World." The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.

As chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI "for every task possible," Microsoft is "rethinking" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots. But is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not. Ajilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is "overblown." Many companies are "using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient," he said, "With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners." He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI "is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet." There's also an important piece of context missing from "The Scariest Chart in the World": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates. When interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees. It's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end. This sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference "modest to strong" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that "Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity," another said "labor demand weakened overall," pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown. Corporate America began to lean into "efficiency" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue. The trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors "reduced hiring plans" and were "rightsizing" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, "uncertainty" and "tariffs" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls. But saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable. "I think that what's happening is just simple economics," she said, adding, "But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI." Each recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete. "I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think," said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. "There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable," he said. "But it won't be cataclysmic." The job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit. Despite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully. A pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, "Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs." Declining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's "efficiency" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers. Economists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate. Allie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

Title: AWS CEO says replacing young employees with AI is ‘one of the dumbest ideas’—and bad for business: ‘At some point the whole thing explodes on itself’

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned of AI displacing entry-level workers, and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tech will wipe out half of white-collar jobs, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman has a wildly different take on young workers’ fate in the age of AI. Earlier this year, Garman said replacing junior software developers with AI was “one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard,” and it’s a point he stands by. In an interview with WIRED published on Tuesday, Garman said displacing junior engineers and employees with new tech is a bad business move. Entry-level workers are usually paid the least, meaning getting rid of their positions first in favor of higher-paid senior talent is not a cost-effective strategy, he noted. Moreso, these fresh-faced young workers are likely recent college graduates with energy, excitement, and deep familiarity with AI tools. Eliminating them, in Garman’s eyes, would be myopic. “At some point that whole thing explodes on itself,” Garman said. “If you have no talent pipeline that you’re building and no junior people that you’re mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that’s where we get some of the best ideas.” “You’ve gotta think longer term about the health of a company,” he added. “And just saying ‘OK great, we’re never going to hire junior people anymore,’ that’s just a nonstarter for anyone who’s trying to build a long-term company.” A Stanford University study published in August suggested AI is already starting to have its way with entry-level workers. The research revealed that “the AI revolution” is having a “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market,” particularly 22- to 25-year-old software engineers and customer service agents. Despite Garman’s adamance on AI not replacing young workers, Amazon’s own automation advancements have coincided with the company laying off thousands of employees this fall. The tech giant announced in October it would slash 14,000 jobs, mostly middle management positions. Earlier this year, Amazon laid off a smaller portion of workers from divisions including AWS, its Wondery podcast division, and the consumer devices unit. Rather than attribute the axings to AI, Amazon instead said the layoffs were part of an effort to make the business more efficient after a period of growth, as well as resolve cultural mismatches that emerged in the workforce. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” CEO Andy Jassy said at the time. “It’s culture.” Still, AI advancements are poised to impact Amazon’s workforce. The memo outlining the fall layoffs cites the transforming technology of AI as the impetus for improving workflows with leaner teams. A June memo from the company said AI efficiency gains will “reduce our total corporate workforce,” and a New York Times investigation published in October reported Amazon had a lofty goal to automate 75% of its work, translating to about 600,000 jobs the tech giant would not ultimately need to hire for. AWS did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Garman isn’t naive to the workplace upheaval AI could bring. He predicted the technology will initially create a burst of new jobs, as well as reduce several roles, but he was certain that AI would ultimately transform the nature of work. “One of the things that I tell our own employees is ‘Your job is going to change.’ There’s no two ways about it,” he told WIRED. The 49-year-old AWS CEO said employees have the potential to have more impact and responsibilities as a result of AI, but it will require learning news skills, as well as organizing teams differently. While entry-level workers should not be the primary victims of AI’s workplace shake-ups, other jobs and industries will be impacted, Garman noticed. “If they don’t, they’ll most likely get left behind by people who move faster and do change,” he said. “There is going to be some disruption in there for sure. Like there is no question in my mind.”

Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments. Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are "adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies." The company claims to be going "well beyond industry benchmarks" in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it's offering. An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don't land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000. One employee told Bloomberg that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks. Amazon said in October it would cut 14,000 jobs from its global workforce amid its deepening embrace of AI. It was reported that same month that the company's plans to ramp up its robotics operations could put around half a million jobs in the US at risk.

By Eddie Makuch on December 16, 2025 at 6:49AM PST Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft. He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield. Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle." "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said. Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs." March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles. The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company, including at its gaming division. Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: How the experts predict digital ad spend will pan out in 2026

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → U.S. advertising spending is now forecast to grow 6.6% next year — that’s not taking into account political ad spend that occurred in 2025 — down from an estimated 11% in the past 12 months, according to the latest analysis from Madison & Wall. The findings are reflected in a similar global forecast from media consultancy Ebiquity, which found that almost half (48%) of marketers expect to increase their media spend next year, with digital video and CTV likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, sources predict this moderate growth is most likely to be concentrated in a few hands, with the titans of Silicon Valley on course to benefit most from this trend. Per Madison & Wall’s revised assessment, programmatic spend follows stronger-than-expected performance in 2025 and reflects a moderation in growth rather than a downturn. For programmatic advertising, the forecast points to continued expansion in automated buying, concentrated in digital formats that deliver measurable performance, while much of the open internet — that includes independent ad tech — is under intense pressure to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. The upgrade comes after another strong quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% year over year in Q3 2025, excluding political spending, the fastest quarterly pace since early 2022 (see chart). Digital advertising increased 21%, raising digital’s share of total ad spend to 72%, with the forecast underscoring the continued dominance of channels with first-party data, closed-loop measurement, and AI-driven optimization. Looking ahead, Madison & Wall expects economic conditions to remain broadly supportive in 2026, despite rising policy and geopolitical risks. Consensus forecasts point to real GDP growth of roughly 1.8% and inflation near 2.8%, implying nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5%. While the correlation between economic growth and advertising has weakened, the firm views nominal growth as a meaningful reference point for advertising demand. It expects advertising growth to slow gradually rather than correct sharply. Within that environment, programmatic advertising is expected to increase its share of open internet transactions. Madison & Wall forecasts programmatic revenues across the open internet to grow 4.4% in 2026, with programmatic accounting for 74% of open internet ad revenues. Growth is expected to be driven by programmatic connected TV, digital out-of-home, and digital audio, each projected to grow at double-digit rates as automation expands across newer digital formats. However, total open internet advertising revenues are expected to be roughly flat. Programmatic growth in 2026 is therefore driven primarily by a shift in buying methods rather than an expansion of overall spend. Programmatic revenues tied to digital platforms and publishers are expected to decline slightly, reflecting ongoing pricing pressure and uneven demand outside large-scale platforms. In his end-of-year assessment, W Media Research‘s Karsten Weide remarked how much of the ad tech ecosystem on the open internet was in open conflict, highlighting how the Q3 dispute of transaction IDs, or “TIDs,” between buy- and sell-side players is an open wound. “What once sounded like a technical dispute over wrappers and auction mechanics has escalated into a power struggle over who governs the open internet,” he noted. By contrast, closed digital platforms are expected to continue to capture a disproportionate share of incremental spending. Madison & Wall forecasts commerce media to grow 16% in 2026, social media 15%, and search 8%. The firm expects ad tech platforms to introduce additional AI-powered buying tools designed to replicate the automated, outcome-focused buying models already prevalent within walled gardens. Madison & Wall further noted how advertisers are placing greater emphasis on price and performance, often at the expense of transparency and control, with spend increasingly directed toward platforms that bundle creative, optimization, and measurement within the cost of inventory. Direct relationships between advertisers and large media owners continue to expand; this is a trend that reduces reliance on agency-managed buying systems, with Madison & Wall expecting AI to enhance this trend as more workflow tools are made available in the industry. Meanwhile, search and commerce advertising are expected to remain structurally resilient, while publishers across the open internet face greater pressure to adapt their business models. In that context, programmatic advertising continues to function as a core transaction layer — growing in importance, but operating within a more constrained overall market. “If I have the opportunity to leave, I’m leaving. Omnicom is NOT competitive in my eyes. Their benefits suck and they are moving away from creative driven [sic] work and focusing on data driven [sic] work and pumping out as much content as possible.” — An Omnicom staff member speaks truth to power on the gift that keeps on giving, i.e., the OmnicomIPGmerger subreddit, while others use other threads to estimate that the layoffs are not even halfway done. From the 2026 Integral Ad Science Industry Pulse Report: WPP estimates commerce media spending to overtake TV this year The company’s latest global ad spend forecasts predict that commerce media will account for 15.6% of global ad spend in 2025, compared with the 14.6% spent on linear and connected TV. The case against AI agents for programmatic ad buying Christopher Francia, director of product development and client performance at Attention Arc explains discusses whether or not AI agents be involved in programmatic ad buys. Plot spoiler: “We’re not trusting that to large language model-based agents.” Google tells advertisers it’ll bring ads to Gemini in 2026 Google has said to advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its AI chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations, according to Adweek’s Trishla Ostwal. AI brings MFA to social media… how advertisers can avoid it Zefr CEO Rich Raddon argues that generative AI has led to the re-emergence of an unwelcome visitor from the past for most advertisers. X shuts down EU’s ad account after first major DSA fine The European Commission issued a €120 million fine to X — its first fine issued under the Digital Services Act (DSA) following prior allegations. Following the fine and a public response from X CEO Elon Musk, X shut down the Commission’s ad account. Advertiser battles Google, alleges failure to disclose queries “Google prioritizes profit over integrity by using its Google Ads program to deceive its customers, primarily small businesses, out of their hard-earned money,” the advertiser argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Case Pitts in San Jose. “Since 2020, Google has accomplished this grift, by hiding a significant portion of its client charges inside an impenetrable ‘black box’ that not even Houdini could open.” OpenPath offers buyers a “cleaner” route to publishers, but some are concerned about lack of clarity over indirect costs. Over the past year, Roblox has become harder for brands to ignore — not because it has resolved the challenges of digital commerce, but because of the scale at which younger consumers already use it. Corporate development sources estimate the deal valuation to be above $300 million, claiming tvScientific’s gross revenue is approximately $100 million.

Title: The robot revolution

Time Published: 2025-12-15T22:52:01Z

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Advances in tech and AI are producing android machine workers. What will that mean for humans? Humanoid robots that can obey commands, make decisions, and deftly perform manual tasks have long been a sci-fi fantasy. Now they are becoming reality. Artificial intelligence, coupled with advances in robotics, has the potential to give humanoid robots unprecedented power to analyze, “think,” and learn. Tech evangelists say these robots will have a transformative impact on workplaces and even in our homes, and not in distant decades but in the next few years. Elon Musk believes robots will be “the biggest product ever in history.” His Tesla robot Optimus can already climb stairs and carry 45-pound objects, and he says Tesla will deliver a million units a year by 2030. By 2035, Citigroup predicts, some 1.3 billion robots will be in operation, both in industrial settings and in households, nursing homes, and construction sites. “By the 2040s,” said Adam Dorr, research director at the analytics firm RethinkX, “there will be almost nothing a robot can’t do better and cheaper than a human.” China already has more than 2 million of them working in factories, and the U.S. is rushing to catch up. In workplaces across America, robots are lifting boxes, transporting goods, even flipping burgers. At a Spanx warehouse outside Atlanta, humanoid bots pluck baskets of clothes from wheeled bots and set them on conveyor belts. To unpack trucks in several facilities, the shipping company DHL uses wheeled Stretch robots from Boston Dynamics, which can lift 50-pound boxes using flexible arms covered in vacuum suction cups. Just one can unload nearly 600 cases per hour, nearly double what humans can do. BMW just finished a pilot program in Spartanburg, S.C., where robot tasks included loading sheet metal parts into a welder. Even small firms are getting in on the action. Greg LeFevre is CEO of Raymath, a metal-fabrication company in Troy, Ohio. His factory is using 13 robot arms, supervised by his human employees, and he says the machines can work around the clock and can execute tricky aluminum welds “anywhere from two to six times faster” than a person. But it’s the nation’s second-largest private employer, Amazon, that is taking the biggest leap. It has a million robots working in various capacities and says some 75% of its global deliveries are assisted by robotics. At its 3-million-square-foot “next generation” facility in Shreveport, La., some 1,000 robots of various shapes and sizes shuttle pallets across floors, pluck items from storage bins, and load packages onto carts. Citing internal documents, The New York Times reported last month that Amazon is on track to replace some 600,000 jobs with robots in the coming years, even with sales projected to double by 2033. Its transformation will be closely watched, said Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor who studies automation. “Once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others too.” Escape your echo chamber.

Robot enthusiasts say the next frontier after warehouses and factories will be homes. The California robotics firm 1X Technologies is taking $20,000 preorders for its Neo robots, with expected delivery next year. The 5-foot, 6-inch humanoids—which currently require remote human operators to joystick them around but will eventually be autonomous—will not just clean toilets and load dishwashers. They’ll also be able to share jokes and engage in “lively, natural conversations,” says the firm. CEO Bernt Bornich believes users will rely on them for both cleaning and companionship. “I don’t think it’s another person, and it’s not a pet,” he said. “It’s something else.” There’s no question robots will take away some jobs, but the net effect is a matter of debate. Tech CEOs are quick to say that in fact new higher-skilled jobs will be created—like the position of robot wrangler—and that robots will largely fill dull jobs that most people don’t want. The bots unloading DHS trucks, for example, do “the most hated job in a warehouse,” said Marc Theermann of Boston Dynamics. But some scientists say the robot revolution is still far off, because the machines still have significant physical limitations. Those who think android plumbers and cooks will soon proliferate should “reset expectations,” said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at University of California, Berkeley. For one thing, it’s proved very hard to endow them with the dexterity to manipulate objects, such as “pick up a wine glass or change a light bulb,” he said. “No robot can do that.” Robot evangelists say yes. They say robots are learning so quickly that their advent will inevitably lead to labor-market upheaval. Kavin, a 27-year-old who helps train AI robots to fold clothes in India, says the humanoids aren’t perfect. “Sometimes the robot’s arms throw the clothes,” he says. “Sometimes it scatters the stack.” But he says they’re improving to the point where soon, “they’ll be able to do all the jobs, and there will be none left for us.” Anticipating pushback over mass layoffs, Amazon is reportedly developing plans to mitigate the fallout through community outreach, and other companies are commissioning studies on possible impacts. “We’re basically going to live in a world,” says Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure AI, “where any physical labor is a choice.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com The Explainer Make the most of your present IN THE SPOTLIGHT A bovine outbreak coupled with ongoing governmental frustrations is causing major problems for French civil society The Week Recommends A deep dive into the site of a mass shooting, a new release from the author of ‘Atonement’ and more In the Spotlight Tariffs and cheaper rivals have displaced the innovative robot company Under the Radar Some say the machines help people mourn; others are skeptical Feature The tech mogul’s vision for virtual worlds inhabited by millions of users was clearly a flop Speed Read Kids under age 16 are now barred from platforms including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit Feature If you get a puzzling text message from a stranger, you may be the target of ‘pig butchering.’ The Week Recommends Advanced AI may have made slop videos harder to spot, but experts say it’s still possible to detect them Under the radar Pollution from Colossal looms over a small Southern town, potentially exacerbating health concerns feature Cloudflare was the latest in a string of outages The Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The New York Mets’ ballpark in Queens. A Bronx golf course once operated by President Donald Trump ’s company. A slot parlor on a horse racing track near John F. Kennedy International Airport. The three disparate sites, located far from the tourist hub of Manhattan, will become the future homes of New York City’s first Las Vegas-style resort casinos. The state Gaming Commission on Monday awarded the three projects licenses to operate in the lucrative metropolitan-area market during a meeting at a riverside park in upper Manhattan. The panel approved the licenses with the condition that the companies each appoint an outside monitor that would report regularly to the commission to ensure they meet their financial and legal obligations, as well as the promised investments they made to local communities. Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction.

Title: Amazon sells a free-to-play MOBA it had in development, and the studio making it, to Ubisoft

The sale of March of Giants comes less than two months after Amazon said it had decided to "halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon's slow, shambolic withdrawal from mainstream videogame development continued apace with today's announcement that it has offloaded the free-to-play MOBA March of Giants, which is still in development, onto Ubisoft. The deal will also see Amazon Games Montreal, headed up by former Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis and Ubisoft Toronto managing director Alexandre Parizeau, join Ubisoft as part of its Montreal studio. "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle," said Marquis, the creative director on March of Giants. "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we're excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level." Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot shared similar sentiments, saying that March of Giants "has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas." "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players," Guillemot said. "We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Thrilled to have the March of Giants team join Ubisoft Montréal! These seasoned developers—many who built their careers here—are pushing boundaries with their competitive MOBA experience. Welcome! Full details here: https://t.co/XHree0iuqD pic.twitter.com/qN8HXWsEwnDecember 15, 2025 The MOBA genre can indeed be lucrative, if you happen to be the company that made League of Legends or Dota 2. For everyone else, it's more of a fistfight over the crumbs. Gigantic: Rampage Edition and Seekers of Skyveil both crashed out quickly after launch, and while Smite 2 continues to trundle along, Hi-Rez Studios has struggled badly with layoffs and game shutdowns over the past couple years. The only game with the potential to shake things up in the genre is Deadlock, almost entirely due to the fact it's being developed by Valve. The response to the March of Giants closed alpha in September might suggest that it's in for a similarly rough ride. Not that the reaction is overly negative, there just doesn't seem to be much of it at all: The "closed alpha recap" post, the most recent update, has drawn a total of six comments, and the game's Steam forum in general is largely devoid of activity; the March of Giants Discord seems similarly moribund. How likely it is that Ubisoft will be able to turn that around is anyone's guess, although the odds don't strike me as particularly great. But assuming it follows the LoL/Dota 2 pricing scheme, March of Giants does seem like it could be a good fit for Ubisoft's focus on live service games in the future. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amazon, meanwhile, hasn't completely stepped back from the videogame business. It remains committed to publishing the two new Tomb Raider games announced at The Game Awards 2025, and it also seemingly sees big things in AI-fuelled garbage like Courtroom Chaos Featuring Snoop Dog. This may not be a great time for Ubisoft to try busting into the MOBA biz, but at least it's better than that. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: After "gutting" its video game division, Amazon has sold one of its studios to Ubisoft

March of Giants rights also acquired. Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants. As per Ubisoft's announcement, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis, who joined Amazon in 2021 after leaving Ubisoft two years prior. As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game." "March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on Twitch. Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team." In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease, and word emerged suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned.

By MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot’s primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,” iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn’t expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31.

Title: Tomb Raider Devs Explain Why They’re Making Two Games At Once

Time Published: 2025-12-15T17:10:11Z

Tomb Raider CatalystTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis At last weekâs Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics announced not one, but two Tomb Raider games. One is the next chapter in Lara Croftâs adventures, called Tomb Raider Catalyst; the other is a remake of the original game titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, the same company working on the Sophie Turner-led live-action series. All of this is in an effort to turn Lara into a multimedia superstar with multiple projects running under one roof. With Amazonâs known history of being terrible, fans are probably wondering how deeply its claws are stuck into the Tomb Raider series, and Crystal Dynamics has spoken a little bit about the partnership. In a group Q&A session that Kotaku was present for, Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos and game director Will Kerslake spoke about Amazonâs role in both the upcoming Tomb Raider games and the show. Tomb Raider has been a cross-media franchise for decades, with the Angelina Jolie films being some of the earliest examples of a video game adaptation doing well at the box office, but now Amazon and Crystal Dynamics are trying to make something interconnected, though Crystal Dynamics wouldnât confirm if Catalyst would be tied to the upcoming series when it launches in 2027. âOur Amazon partners have been tremendous,â Amos said. âFrom the beginning, they’ve gotten the idea of this vision we have for this cross-media franchise that crossed both the live-action things during the series and the two games that we’re making right now, but we’re not here to talk about any details and anything else in the future about the TV series until later on.â As far as how deep this partnership goes, Amos said collaborating with Amazonâs own set of creative directors, narrative writers, and producers has been like speaking into a âmirrorâ as the two groups have worked together to pave the way for the future of the series as this multimedia franchise, and that the team is meeting with Amazon folks âdaily,â including on-site visits from Amazon to run through the latest development milestones. âOn the development side, we have partners across all the different disciplines that we work with directly,â Kerslake said. âSo as a member of the dev team, it’s been great to have collaborative partners focused on the quality of the game that trust the team to find the answers to those problems.â By the time Tomb Raider Catalyst launches in 2027, it will have been nine years since the last mainline Tomb Raider game. Shadow of the Tomb Raider launched in 2018 to good but not great reviews, though it did eventually go on to sell over 8.9 million copies. Since then, Tomb Raider has had a lot of re-releases of old games. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is coming out before Catalyst, and this isnât even the first time the original game has been remade, as Tomb Raider: Anniversary also brought that first adventure to modern audiences back in 2007. When asked if Catalyst might be taking longer to come out because Crystal Dynamics is putting more resources into the remake, Amos said “absolutely not,â that the remake had been planned for the franchiseâs 30th anniversary next year and is being handled by a different team than Catalyst. Shadow Warrior developer Flying Wild Hog is working on Legacy of Atlantis, but Amos says the team is still âconnectedâ to Crystal Dynamics and the broader Tomb Raider development team. âWe actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets, but we have one leadership team, a visionary team over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling,â Amos said. Amos said the partnership was made possible by the Fellowship Entertainment subsidiary of the Embracer Group, which is one of the many arms of the company that houses its too-goddamn-many IP like Tomb Raider and Lord of the Rings. Consolidation of media aside, Amos says this partnership has allowed both teams to fully dedicate their time to their respective games in parallel development without siphoning resources from one another. After years of Tomb Raider games looking back at Laraâs survivalist origins, Catalyst is finally moving the timeline forward, though the studio says it has designed Catalyst so players can jump in with “no homework required.” Dragon Age and Assassinâs Creed actor Alix Wilton Regan is voicing the treasure hunter now, and the way Crystal Dynamics describes the game makes it sound like itâs a new era for her and the series, so perhaps a new voice is another sign of that. However, Crystal Dynamics has also made clear that this isnât another reboot or a different timeline. This is the same Lara Croft fans have known and loved for decades, just in a âdifferent timeâ in her life. So perhaps itâs not a bad time to revisit the original game and its more traditional action-adventure roots before finally nudging Lara forward after a decade of survivalist prequels.Â Crystal Dynamics has been put through the wringer over the past few years ever since Square Enix sold it off to Embracer Group, with layoffs happening as recently as last month. Itâs a damn shame those affected workers wonât be around to bring Catalyst past the finish line, but hopefully the end result is able to shine through all that inner turmoil when it launches in 2027.

Title: Reviewing My Wishes for 2026

Time Published: 2025-12-15T16:15:36Z

Here we are at the far end of 2025 and everything is both better and worse than I expected. The Year was 2025… and I was not prepared On the bad side of the ledger… I cannot even start to sum up what a disaster 2025 has been for the US. This is some real “end of the Roman republic” shit and everybody in power is just grabbing stuff for themselves, with naked corruption on display and nobody cares. Absolutely unprecedented criminal activity in plain sight by Republicans, who have decided the law doesn’t apply to them. This stuff only ends in dictatorship and we’re not even going to get an Augustus at this point, having gone straight to Nero with dementia and everybody has to donate to his causes and give him fake awards to in order to conduct business in the US. And it is all going to get worse as he ages and the corruption becomes a huge drag on the economy. Then the AI bubble is going to collapse, and then the real problems will start when CEOs don’t get their bonuses and start laying off even more people. So there is all that. On the bright side, personally, I still have a job, healthcare, and a home. We’re not struggling. Day to day things are still “normal.” Granted, we’re not buying anything either as the price of everything, from beef to blueberries, is going up and dinner for two at even a modest restaurant goes past $100 if we order a cocktail. But that Costco whole roasted chicken is still a deal. Anyway, I knew it was going to be bad so rather than doing predictions at the start of the year, I altered my annual tradition, wherein I feel obligated to foresee how things might go bad, and chose to go with a hopeful set of wishes. For those interested in the history of this routine, I have links! Of course I do! Now here we are in the back half of the last month of the year and it is time to do the accounting, to credit the universe for the wishes it granted and grumble about those it denied. For purposes of measurement, wishes have the usual 10 point value, with partial credit available for partial fulfillment, unless otherwise indicated in the wish. Are we ready? Let’s do this. 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Hah hah hah… no. Phil Spencer won’t be sufficiently motivated unless he gets an obscene bonus, which meant laying people off at XBox and elsewhere. I don’t know what he’ll do when he runs out of staff to lay off, but we’re getting closer to finding out. Zero points. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. Hah hah hah… no. In fact, things seems to be going in the opposite direction for Daybreak and EG7. Capital management firms want more stock buybacks and more dividend payments. There will be no investment in the future. Zero points. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. Okay, this was a gimme for 2025. I am not so sure it will be for 2026 though. 10 points. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. I didn’t even believe this back in January, so no surprises here with zero points. It is only disappointing because ArenaNet managed to do something for original Guild Wars. Hell, they added controller support. 5 – Commit To or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Again, wish denied. EG7 keeps hyping H1Z1 as an important first party title in its financials, but has done nothing with it. Zero points. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. I mean, we are technically getting housing in 2025. It showed up last week. But I couldn’t tell you if they messed it up. The previews got some shade from people with no investment in the game while the current fan boys have declared it to be everything anybody could ever want plus a bag of chips. Still, if the fans aren’t revolting, Works for the true believers even if the non-invested seem less than impressed, so I guess they didn’t mess up completely. Give me… erm, the universe… 6 points on this one while the jury is still out in the long term. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace Hah hah hah… no. Blizz seems to be actively sabotaging WoW Classic at this point. Expansions running way too long, modern features being shoehorned into old content, and the heavy hands of monetization are all weighing on the experience. I am expecting somebody in Blizz leadership to revive the J. Allen Brack quote about thinking you want classic and declare that he was right all along… or announce a new version of vanilla with Dungeon Finder, achievements, WoW Tokens, and a cash shop. Anyway, zero points here. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new Fuck no. That might impact Phil Spencer’s bonus. And I thought Bobby Kotick was bad, but he at least found space in the budget for some new titles. Zero points. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access Nope. Still three devs in a yurt grinding out code on stone tablets. Zero points. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access Now I am just going start getting angry. This isn’t even a real project. Zero points, though I feel like it should get negative points for being such a psych. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on Sure, at least Sean Murray and crew are still working on that. Corvettes were awesome. 10 points. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles Not really. It will be a few years before it is playable and they figure out people don’t like to be ganked by ornothoptors or whatever all day long. Still, it runs. Maybe 4 points. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving It seemed to do well for most of the year. Then Amazon decided to stop supporting third party platforms to favor their own Luna AI offerings. Still, for most of the year GoG.com was doing well. Call it 8 points. 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy No. They either don’t know or cannot admit as much. Things are “better” but how much was them just cranking the dials at random until some metric went up? The price of PLEX is down 25% since its 2025 peak. Good for buyers, but bad for sellers. I’ll give the universe 4 points for at least the Mineral Price Index going down finally, though does that mean they fixed something or that there is some other problem? 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Nope. Zero points. Next. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title Hah hah hah… no. They either want a late 90s FPS or a blockchain scam title. Nothing people will pay to play for fun. Zero points. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Wasted a wish on that as well. Zero points. 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done I should just lay off New Eden. Burnout and ill health has put a damper on progress. Zero points. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Mein Gott, enough already. I mean, we did get a few minutes of war. PanFam did occasionally fight back as we rolled east and up to their boarder… then the core of the coalition, Pandemic Horde, collapsed and ran away and eventually folded into The Initiative, so we spent a few weeks blowing up structures unopposed, random hero structure gunners not forgotten. While that is an element of many wars in New Eden, that wasn’t the was we wanted. Call it 3 points, one for each Keepstar they at least tried to defend. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News Yeah no… the money was on the original Guild Wars being remastered I guess. Who knew? Zero points. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll Yes, this seems to be going well. It is a little rough at every major update, but it gets worked out, and there is a 1.0 target for next spring. 10 points. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach I want to be charitable and say yes, it did expand. But it still feels years away from any vision Raph was spinning back when he was going on about design pillars. I am sure the underlying code has improved, but the actual play tests feel like they did a year back, just with more restrictions. My fault for having expectations and expecting more from the universe when it grants wishes. Call it 5 points. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 Do I get triple points because it went to level 80? I am going to dissect the essence of this wish, which was for a 10 level raise in the level cap. And, sure enough, everybody who was level 50 went straight to level 70, leaving them 10 more levels to work on. It kind of worked out if you squint at it real hard. I am claiming 10 points for the universe on this one. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake Nope. Zero points. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. The cut off date for wishes is December 15. Zero points. Hardly a surprise this failed to pan out given the Mark Jacobs track record for the last 20 years. 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck It became a live service, game pass, drip updates, buy the new shiny of the month style of game to rival even the most annoying Paradox title. It made a splash for a month or two then disappeared from sight. 2 points for the effort. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Hah, no! Zero points. See you next year! 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Nope, Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down revealed instead. Zero points. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominated and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real What was I even thinking? Gabe isn’t buying mega yachts off of developing games, just on taxing developers selling games on his platform. This guy might be the least worst rich gaming CEO or executive, and he is still fucking miserable. Half Life 3 will never happen. Zero points. But what if he is just holding it back as a launch title for the GabeCube? Better draft it in FCL again this year, just in case! Summing Up So, if all wishes had been granted, it would have been worth 300 points, there being 30 wishes and 10 points a piece. Unless my ability to count is seriously impaired, three passes down the list all came up with 82 points scored. That gives the universe about a 27% wish fulfillment rate, counting partials. The universe is about on par with my average year’s ability to guess. So it goes. This was my 18th round of guesses over the life of the blog. Time to get ready for the 19th. For 2026 it will be all predictions. Then maybe I for the 20th can sum up how well I have done over the years in total, maybe pulling out my most unlikely guesses that came true… though that sounds like work. We’ll see. Anyway, look for the next round showing up at a January 1st 2026 near you! Gaming (or maybe just my relationship with it) was weird this year. On the one hand, I played a ton of games I really enjoyed, so I can’t fairly say it was a ‘bad’ year. On the other hand, I played mostly the same games this year that I did last year (League of Legends, TableTopSim for 40k, Rimworld), with some ‘new’ games like FFT:remaster in the mix. The list of truly new games released that I thought were awesome? Pretty short. LikeLike For the record, I think a better bet next year would be that Microsoft would pawn XBox off to some Private Equity Firm ™, which means that all of those game studios will implode within 4-5 years. Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and WoW won’t save Bethesda and Blizzard from a potential bad end, since the PE Firm will only want Call of Duty and mobile games. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. Would Clair Obscure count as well? LikeLike Oh, but why sell it off when you could force AI into everything to help justify setting billions of dollars on fire on that front? Plenty of options on the table. And yes, I CO33 would count as well. I wrote most of this before the game awards so that wasn’t front and center in my mind having won all the awards. LikeLike I know it’s after the cut-off, but apparently LOTRO just announced that UI scaling is coming with its next patch. (Saw someone posting about it on Bluesky.) LikeLike I’ll be interested to see what they have. They acknowledged scaling as an issue back in 2016 and have talked about it off and on, but they have not delivered much on that front. LikeLike Regarding #12 – I can‘t comment on anything Conan Exiles related as I haven‘t played that, but Dune is very much „playable“ right now. Even if you‘re a lot quicker than I was to reach the deep desert you‘ll still have at least 50 hours of well designed, awesome (in my opinion, obviously) content ahead of you until there‘s even a chance of running into any griefing-related problems. Personally, I got over 200 very enjoyable hours out of the game. No sign of griefing during any of them, btw. LikeLike I will admit that I only read the patch notes at this point, and they read a lot like early Conan Exiles update, which at least confirmed my “they never learn” take. I plan to play at some point, but the group is currently off on another side adventure. LikeLike Whatever LoTRO has coming it’s already on the test server. According to Reddit, it works pretty well. That will teach you to give up on your wishes too soon! Maybe the game industry will correct itself and start treating their employees well in the next two weeks ;-) LikeLiked by 1 person Hey man, the rule is always December 15th or bust.

Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn't expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot's primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners," iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn't expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events
