On Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June. The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it is promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould. The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Steam on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a $39.99 USD Standard Edition, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a $74.99 Classic Edition that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game. If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a $199.99 Tail Time Edition, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please. Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which announced layoffs earlier this year - is assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot, and continuing work on an untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped.

Title: Slog AM: Cops Who Killed Tyre Nichols Walk Free, Gates Foundation Plans to Close, Ferguson Signs Rent Cap

Weather: Today will be mostly sunny with a high of 63 degrees. Enjoy it while it lasts, because the rain’s just backstage, doing vocal warm-ups for its big return in the next few days. Gates Foundation Calls It Quits: Mark your calendars for December 31, 2045. That’s when the Gates Foundation will be shutting its doors for good. Since 2000, they’ve thrown over $100 billion at public health and claimed to have cut worldwide childhood deaths in half, because nothing says progress like fixing problems with the same obscene wealth that helped create them. Bill Gates, in full humblebrag mode, told the New York Times, “We went from 10 million childhood deaths to five million,” and insists they’ll keep shrinking that number because apparently, “the Golden Rule was not repealed.” In the next 20 years, he plans to spend down the entire endowment of the foundation, and much of his personal wealth, he told the Times. Nothing says do unto others like hoarding enough cash to play God for a couple more decades before peacing out. Ferguson Signs Rent Cap: Well, lookie there, Governor Bob Ferguson can do something remotely progressive. Yesterday he signed a law capping rent hikes at 10% a year for most tenants, making Washington the third state to put rent stabilization on the books after Oregon and California. So now, landlords can only jack up rents by 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. New buildings (12 years old and younger) and certain owner-occupied properties are exempt. Most folks are celebrating because, hello, no more outrageous rent hikes, but others, like the landlord advocacy group Rental Housing Association, are freaking out, claiming it’ll kill the housing market. Right… Bottom line: it’s a win for renters, but we’re just scratching the surface of the housing crisis. Judge Says No to Libya Deportations: The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya—yes, Libya, the place that happens to have a Level 4 travel advisory for crime, terrorism, and armed conflict—using US military planes to ship people off like Amazon Prime for human suffering. Fortunately, a federal judge quickly reminded Terror 47 that shipping human beings off to a war zone without notice or a chance to contest it blatantly violates his order, but hey, when has the law ever slowed down the empire? Judge Brian Murphy, who had already blocked the administration from deporting people to countries other than their own, made it clear: “The Court sees none,” when it comes to any doubt that these deportations would break the law. Meanwhile, Libya itself is saying, “We never agreed to this,” but since when has consent ever mattered to Trump? Cops Who Killed Tyre Nichols Walk Free: Three former Memphis cops—Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith—just walked free on all state charges, including second-degree murder, for the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols. Now, let’s get this straight: they were convicted of witness tampering in federal court but somehow (mostly) skated on civil rights violations—because apparently, beating a man to death just isn’t quite enough evidence. Civil rights lawyers called it, “a devastating miscarriage of justice,” which is the polite way of saying, “What in the actual fuck?” Meanwhile, the DOJ found out Memphis cops have basically been running their own Fight Club with a badge—so maybe, just maybe, it’s time we stop acting shocked when the system does exactly what it was designed to do. We Got A New Pope: It’s official. This morning, white smoke billowed from the Vatican chimney, meaning we officially have a new pope. Behind locked doors, a conclave of 133 cardinals decided which one of them is holiest, like a cosmic game of Catholic bingo. Any minute now, he'll step onto that balcony, wave to the masses, and remind us that God is watching...but apparently only through their eyes. Stagflation Nation: The Fed just rang the stagflation alarm as the U.S. economy sags under Trump. Inflation’s creeping up, jobs are shaky, and the culprit—surprise!—is “volatile trade activity,” a.k.a. Trump’s tariff chaos. In a flailing attempt at distraction, Trump is hyping a sad little trade deal with the UK, while U.S. trade officials lean on countries battered by those same tariffs to make room for Starlink internet service, sold by Nazi-loving absent-daddy Elon Musk. DOGE Wants Your Data: In more Musk news, what could go wrong with a massive, centralized government database run by the Nazi-saluter? According to the Washington Post, Musk’s little doges are quietly hoarding personal information on Americans. Civil rights advocates and some federal employeees are are warning this isn't just hacker bait — it’s a handy little tool for targeting political enemies or screwing with access to public services. Columbia University Crackdown: On Tuesday night, more than 100 students at Columbia University occupied Butler Library, renaming it the Basel Al-Araj Popular University in honor of the slain Palestinian intellectual. Their demand: that Columbia divest from Israeli apartheid and genocide. The response: riot cops and repression. According to NBC News, NYPD and Columbia security trapped protesters inside the building and refused to let them leave unless they handed over their IDs. Protesters reportedly laughed at the demand. At least 78 people were detained. “We refuse to go down quietly,” said the students in a post-raid statement. UW Suspends 21 Students: The Columbia crackdown comes just as the University of Washington suspended 21 students accused of occupying a new engineering building in protest of the school’s partnership with Boeing, a company whose weapons have been used in Israel’s assault on Gaza. Police arrested at least 31 people during that occupation, with the university claiming "significant damage" to equipment—though no full estimate has been released. Some students are now banned from all UW campuses. Student group SUPER UW said in the social media statement that many students sustained injuries from the SPD, “some to the extent of hospitalization.” Adios High-Capacity Magazines: The Washington State Supreme Court just upheld the state’s ban on high-capacity magazines, shrugging off a lower court’s gripe that it was unconstitutional. In a 7-2 decision, the justices declared that magazines packing more than 10 rounds aren’t “arms” protected by state or federal constitutions, meaning the 2022 law stands—no buying or selling these ammo hogs in Washington, though you can still hang on to the ones you’ve got. Justice Charles Johnson wrote that high-capacity mags aren’t crucial for self-defense and Gov. Ferguson pointed out their outsized role in mass shootings and insisted that sensible gun laws don’t trample your right to pack heat. Maybe if you need 30 rounds to feel safe, the problem isn’t the magazine—it’s you. Medicaid Cuts Threaten Care Facilities: Trump’s cutting Medicaid, and guess what? Long-term care facilities in Washington, like Edmonds Care, might close, leaving millions of elderly and disabled folks out in the cold. A simple 5% cut would force massive layoffs and could shut down 65% of these places—people would have nowhere to go. And with the number of seniors needing care on the rise, this isn’t just bad, it’s a crisis. If you care about your fellow humans, maybe pick up the phone and tell your reps to stop treating human lives like they’re the damn Squid Game. From Real Housewives to Holocaust Memorial: So, Trump decided to swap out Biden’s picks for the Holocaust Memorial Council with his usual lineup of sycophants, including—wait for it—Real Housewives of New Jersey star Siggy Flicker. Yes, you heard that right. The same Siggy whose stepson was arrested for storming the Capitol on January 6th is now in charge of overseeing a museum dedicated to one of the darkest periods in human history. If you watched her on TV, you know she probably believes “Never Forget” is a trending hashtag, not a solemn mission. Behold, LimeGliders: Seattle is now the first city to roll out LimeGliders—scooters that look like bikes, because why not make transportation even more confusing? Lime’s betting big on the Emerald City to test out their latest and greatest, using our city’s hills, rain, and general weather chaos as the ultimate proving ground. So now you’ve got 3,000 of these LimeGliders on the streets, alongside e-bikes and stand-up scooters, all while we’re trying to stay at the top of the micromobility game. Just don’t forget your helmet, because when you inevitably eat it, at least you’ll have some protection while questioning your life choices! Next Step in Council Ethics Changes: Later today, the City Council’s Governance, Accountability & Economic Development Committee will be deliberating on whether to ditch the whole “recuse yourself if you’ve got skin in the game” rule. You know, that pesky ethics thing that says if you might make a few bucks off a vote, maybe don’t vote on it? Instead, they want council members to just disclose their conflicts and keep right on voting. It basically amounts to, “Yeah, I might get rich off this, but at least I told you first!” If you’re downtown today at 2 PM, maybe swing by City Hall, grab the mic during public comment, and remind them that ethics aren’t just vibes—they’re rules for a reason. Should the proposal pass out of committee, it could head to a full council vote as early as May 20. Yes, as I mentioned to kick off Slog AM, the sun is shining today, so it might feel a little odd to suggest a morning sing-along to "Can You Stand the Rain." But damn it, it’s R&B singer Desmon Dennis’ birthday, so shout out to him and his soulful cover of New Edition’s ultimate slow jam.

Title: Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in a core business unit

More Google workers are leaving When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google has revealed yet another headcount reduction affecting around 200 workers in its global business unit (via Reuters). The workers come from a department responsible for sales and partnerships, with the redundancies part of a broader cost-cutting move with Google shifting its focus to data centers and AI – a true sign of the times. In a statement, Google said the changes would "drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve our customers." It is the latest in a series of announcements of job cuts at Google, after the company recently laid off several hundred workers across its Pixel and Android departments, with its HR department also affected earlier in February 2025. Still, that's not a patch on Google's widespread layoffs in January 2023, when 12,000 workers were sent home – about 6% of its global workforce. As of December 2024, Google had just over 183,000 workers, so while the reduction of 200 global business unit workers isn't significant in terms of percentage, it's still very much an unwelcome decision for all of those affected. Google isn't the only company making regular minor adjustments, either. Meta recently laid off around 100 employees in its reality labs unit, and a considerable 3,600 (5%) earlier in February when CEO Mark Zuckerberg told workers to prepare for an "intense year."

Title: Southern California’s Industrial Warehouse Market Plays an Anxious Waiting Game
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/05/california-ports-industrial-tariffs-port/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T10:00:05Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy In 2024, the bustling Port of Los Angeles processed 10.2 million shipping containers, the boat-born boxes that carry the goods of global trade. Measured via a stat called TEUs, the annual haul was the second-most in the port’s history and a 20 percent jump from the year before. This May, port watchers expect the harbor to be relatively quiet, as President Donald Trump’s tariffs — now 145 percent on Chinese goods — tank shipping volumes. The last cargo vessels from China that set sail before Trump began ramping up tariffs in early February have already docked, signaling the steep dropoff expected in trans-Pacific cargo. Port of L.A. Director Gene Seroka expects the number of ships to drop by 25 percent, with overall trade volume falling by a third. A report by Apollo Global Management suggests the levies will lead to empty store shelves, spur layoffs in the trucking and retail sector, and precipitate a recession in just a few months. The entire U.S. economy and supply chain has tried to adjust and brace for the impacts of the tariffs, and that includes Southern California’s industrial warehouses. The impacts on those will depend on factors such as tenant base and the duration of any higher tariffs. Few sectors remain as closely tied to the comings and goings of California’s ports than those warehouses. Roughly 13 percent of the GDP of the Greater L.A. region and $93.3 billion in tax revenue depends on shipping and logistics, according to a presentation by Stephen Cheung, president and CEO of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. More than 2,000 foreign-owned firms in this industry operate, and rent storage space, in and around the global commerce hub. Saying the region’s roughly 2 billion square feet of industrial real estate might be impacted is an understatement. Disrupting the trade on which warehouse construction and operation hinge could have a critical and long-term impact on the region’s economy. The day after the April 2 tariff announcements, warehouse giant Prologis’ share price dropped 9.6 percent. “This is like the Dodgers winning the World Series last year, and then just trading all their players and saying, ‘We’ll figure something out when the draft comes along,’” said former California Gov. Gray Davis on the logic of tariffs during the LAEDC call about the port slowdown. The owners and operators of industrial real estate in Southern California, while certainly anxious about the impact, haven’t hit the panic button yet, despite the prediction that port real estate will be particularly hard hit. Part of the reason is the diversity within the sector and SoCal itself. About 75 percent of logistics real estate demand in Southern California is tied to local and regional distribution, according to Prologis research. Authors of the Prologis report believe this “blend of uses — serving both import flows and end consumption — will help insulate the region’s logistics real estate from sharp swings in trade activity.” But, as tenants feel out tariff impacts and rework their real estate strategies, the entire sector — massive retail warehouses in the Inland Empire, port-adjacent property, and small last-mile delivery centers — still grapples with uncertainty. Jeff Jennison, president and CEO of Watson Land Company, told reporters that he’s seen South Bay industrial users, all solid credit tenants, hit pause starting in late April. “Decisions have stopped,” Jennison said, with meaningful expenditures delayed. “Most folks will delay any major decision-making if possible,” said David Fan, JLL’s Southern California senior research director. “A lot of major capital decisions, such as moving out or constructing a new facility, are wait and see.” The length of the tariffs, and whether they prove to be cudgels for trade deals, will impact different parts of the warehouse world differently. As Fan noted, large big-box retailers like Walmart have incredibly complex and detailed logistics operations. If the current scenario drags on — and it was dragging as Commercial Observer went to press — these retailers will be more apt to quickly reduce their footprint. Part of the response depends on how tariffs impact consumer spending and consumption. March data, Fan noted, showed an uptick, in part due to shoppers stocking up. A quick end to these charges, and trade deals that lock in certainty, could lead to soaring stocks, renewed spending, and a bullwhip effect where demand for warehouse space surges. “If you’re looking for big-box space that lends itself to 3PL, especially China, that’s going to be a tough go,” said Brett Turner, senior managing director of acquisitions and dispositions for BKM Capital Partners, which operates a portfolio of small-bay spaces. (3PL is the industry shorthand for third-party logistics.) “If you’re smaller, and your space lends itself to American manufacturing, I think you’re going to be in a really, really good spot.” Preparation also helps, and the warehouse industry has been bracing for impact for months. Chinese 3PL providers like Alibaba and JD.Com went on a leasing spree in anticipation of supply chain challenges. Such providers made up more than half of leasing activity in Los Angeles and the Inland Empire during the second half of 2024, and fully 80 percent in the fourth quarter alone. Coming after the regional warehouse industry had overbuilt and started to see the kind of depressed rents and slowdowns that signaled a (relative) space glut in 2023 — average vacancy was 2.7 percent in 2023, about half the 5.1 percent seen this year — this overzealous planning helped normalize the market, slashing vacancy and restoring supply-demand balance. The leasing activity during the first three months of 2025, 13.9 million square feet according to CBRE, was 62.5 percent higher than the same period last year and 20.7 percent over last year’s quarterly average. Coming after the COVID supply chain crises, which led to a shift toward stockpiling and safer supply chains — less just-in-time and more just-in-case — makes the industry more prepared. “COVID made these businesses realize that customer acquisition cost is hugely important, and if you screw up your supply chain and can’t deliver product to your customers, it’s going to cost you a lot of money,” BKM’s Turner said. “I think we’re pretty well prepared to go through this. I don’t know that it’s the best policy, and you can argue that all day, but if there’s a time that America can deal with it from an industrial supply standpoint, it’s now.” Fan also tracked end-of-year expansion from blue-chip clients and American retail firms, many of which felt bullish on the tax cuts and fiscal stimulus they expected from the then-incoming Trump administration. On its recent earnings calls, Prologis noted that companies like Amazon, Home Depot and FedEx have in recent months all been rushing in goods and seeking out overflow space. Deferred tenant decisions, in the short term, will impact net absorption rate in Q2 and beyond, predicted John Nahas, managing director of L.A.-based Rexford Industrial, which operates a 51 million-square-foot portfolio of smaller spaces in the region. He doesn’t see tariffs totally stalling the market — Rexford itself saw more absorption in Q1 than during the back half of last year — but the impact remains unpredictable. Tenants who have worked hard to establish supply chains won’t just jump out of leases, said Nahas, because there’s no tariff clause. His firm has roughly 11.2 percent of its portfolio subject to renewals in 2025, and he’s not alarmed. At the same time, many of the bigger tenants and big-box players will be attuned to the way tariffs hit American consumers. JLL’s Fan called the sector a sensitive barometer of economic activity, with retailers sure to rapidly adjust inventory and warehouse utilization. Right now, rents are declining, vacancies are increasing, and 6.6 million square feet of warehouses remain under construction in the Greater Los Angeles area, so significant shifts would ripple throughout the industry. “There’s been a higher percentage of economists saying there’s a higher chance of recession, and most of our markets are geared toward consumption rather than manufacturing,” he said. “To that extent, we will be impacted.” Fan said he’s keeping his eyes on the Chinese 3PL leases, which now lease about 4 percent of the total SoCal market. Since American consumers spend so much more than their overseas counterparts, Chinese firms are keen to establish more trade here, and have signed long-term leases during their recent attempt to shore up space. If tariffs last long enough for them to run through their pre-positioned inventory, their next moves will have a big impact. The fundamentals of the market could carry the sector through a sure-to-be unsteady year, Fan said. And the long-term push toward logistics efficiency will hopefully lead firms to make investments to optimize their delivery strategy — Amazon just announced a potential $15 billion nationwide investment in new facilities, for instance. Hopefully, faster, better and cheaper still matter. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Big Tech's new playbook: Trim the fat; pay the stars
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-giants-overhaul-pay-rewarding-stars-scrutinizing-underachievers-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-08T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Big Tech is rewriting the rules this year: Top talent gets big rewards, while underperformers face the heat. The latest to follow suit is Amazon, which recently overhauled its compensation model to reward long-running top performers with larger payouts. Four years at the highest performance rank now pays off big with 110% of the pay band, which exceeds the previous 100% cap. But employees who achieve the top rank for the first time take a hit, with total comp cut to 70% of the pay range, down from last year's 80%. The move is part of a broader tech trend of using performance reviews and compensation to better incentivize high achievers and eliminate underperformers and their drag on the balance book. Big Tech firms, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have made similar changes, all in pursuit of leaner, top-tier teams. These companies handed out lavish perks, pampering, and sky-high salaries to stay competitive. A pandemic-era hiring spree exacerbated a tech tradition of hoarding top talent and only added to the ranks. Now, a shift makes one thing clear: It's no longer about head count — it's about talent. The changes go hand in hand with sweeping pivots across tech to replace perks and pampering with performance and efficiency. Big Tech still rewards workers handsomely, but the era of resting and vesting at the giants may be well and truly over. "The industry overall has made big efforts to do more with less," Brian Nguyen, a product manager at the salary data platform Levels.fyi, told Business Insider. "This has allowed them to scale back costs while pushing for higher-quality work with fewer employees and rewards for only the top-tier performers." Google declined to comment, and Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI about its low-performer cuts: "Employees at Meta have always been held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance." The new approach "creates a steadier compensation progression for employees as they develop within their roles," an Amazon spokesperson said, adding the company offers "multiple channels" for employees to raise concerns about pay. Amazon managers this year received a list of potential pay-related questions and suggested answers, according to internal talking points obtained by BI. If asked about pay cuts, managers are encouraged to focus on employees getting raises for improved performance. "Employees moving to a higher OV level will generally receive an increase," one talking point said, referring to Amazon's performance rating called overall value. "This ensures an appropriate distinction between newer and consistently high-performing employees at each OV level." At Google, a larger share of employees can now earn top performance ratings, which lead to bigger bonuses and equity. Managers have also been given the authority to hand out more discretionary rewards to employees who are excelling. But with a fixed budget, those gains come at the cost of lower-ranked employees, reinforcing the company's focus on high performance and raising the stakes for those falling behind. "High performance is more important than ever to achieve the goals we've set, and so we're making some changes to further reward top contributors," John Casey, Google's vice president of global compensation and benefits, told staff in a memo last week. Microsoft, meanwhile, has rolled out policies aimed at enhancing performance management and addressing what the company calls "low performers." Managers also received "more transparency and clarity" in the rewards process, an internal note seen by BI said. The change came after the company laid off 2,000 employees deemed to be underperforming earlier this year. Meta has ramped up what it calls performance-based cuts, aiming to shed about 5% of its lowest-rated staff. An internal memo revealed plans to make these layoffs annual under a "non-regrettable attrition" policy. Adding to the sting, some ex-employees — even high performers — have landed on internal block lists, barring them from being rehired. While these companies are weighing an employee's performance rating history more heavily, some are also reducing new-hire offers. In 2022, Amazon regularly offered over $300,000 a year to newly hired midlevel software engineers, according to data from Levels.fyi. Nowadays, more offers land around $270,000 a year, with recruiters being especially strict about needing "extra approvals" for anything higher, said Levels.fyi's Nguyen. Other companies, like Meta and Apple, are taking a similar approach, he added. Switching jobs no longer helps either. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker shows that median pay increases for job switchers dropped to 4.2% in February, down sharply from 7.3% in early 2023. Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the heat with lower pay offers and significant pay cuts, BI previously reported, as reduced competition has weakened employees' bargaining power. Not everyone is sold that the shift to crack down on underperformance is here to stay. Peter Capelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told BI that many companies follow these trends simply because "others are doing them," cycling through similar changes every decade or so. "These are just fads," Capelli said. Still, the changes haven't gone unnoticed. At one Amazon office, some employees quietly voiced their frustration on an elevator whiteboard, a photo of which was shared with BI. "No raise, no RSUs — thanks!" the whiteboard read, referring to the lack of employee stock awards. "Do more with less." Have a tip?

Title: Google layoffs: 200 sales, partnerships jobs cut as money flows to AI and data centres, says report

Google on May 6 laid off at least 200 people in sales and partnerships roles across its global business unit, according to a report by The Information, citing sources. The report was also carried by Reuters, who in a statement from the company reported that Google is “making small number of changes across teams”, which are aimed at increased collaboration and customer service. Notably, Silicon Valley tech giants are increasingly prioritising development of artificial intelligence (AI) and allocation for data centres that run their AI tools, while scaling back on other investments, the Reuters report added. Last month, on April 10, Google laid off hundreds of employees working in its platforms and devices division, which includes work on Android OS, Chrome browser, and Pixel phones, sources told The Information. On April 15, Business Standard reported that these jobs included some roles at Google's Bengaluru and Hyderabad offices. The sources cited in the report also claimed that Google plans to cut jobs in India across advertisement, marketing and sales. In a statement to The Information, a Google spokesperson said: “Since combining the Platforms and Devices teams last year, we’ve focused on becoming more nimble and operating more effectively and this included making some job reductions in addition to the voluntary exit program that we offered in January.” Since January 2023, Google has laid off at least 12,000 employees, or 6 per cent of its global workforce. This was announced by parent company Alphabet. As of December 2024, the tech giant had 1,83.323 employees, the report said. Alphabet is not alone. In January 2025, Mark Zuckerberg-led Facebook parent company Meta Platforms cut 5 per cent employees, it said were the “lowest performers”, it added. The company also announced increased hiring of machine learning engineers.

Key points: Supply chain expert warns of "asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs" disruption as U.S.-China trade war escalates Chinese imports to US expected to plunge 80%, triggering historic shortages, price spikes, and mass layoffs Trump's 25% auto parts tariffs deepen crisis as experts warn: "Even if a deal happens, recovery could take a year" Southern California's port-dependent economy faces devastation, with "one in five jobs" at risk The U.S. and much of the industrialized world are now entrenched in a historic trade war â a conflict intensified by President Donald Trumpâs policies but ultimately inevitable due to past U.S. administrations losing key negotiations with other nations. These earlier failures set the stage for economic decline, as businesses shuttered and corporations relocated overseas in search of more favorable conditions. Now, in a desperate bid for survival, the U.S. government is waging high-stakes trade battles, deploying aggressive tariffs to pressure other nations into compliance. This strategy underscores the dollarâs weakening dominance and the decline of American manufacturing, as countries increasingly abandon reliance on the worldâs reserve currency to forge their own economic alliances. The coming supply chain apocalypse The warning signs are already flashing red. Container shipments from China to the U.S. have plummeted 60% since April, with major retailers now burning through stockpiled inventory. Once those reserves vanish â likely within weeks â Americans will face barren shelves, rationing, and hyperinflation on everyday goods. Smaller businesses, already struggling, are the canaries in the coal mine. The crisis is exacerbated by decades of U.S, economic malpractice, where corrupt administrations outsourced critical manufacturing to China, leaving the nation defenseless. Now, as Trumpâs tariffs sever trade ties, thereâs no quick fix. "It takes years to build new factories," notes one analyst. "How do we replace $438 billion in Chinese imports?" The answer: We canât. Economic carnage and the betrayal of American workers Southern Californiaâs ports â the lifeline of U.S. commerce â are ground zero for the coming disaster. Gary Herrera of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union warns that "one in every five jobs" in the region is tied to port activity, with ripple effects crushing warehouse workers, truckers, and rail operators. The Inland Empire, a hub for Walmart and Amazon, faces economic ruin. Even if Trump secures a deal tomorrow, supply chains wonât recover for 9â12 months, says Altana Technologies CEO Evan Smith. But China refuses to negotiate under coercion, and Trumpâs latest tariffs â like the auto parts levy â signal no retreat. "The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system," Smith adds, "and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain." A nation on the brink: Prepare now or suffer later This is not a drill. The global trade war has arrived, and its consequences will dwarf the COVID-era disruptions. The Federal Reserveâs reckless money-printing has already devalued the dollar, and now, supply chain chaos will ignite inflation like a powder keg. Those who fail to prepare â stockpiling essentials, securing alternative income, or converting savings to gold â will be left at the mercy of a collapsing system. As the radical left fuels unrest and the deep state plots its next move, one truth is undeniable: The America we knew is gone. Will this crisis finally awaken the public to the corruption that brought us here â or will they keep rioting, looting, and begging for government handouts as the shelves go bare? Additional Reading: Why the Trump administration will FAIL, and Americaâs economy, military and industrial base will COLLAPSE if Trumpâs weaponized tariffs arenât halted.

Title: The Art of the Price Hike

Trump’s tariff plan has pushed America’s businesses into a nightmarish experiment. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Maxwell Cohen knew the tariffs were coming. President Donald Trump had openly threatened a trade war on the campaign trail, and Cohen, an entrepreneur, heeded his words. His company, Peelaways, sells disposable and waterproof fitted bed sheets made in China that are popular with at-home and family caregivers. There’s only so much price elasticity for disposable goods, so he prepared to absorb what he estimated would be roughly 15 to 30 percent tariffs, setting aside money to bring in more inventory before prices skyrocketed. It would hurt, but it would be doable. He thought he had the numbers mostly worked out. But when man plans, Trump laughs. The latest figure for the administration’s tariffs on China sits at 145 percent. Prices are expected to keep climbing for some goods; last week, Trump closed the de minimis loophole for China and Hong Kong, which had exempted them from paying tariffs on shipments of goods worth $800 or less, and wide-ranging tariffs are still set to go into effect for many countries. For any business that can’t swallow an unanticipated and possibly huge price increase on imports, the first step is deciding if it will pass the cost to the consumer. If the answer is yes—as it often is—the next decision is how, or whether, to let the customers know. Tariff transparency recently made headlines on the domestic front of Trump’s trade war. After Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was considering adding a line showing the cost of tariffs for each product on its site, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt held a public shaming of the company from her briefing-room podium, calling the move “a hostile and political act.” CNN reported that a “pissed” Trump called Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder. The company’s representatives soon denied ever approving the idea, adding that it was never a consideration for Amazon’s main site but rather for its spin-off store, Haul. Although big, name-brand American companies are most likely to incur the administration’s wrath over displaying tariff surcharges, other businesses have tough choices to make on how to go about raising prices. The result is a choose-your-own-adventure exercise in managing public perception. Screenshots of the checkout page of the online clothing company Triangl went viral for the astronomical “duties” surcharge. Temu, a Chinese e-commerce giant, added import charges to certain products on its site. Luxury brands aren’t immune, either: Hermès announced price increases for American buyers to offset the tariffs, and Prada plans to raise prices by an undetermined amount later in the summer. Meanwhile, some business leaders aren’t mincing words. Jolie Skin Co, an American shower-filter brand, told The Information that a “Trump liberation tariff” line will be added to checkout pages. “Technically WE are not raising our prices,” the company’s CEO and founder, Ryan Babenzien, wrote on LinkedIn. “We think transparency is the way to go here and I am giving Trump full credit for his decision.” Transparency is a high-wire act. Tariffs is such a politically loaded word that some companies hesitate to invoke it, out of fear of alienating their customer base—or inciting the administration’s ire. But pointing a finger at tariffs can also help shift blame. Increasing prices without any clear explanation risks appearing opportunistic, Mike Michalowicz, a small-business expert, told me. All it takes is for some businesses to get caught profiteering before “the customer becomes suspect of not just them but of everybody.” The gaming industry is a prime example. Nintendo has a large manufacturing presence in China, and last month, it announced that the Switch 2 console would launch at the original price, but some of the accessories will cost more than previously expected. The company’s representatives attributed the update to “changes in market conditions.” If that phrase sounds familiar, it’s almost word for word the explanation Microsoft offered after announcing Xbox price hikes last week, which will run as high as $100 more for some models in America. The absence of the T-word is a glaring omission. Such muddy messaging may help insulate companies from the administration’s spite, but it invites backlash from customers who are quick to blame the good old-fashioned motive of corporate greed. If some companies fear appearing opportunistic, others are trying to cash in while they still can. Marketing 101 teaches you to distinguish your company from your competitors, and Business 101 says to move inventory before the economy goes kaput. What better way to do both than to slash prices when everybody else is raising them? “Pre-tariff” sales are cropping up at furniture companies, fashion retailers, and carmakers. Their underlying message: Get it before you can’t afford it. Ford’s latest campaign, “From America. For America,” is trying to strike an optimistic tone. As Audi pauses car imports to the United States, and automakers hem and haw over price changes, Ford has been running an ad since last month touting employee-priced vehicles and their company’s deep roots in American industry. It’s a strategic ploy—already, Ford has reported double-digit sales increases (although an analysis from CarEdge found that some of Ford’s more popular vehicles had better deals in March, before employee pricing went into effect). Other carmakers that manufacture models in America, including Mercedes and BMW, are promising to temporarily eat the cost of tariffs for some vehicles to keep prices from rising. But an expiration date for this generosity could be imminent: Last week, Ford’s CEO went on CNN and couldn’t say if prices would increase in the summertime. With so much left uncertain in Trump’s trade war, some small businesses are down to the wire. Many of them don’t have the cash to stockpile inventory or the storage space to keep it. The owners of the American vegan-cheese company Rebel Cheese have roughly a month to decide what to do. Much of their cheese relies on fair-trade cashews imported from Vietnam, which faces the threat of 46 percent tariffs, and their inventory is dwindling. The company already went through a round of layoffs a few weeks ago; at this point, adding at least a 10 percent price increase seems inevitable, Fred Zwar, one of the co-founders, told me. They are considering breaking down the numbers for customers when they announce the change, but the sharp fluctuations of Trump’s tariffs make the timing tricky: “We can’t do a price raise today and then say, Hey, they raised it another 90 percent. We need to do another price raise tomorrow,” Zwar said. All of this feels like déjà vu for Peelaways. Cohen dealt with Trump’s seesawing tariffs during his first term, which also coincided with COVID-19’s economic downturn. He laid off all six of his workers and restructured his business in order to stay afloat, leaving him with two C-suite executives overseas. This time around, he’s running a leaner operation and slowly raising prices $1 a week until he hits a 15 percent increase. His plan is to test different newsletters to measure his customer base’s feedback: One will include the standard fare (caregiver tips, customer reviews), and the other will acknowledge the tariffs’ effects on pricing. But even having gone through this before, Cohen can’t be sure he’ll make it out again. “We’re all just holding our breath,” he said, waiting for “whatever the next tweet brings.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Evening Read The Real Motive Behind the Real ID–Deadline Charade By Juliette Kayyem Today’s deadline was largely artificial: According to the fine print of the regulations governing Real ID’s implementation, Homeland Security has until the end of 2027 to phase in the program in full.

Title: Supply Chain Expert: “It’s Going To Be An Extinction-Level, Asteroid-Wiping-Out-The-Dinosaurs Kind Of Event”

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Michael Snyder | May 7, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now, expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that, shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course, anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone who cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs anytime soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Forbes Daily: AI Models Are Hallucinating More Despite Advancements

Today is the start of the REAL ID requirement at airport security checkpoints, but if you don’t have one, don’t panic. Most people will still be allowed to fly, according to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A standard, state-issued driver’s license is no longer enough to get through security—you’ll need one that typically has a star in the upper right corner, though each state’s version looks different. And while you may get through security without a REAL ID, it could mean going through extra screening, so plan to arrive three hours ahead of your flight. The requirement, aimed at improving security, has been long-delayed. But if you have a passport or one of roughly a dozen other compliant forms of identification, there’s no need to rush on obtaining a REAL ID. An army soldier stands guard on the rooftop of a mosque building damaged by a suspected Indian ... More missile attack near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan controlled Kashmir. (AP Photo/M.D. Mughal) India launched missile strikes in Pakistan Wednesday, two weeks after it accused Pakistan of being involved in a terrorist attack on the tourist town of Pahalgam that killed over two dozen people. Pakistani officials denounced the strikes, calling them “an unprovoked and blatant act of war.” The nuclear-armed nations have been at odds for decades, but tensions have risen in recent weeks following the Pahalgam attack. Even as AI models become more advanced, they’re increasingly prone to hallucinations, or false information created by false reasoning, presenting a challenge for the industry. For instance, company tests show OpenAI’s newest o3 and o4-mini models have hallucinated 30-50% of the time, and it’s unclear why. U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell Despite demands from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates as the central bank’s rate-setting committee meets this week. Economists at the three largest investment banks all predict the Fed will keep rates steady as it grapples with inflation that remains above its 2% target. Legal AI startup Legora is in talks to raise $85 million in funding at a $675 million valuation, following a string of deals with big name law firms. The firm’s software helps lawyers draft contracts, review and analyze documents, and run checks against legal databases, automating some of the most repetitive and tedious tasks for attorneys. Amazon-owned robotaxi firm Zoox has issued a software recall for 270 of its vehicles after an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle in Las Vegas last month. The incident didn’t result in any injuries, and the robotaxis are back on the road, but it adds to a series of challenges for the fledgling industry. The Trump Organization disclosed in a filing submitted to British regulators that President Donald Trump retains influence over the trust that controls one of his U.K. golf resorts and, via a web of additional entities, virtually every other asset in his empire. By stating that Trump has control over the trust, his own business appears to admit that Trump maintains a grip on his business empire, despite some efforts to portray separation. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump Administration’s transgender military ban to take effect again while a legal case against it moves forward. A lower court had paused the policy, but it is now in effect until it potentially comes back to the highest court again. an airport control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport Newly released audio reveals that air traffic controllers temporarily lost all contact with planes approaching Newark Airport on April 28. Following the incident, some air traffic controllers took time off, and a shortage of controllers has caused hundreds of delayed and canceled flights at the airport over the past week. In recent days, President Donald Trump and top advisor Stephen Miller have suggested immigrants may not be entitled to due process before being deported, as the Trump Administration faces pushback over its mass deportation plans. But that conflicts with longstanding legal precedent: In 1993, conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that “the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.” For a variety of reasons, elite college admissions are becoming an impossible dream—even for perfect students. Today, 19 of 20 applications submitted to nearly all of the schools in the Ivy League are rejected. And it’s not just the super elite: Admission rates are plunging at popular schools like Northeastern University and New York University. Lower admissions rates lead to more stress and more heartbreak. But while the traditional May 1 decision deadline has come and gone, it’s not too late to secure a college acceptance for the fall term. Through April and May, hundreds of colleges report to the National Association for College Admission Counselors that they still have seats available in their incoming freshman classes. As of Wednesday, 281 colleges told NACAC they’re still seeking applicants. Many of these colleges are excellent, and in an effort to highlight the best colleges in need of freshmen, Forbes has culled the list for schools that appear on the 2025 Forbes Top Colleges list, as well as the Princeton Review’s 2025 list of Best Colleges. One option is the University of San Francisco, a private Jesuit university that is popular for health professions programs. And if internships are a goal, Philadelphia’s Drexel University, with 12,000 undergraduates and 100 majors and minors, is known for its co-op program, which places students in paying jobs for six-month stints at employers like Comcast, Dupont, Estee Lauder, Vanguard and Johnson & Johnson. WHY IT MATTERS “Heading into high school graduation season without a college admission offer is disheartening, no doubt, but it’s not time to give up on college ambitions,” says Forbes staff writer Emma Whitford. “Students who didn’t get any college acceptances still have plenty of excellent schools to apply to for the fall, and a strong transfer application to your dream school next spring will fare better than a first-year application following a gap year.” MORE America’s Top Colleges If trade negotiations fall through, the European Union could consider placing additional tariffs on more than $110 billion in U.S. exports. That would impact everything from cars to oil and gas: $10 billion: The worth of new cars exported from the U.S. to the EU in 2023 3.5%: The share of all U.S. global exports that went to Germany in 2022 Nearly 1 million: The number of jobs in the U.S. supported by trade in services with the EU in 2023 With layoffs in the news, it’s natural to worry that your position could be on the chopping block. In a recent survey, HR directors and managers identified five red flags that could signal a role could be eliminated, including whether a position can be replaced by AI, or if the role relies on outdated skillsets. Consider making a career pivot that leverages your skills if your position is at risk of automation, and make sure to regularly assess your performance with your boss.

Title: When The CEO Is The Corporate Brand: How To Manage Reputational Risks

ByBrian Cattell ByBrian Cattell, Forbes Councils Member. Brian Cattell, Managing Partner at CLP Strategies, a strategic communications firm with offices in New York City and London. It’s not new for charismatic CEOs to be the face of the corporations they lead. In 2025, however, with many business leaders seeming to be either permanently on social media, on TV or quoted in the newspapers, many CEOs have effectively become the company brand. It’s not just the extreme examples like Elon Musk. More sober but still ubiquitous corporate titans such as Andy Jassy of Amazon, Jensen Huang of Nvidia or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Today’s rapidly evolving ecosystem of new digital, social and legacy media platforms means that these executives are in the spotlight more than any others in corporate history. In many ways, today’s CEOs are behaving more like influencers. They comment on market trends, share views on AI and even weigh in on how everyday people spend their free time. Every post or statement is instantly shared, analyzed and judged. As a result, corporate communications teams must now manage not only the company’s brand but also a highly visible, human brand—one that’s imperfect, spontaneous and constantly speaking. Consider WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick’s infamous "let them eat cake" moment in 2024. In a CNBC interview, Pilnick suggested cereal as a low-cost dinner option amid rising food prices—claiming it could feed a family for just $1. The backlash was swift. His comments went viral, drawing sharp criticism online from people who saw the remarks as tone-deaf and out of touch. Although Pilnick—new to the role at the time—kept his job and WK Kellogg avoided lasting damage, it’s safe to assume his communications team likely spent several intense days managing the fallout. How can a company let a CEO be themselves and convey authenticity without a script while safely representing the corporate brand without undue reputational risk? There’s no doubt that authenticity has value—genuine, unfiltered communication can build trust with both internal and external audiences. Live videos, spontaneous interviews and off-the-cuff Q&As often resonate more than polished scripts. But these moments also carry serious risks. A casual, poorly worded remark can easily veer off-message, triggering internal frustration among employees or, worse, sparking public backlash. Anything from political opinion to comments about layoffs, the workforce and much more are at risk of being misinterpreted. So, how should the internal communications team or external advisers to the corporation manage these new risks? First, media training needs to go beyond traditional TV or print media. It now needs to cover the right tone and body language for TikTok or Instagram, LinkedIn etiquette and dealing with live comments from customers or employees in an open forum environment. Before CEOs go out into the world to communicate, there needs to be some deep thinking about content strategy. It needs to balance personal branding for the individual with corporate messaging. Don’t forget to plan for different scenarios. Comms teams, particularly those supporting high-profile business leaders, should have a multistep plan that follows the possibility of their CEO’s comment or post going viral for the wrong reason. Finally, PRs have been practicing the art of rapid rebuttal in the media for decades. In today’s environment, speed for response across all content verticals is just as critical. Prepare well and be ready to step in should things go south. The great paradox of the modern CEO as the corporate brand is that it stems from a desire to be relatable to many more people than were traditionally reached by the words and actions of company executives. However, by striving to be relatable through greater public exposure, business leaders increase their risk of doing or saying the wrong thing. If that happens, they end up being anything but the person that someone would love to have a beer with. While high-profile gaffes often dominate headlines, a CEO’s internal reputation can be just as critical. When the CEO embodies the company’s identity, their mistakes don’t just damage the brand externally—they can also shake confidence within the organization. Misjudged statements—especially during sensitive moments like layoffs or changes to DEI or remote work policies—can spark anything from employee backlash to public criticism. As a result, communications teams must now monitor internal sentiment as closely as they do media, customer and investor reactions. The challenge for those managing a CEO brand in 2025 is to balance risk and reward. The leader’s voice can be a very powerful tool, but it requires careful management, strategy and real-time monitoring. In an age where saying the wrong thing can spark a consumer boycott or an employee walkout, the CEO doesn’t just speak for the company—they often are the company.

As part of my job, I spend quite a bit of time each week speaking with job-seekers and perusing job boards to see who is hiring and for what positions. In the last month, one thing has been—at least anecdotally—clear: More job postings are popping up. Friday’s job numbers confirmed this trend. The U.S. added 177,000 new jobs in April, higher than analysts’ expectations, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wages also rose 3.8% year-over-year to a record average of $36.06 an hour for nonfarm employees. But economists are warning against too much optimism from Friday’s report. For one, the private sector added only 62,000 jobs in April, less than half of what analysts expected as employers held tight in the face of the expected impact from tariffs, marking the slowest job growth in the sector since July 2024. “Unease is the word of the day,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP said in the company’s national employment report. Then there are the layoff numbers. While unemployment remained flat at 4.2%, layoffs increased by 63% compared to last April, though they decreased month-over-month. DOGE-related cuts accounted for almost half of all layoffs, either by directly cutting government positions or by the downstream effects of such cuts. And increased hiring numbers could be a result of companies’ front-ending against tariff and macroeconomic impacts, preparing themselves for tougher times. Still, President Trump was optimistic, celebrating “strong employment” numbers. We’ll be keeping our eyes out to see how things shake up, especially as the class of 2025 joins the market. Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. When the roles are flipped, how should you deliver bad news to your boss? In the world of hypercommunication, here is how to make sure you’re communicating effectively. An increasing number of workers are taking microretirements to prevent burnout. Watch out for these signs that you could be the first cut in a layoff. News from the world of work. AI startups are increasingly requiring their employees to work six or seven days a week, Forbes’ Richard Nieva reports. While hustle culture has always been glorified in Silicon Valley, this could be the first time companies are brazen enough to advertise the long-hour expectations. The Philippines is the latest country to offer a digital nomad visa for remote workers. The requirements are quite standard, including proving you are able to generate sufficient income outside the country. Feeling understaffed? It’s not just your company. The Wall Street Journal found that while corporate America isn’t massively laying off workers, many have paused hiring and are leaving more jobs unfilled. Turns out laying off employees and replacing them with AI is not as easy—or effective—as it looks. A new survey found that 55% of leaders who let go of workers as a direct result of deploying more AI functions admit they made the wrong decision. Under President Trump, the IRS has shed more than 11% of its workforce, and more cuts are on the way, Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb reports. Layoffs at the agency have impacted workers across the country, including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, with tax auditors being the hardest hit. With an increased focus on efficiency, Amazon is the latest Big Tech company to reshape its compensation strategy for top performers, Business Insider reports.

Title: Trump’s Tariff Threat To Hollywood Sparks More Questions Than Answers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/05/06/trumps-tariff-threat-to-hollywood-sparks-more-questions-than-answers/

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff andCFO, Forbes Staff. The Hollywood Sign seen in 2023 President Donald Trump declared Sunday night that his latest tariff target is the film industry. A post on his social network Truth Social said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” adding other countries’ incentives for filming movies—which often draw production to other shores—constitutes “a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump’s directive: Authorizing the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to “begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Most people involved in the entertainment industry responded the same way: With a big question mark. It’s not clear what Trump is targeting: Films for U.S. audiences shot on location elsewhere? Foreign films with global distribution, like South Korea’s Parasite, the 2020 Best Picture Oscar winner? And are these just films for theatrical release or would it include movies and series made for streaming networks? Where and how would this tariff be applied? If enacted, this kind of tariff could deeply impact the film industry. Many of the last decade’s top grossing movies were made outside of the U.S. Investors sharply pulled back as markets opened on Monday, with Netflix initially seeing its stock drop 4% and losing $20.4 billion market capitalization—almost the total current value of Warner Bros. Discovery. The stock market closed with smaller losses for Netflix and other entertainment companies, including Disney and Paramount Global, but no more clarity on these potential tariffs from the White House. Not often one to agree with Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom entered the discussion Monday with his own proposal: The state would collaborate with the federal government to enact a $7.5 billion incentive program to help domestic movie production. It’s unclear if the White House will discuss the matter with Newsom. On Monday, Trump called Newsom a “grossly incompetent governor that allowed” the movie business to go to other countries. And it also remains to be seen if this proposal will advance. (After all, the Truth Social post that started the discussion was made half an hour after Trump used the social media platform to endorse reopening San Francisco’s Alcatraz as a federal prison, which got this response from Newsom to CBS Sacramento: “You can’t even come up with a more colossally bad fiscal idea.”) What it does show are two different approaches to the common goal of building domestic industry. Trump is reaching for tariffs, while Newsom is proposing incentives. Each has benefits and drawbacks, not least of which is the immediate response from industry and investors. How the issue plays out—if at all—will show the way policy and business intermingle, and what truly works today. Protecting data and advancing cybersecurity isn’t just the CIO’s responsibility, especially given how vital that information is to making future projections—and how costly data breaches can be. I talked to Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, about how CFOs and CIOs can come together. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader looks at different stock indexes on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the ... More opening bell in New York City, on May 6, 2025. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Pedestrians walk past the American lifestyle and performance footwear brand Skechers store in Hong ... More Kong. Skechers, the U.S.’s third-largest footwear company by sales, will be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital in a deal worth $9.4 billion. The deal will take the publicly traded company private, and is expected to close later this year. CEO and cofounder Robert Greenberg will remain in that role and continue to lead the company’s strategy, but he and his family will make $1.1 billion on the sale, writes Forbes’ Jemima McEvoy and Matt Durot. Last week, as part of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, Skechers signed a letter to Trump saying that tariffs posed an “existential threat” to the footwear industry, arguing that U.S. consumers would be unable to bear increased costs for shoes and that tens of thousands of industry jobs were on the line. A source close to the deal told CNBC that the timing and nature of the acquisition have nothing to do with tariffs and the current situation; 3G Capital has had its eye on Skechers as an acquisition target for some time. A sign outside of IRS headquarters in Washington, DC. The Trump Administration’s deep cuts to federal government employees have removed 11% of the workforce at the IRS so far, according to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. The cuts are not spread evenly across the agency. Nearly a third of all revenue agents—usually CPAs who audit tax returns—who were there in January have been cut. About 18% of revenue officers, who focus on collections, are no longer there. About half of employees who are no longer at the IRS worked with small businesses and self-employed entities. Springline Advisory CTO Abhesh Kumar In today’s business world, data and cybersecurity threats are always multiplying. Abhesh Kumar, chief technology officer at financial advisory firm Springline Advisory, sees one way to strengthen both a company’s use and understanding of data and its security: Having finance and data or technology leaders work together on it. I talked to him about why this is an important partnership and how to make it work. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What can help fill gaps in knowledge about data between CFOs and CIOs? Kumar: Both CTOs and CFOs need to take joint ownership as stewards of data assets. While technology [departments have] always taken the role of protecting all the data, in forward-leaning organizations such as Springline, CFOs are now embedding cybersecurity and data protection as part of their financial risk management. This is now getting recognized that the reputational risk, the compliance risk, and, frankly, the financial risk that could arise out of a lack of data protection could greatly cross even some of the more traditional forms of risk. This awareness comes back to the CTO or CIO and CFO working very closely and collaboratively as joint stakeholders in data protection and vulnerability management. There’s a cultural angle to it. Often CTOs and CFOs exist in siloed worlds. Leading by example and making joint appearances at the board level, where you’re seen as co-equal stakeholders in being the stewards of managing the protection of data assets, also drives a behavior down the chain of working in tandem and building that cohesion, which eventually reduces the blind spots for everybody. Some of the other things from a practical perspective will be proactive monitoring of threats and a proactive approach toward training and developing skill: Anti-phishing training, anti-social engineering trainings, deploying cybersecurity not as a one-off measure but embedding it into your business processes so that you are designing the system with cybersecurity at the front-and-center of your approach. With increased communication and collaboration, the chances of security being seen as a trade off between collaboration or innovation starts to blur, and a middle part starts to emerge where you can actually have the best of both words. You can be fairly agile and nimble in your business processes without really compromising or taking on non-compliance risk. A recent study from KPMG looking at the dynamic between CFOs and CIOs found that they both claim ownership of things dealing with data and tech, but have different viewpoints on what it’s for and why they’re doing it. Do you see this kind of difference of perception as an impediment to working together? I do not necessarily see it as an impediment. I actually see it as an opportunity to bring two diverse points of view together on a problem that will have collective impact on both stakeholders. The CFO and the CTO, it’s given that they have slightly different KPIs. Once they double-click and triple-click on some of the approaches towards protecting data assets, they will realize there’s rich and fertile ground for collaboration in elevating the data protection together. Technology risk can manifest itself in financial risk and damage, and financial risk can certainly bring down the technology pillar of the organization. I see it as a shared interest—even though both parties bring different points of view, but also different strengths and motivations to essentially do the right thing for the organization as a whole. That’s how I see it as an opportunity for collaboration. In fact, it’s all the more reason they should be collaborating, because the impact is greater on the whole than individuals. What advice would you give to a CFO to start working with their CIO or CTO in this manner? First, convince yourself that this is important, and talk to your CTO. Build that awareness of what the lack of good cybersecurity or data security procedures translates into dollar terms. CFOs understand dollar terms very clearly, and CTOs have to step up and be able to translate that risk. This is part of that collaboration: They need to make it easy for the CFO to understand because it is not just the loss of data. It’s the value of that data, plus reputational risk, compliance risk, disclosure risk for your clients. The CFO must understand the actual dollar impact of this risk, and then lead by example. CFO could be seen as a champion of cybersecurity by taking on an executive sponsor role for some of these defense mechanisms like training. That sends a message across the organization that this is something at the very senior level that’s being taken by the CFO. In return, the CFO gets enhanced security, enhanced visibility of the data and a close partnership with the technology department that protects their crown jewels.

ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Asian equities were mixed overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China returned from holiday refreshed and in good spirits (similar to how I feel post-vacation), and Indonesia outperformed while Thailand underperformed. Japan was closed for Greenery Day, a holiday “dedicated to appreciating nature and expressing gratitude for its blessings.” South Korea was closed for Vesak Day, which is also Buddha’s Birthday. Hong Kong and Mainland China were driven higher by green shoots in U.S.-China trade talks last Friday and over the weekend, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s positive comments yesterday. Asian currencies have made monster moves versus the U.S. dollar. The Taiwan dollar is up +7.29% and the offshore CNY (CNH) is up +0.96% since April 28. The Chinese people were on the move during the May Day holiday, with 101.7 million railway passengers and 11.15 million airline passengers, while 10.896 million foreigners visited China, according to Mainland media sources. According to the South China Morning Post, people opened their wallets, with 60,000 auto trade-in subsidy applications. Meanwhile, home appliance sales during the holiday were up +15.5% year-over-year, auto sales were up +13.7% YoY, communication equipment sales were up+10.5% YoY, and home and apartment sales data appear strong in the top 30 major cities. The April Caixin Services PMI was 50.7 versus expectations of 51.8 and March’s 51.9 as the month-over-month indicator declines from tariff front running. Hong Kong soft technology (internet), airlines, hotels, restaurants, and Macau casino stocks outperformed overnight. Hardware technology stocks, including biotechnology, and semiconductors, underperformed, led by index heavyweight Xiaomi, which was down -2.92%. Mainland investors bought a healthy $1.7 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs today as Meituan and Alibaba saw an inflow, while Tencent saw a small outflow. From a breadth perspective, Mainland China had a very strong day led by growth stocks, with 4,677 advancing stocks and only 396 declining stocks. Unlike Hong Kong, hard technology stocks had a very strong day, led by electronic equipment, semiconductors, software, and travel and consumer plays, such as airlines. Hopefully, the positive momentum continues! Investor’s Business Daily had an insightful article over the weekend titled, “The Trade War Comes Ashore,” providing a timeline of the coming tariff tsunami effect on store shelves and retail employment. Maritime consulting firm Drewry anticipates 2025 cargo volumes will decline for only the third time since 1979. The only two declines were the 2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Apollo Global Management believes that domestic freight and retail companies will begin layoffs by early June as “most retailers will have run through their stockpiled inventory.” Companies anticipating inventory issues mentioned in the article include Amazon, Target, and Walmart, though the list is far more expansive. Even if the U.S. and China governments make significant progress over the next few weeks, the American people will likely discover how reliant and intertwined our two economies are. I suspect most Americans don’t want their kids working in low-end manufacturing versus high-end manufacturing and innovation industries (brain versus brawn industries). Obviously, there are things that should be made here in the U.S. for national security reasons, but the vast majority of what is made in China and Asia more broadly and sold in U.S. stores doesn’t fit that criteria. Ultimately, not even politicians can overpower economic laws, just as President Hoover and Senators Smoot and Hawley learned nearly a century ago.

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy a second time

Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating, and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

Title: Hollywood is the latest industry to get skittish about Trump's tariffs

Good morning! Some of the world's elite gathered for the Met Gala last night. (My invite must have got lost in the mail.) Here's a rundown on how the event went. We also made our picks for who was the best-dressed — and who missed the mark. In today's big story, President Donald Trump has targeted movies made outside the US with his latest tariffs, but no one really knows what it means. I know your inbox is already pretty full, but you're going to want to make room for this. Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr on what's happening at the world's most powerful tech companies, is launching soon. Subscribe here! What's on deck Markets: Warren Buffett's retirement announcement was a downer for Berkshire Hathaway's stock. Tech: Former Meta employees shared what it was like to be laid off as "low performers." Business: Austin is the first battleground for Tesla and Waymo's driverless taxis to face off. But first, lights! Cameras! Tariffs! If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. EXT: PORT OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY - DAY A walking film reel departs from a European container ship and approaches a customs officer awaiting exiting passengers. FILM REEL Hello! I'm the new summer blockbuster, and I'm ready for the big screen! CUSTOMS AGENT Not until you pay up on these tariffs! My first attempt at screenwriting might not make sense, but the same could be said for President Donald Trump's latest tariff announcement focused on Hollywood. On Sunday, the president said he'd save Hollywood from "dying a very fast death" due to productions shifting out of the country by imposing a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. The problem, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka points out in this piece, is that no one quite understands what putting tariffs on films made outside the US means or how it would work. Trump isn't wrong that tax incentives and labor costs have led Hollywood to look overseas. But how would one enforce these tariffs? What level of work done on a movie outside the US would trigger the tariffs? And, as my short film above illustrates, how do you even tariff something that doesn't physically arrive here via cargo ships or planes? (You can read more about Peter's theories here. Hint: Tax breaks and other financial incentives.) Trump said Monday afternoon he was "not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help." What's not debatable was the industry's initial reaction. Shares of top streamers and movie companies like Netflix and Walt Disney took a dip Monday morning. Maybe the best way to understand these latest tariffs is to look at them more holistically. At least, that was the pitch from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday at the Milken conference, where BI's Bradley Saacks was in attendance. In front of a crowd of the world's biggest and most powerful asset managers, Bessent made the case that the administration's overall trade plans were part of a three-pronged approach. Tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation work together "to solidify our position as the home of global capital," Bessent told the group. The framing was meant to help investors digest the volatile first 100 days of Trump's presidency, thanks largely to his focus on tariffs. Carlyle CEO Harvey Schwartz and Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, who followed Bessent's speech, said tying together tariffs with deregulation and tax cuts was a good way to articulate Trump's broader plan. Whether the rest of the attendees agreed remains to be seen. 1. It's time to start rooting for the rich. The wealthy don't like higher prices, but they're spending through it. Their buying habits are holding up the consumer-driven US economy — but if they start to cut back, everyone else will feel the contraction. 2. Berkshire Hathaway's stock tumbles on Buffett news. The conglomerate's stock dropped as much as 7% on Monday after Warren Buffett announced his retirement over the weekend. Shareholders are wondering what Berkshire will look like without Buffett at the helm. 3. Elite colleges are rushing to the bond market. MIT plans to sell $750 million worth of taxable bonds, according to May 2 preliminary offering documents. It joins a list of elite colleges that have tapped the bond market as the Trump administration threatens to slash federal funding for universities. 1. Meta's "low performers" on those brutal layoffs. Eight former employees told BI what it was like to be caught in the company's sweeping job cuts — and the stigma that comes with being labeled a "low performer." 2. Amazon rewards consistently high performers. The retail giant is revamping its pay structure to better recognize and reward long-term high performers, per internal guidelines obtained by BI. The compensation overhaul reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech. 3. Microsoft's controversial management approach. The software giant is putting some ousted low performers on a two-year rehiring ban and identifies these job cuts as "good attrition," according to an internal document viewed by BI. It's similar to hardcore performance-management strategies used at Meta and Amazon. 1. Tesla vs. Waymo. The two companies' driverless taxis will go head-to-head in Austin in June, when Tesla launches its services in the city. Here's how the robotaxis compare on cost, training, business strategy, and more. 2. OpenAI says its nonprofit will remain in control after all. In September, the AI giant announced it was moving to a for-profit business model. Read the letter CEO Sam Altman sent to employees explaining the decision to reverse course. 3. Google wants the star power. The tech company quietly launched a film and TV production initiative called 100 Zeros, BI has learned. Google hopes 100 Zeros will boost its image among Gen Z, but it plans to skip out on YouTube as a distributor. President Trump hosts Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House.

Title: WPP Prepares to Kill Off GroupM Name to Make Way for WPP Media

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. WPP is set to retire its GroupM brand, which houses its media agencies, renaming it WPP Media, per several industry reports. ADWEEK also learned of the decision to sunset the 20-year-old name from a source with knowledge of the matter. A WPP spokesperson told ADWEEK: “We don’t comment on speculation.” Switching out the 20-year-old name is set to occur before summer, and follows what WPP chief executive (CEO) Mark Read described in the company’s annual report as a “year of transition” for the media investment division under new CEO Brian Lesser, who joined in September 2024. GroupM employs around 40,000 people, more than a third of WPP’s total global workforce. Ad Age reported that there will be layoffs as part of the process, related to the consolidation of individual media agency teams. WPP declined to comment on any reduction in staff. Just now, GroupM operates with a core group of four global agencies: Mindshare, Wavemaker, EssenceMediacom, and T&Pm. It also offers cross-channel performance via GroupM Nexus, data solutions through Choreograph, and entertainment services via GroupM Motion Entertainment. Per WPP’s website, GroupM manages $63 billion worth of media budgets. Major clients include Amazon and Unilever. Coca-Cola is also a key account, however WPP recently lost the soda giant’s North American media business to rival Publicis Groupe. Lesser revamped GroupM’s leadership restructure in January 2025, axing global CEO positions for individual agencies and naming McKinsey & Company’s Emily Del Greco global chief operating officer (COO). Read recently told ADWEEK that GroupM was a key player in WPP’s turnaround plan as it posted a 5% Q1 2025 revenue dip amid ongoing financial struggles. Year-on-year revenue declined at GroupM for the quarter too, with growth in the U.S. offset by client losses from “previous years” and weakness in China. “At its best, GroupM is extremely competitive. We just need to make sure they’re on their best every day of the week,” Read said at the end of April. Mark Read is Still Banking on a GroupM Turnaround The CEO’s six-year tenure at WPP has been marked by consolidation to cut operating costs. One big change on the creative side involved bringing together VML and Y&R with Wunderman Thomson under the VML brand. On the media side, Read merged digital media agency Essence and media buying firm Mediacom to form EssenceMediacom. He also merged five of WPP’s branding and design agencies into Superunion, which was then combined with Design Bridge to create Design Bridge and Partners. Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

Title: Cisco, UPS, other companies adjusting workforce as they embrace AI: report

Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins discusses denied healthcare claims and overturned rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Some companies have been adjusting their workforce as they simultaneously embrace artificial intelligence and automation more, according to Forbes. The outlet reported over the weekend that Duolingo, UPS, Klarna, Cisco and Inuit are among some of the firms that have demonstrated that trend. Duolingo recently said it was striving to be "AI-first," with CEO Luis von Ahn outlining various measures that it will take to help accomplish that in a publicly available company-wide message, per Forbes. (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Von Ahn said in the message that Duolingo will "gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle" and that headcount "will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work." When hiring and doing performance reviews, people’s abilities to use AI will also be part of what the company considers, according to the message. DUOLINGO ANNOUNCES 148 COURSES CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING SOON ON PLATFORM The CEO said the "AI-first" moves focused on "removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we have" rather than "replacing Duos with AI." At UPS, some 20,000 employees are getting the ax, the company announced in late April. Forbes reported that UPS said AI wasn’t directly taking the place of employees, but the company is working to increase its efficiency through more automation and AI tools, something that the outlet said helped with shrinking its labor demands. UPS and Amazon, its largest customer, agreed in January that the e-commerce giant would reduce its package volume with UPS by more than 50%. Klarna has been leaning into AI more in recent years, using it for customer service, transaction processing and other functions, according to Forbes. (Jonas Walzberg/picture alliance via Getty Images) CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said in the past that certain human work functions can be done by AI, the outlet reported. In February last year, the company said that an AI chatbot it launched was capable of doing the work of 700 full-time agents. AI has enabled Klarna to have a smaller workforce, according to Forbes. Last fall, Cisco Systems embarked on a restructuring so it could invest in AI, cybersecurity and other growth areas, the outlet reported. When announcing the restructuring, the company also said in an SEC filing the move would "drive more efficiencies in its business." AI ENERGY DEMAND IN US WILL SURGE BUT ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE ENERGY Roughly 7% of the company’s workers lost their jobs as part of the restructuring. Cisco has been putting artificial intelligence into network management and customer support systems, Forbes reported. Meanwhile, Intuit announced layoffs of 1,800 workers in July last year as part of a reorganization to boost its investments in artificial intelligence, according to the outlet. CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the reorganization would "enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth," per a company-wide email that the company included in an SEC filing at the time. The company identified AI-powered tools it offers as some of the initiatives that it wanted to put more money into, Forbes reported. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File) At the same time, Goodarzi said Intuit would hire 1,800 new people "primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles" to support its growth areas. A MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI started seeing a major increase in uptake in the wake of OpenAI releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, spurring major investments and innovations in the sector.

Title: Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Trump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down China vowed this week it would "never kneel down" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, "essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased," said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects "empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks" and "Covid-like shortages for consumers." That slowdown, Slok said, would result in "significant" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate "substantial" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. "Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst," China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video. A report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "hostile and political act." The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and "was never approved." Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and "solved the problem very quickly," praising him as a "good guy" who "did the right thing." Trump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a "short term" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately "slaughter" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. "China probably will eat those tariffs," he said. "Everything's going to be just fine." Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

"Economic mayhem is setting in" thanks to Trump's "crackpot tariff ideas," said the Houston Chronicle. The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. "It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them." Amazon should have stuck with its "brilliant tariff idea," saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but "instead of owning its policy," the White House "bullied Amazon to keep quiet." What is Trump afraid of? Small businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've "been stunned into paralysis" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then "disappeared overnight," and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. Consumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But "boatloads of pain" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs "might steal Christmas," said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production "has ground to a halt," and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months. Trump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic "golden age." Instead, his "chaotic" tariffs are "shaking the foundations" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden "overhang." But "every American" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com "We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations," said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, "until it didn't." Right now, "the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis," the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, "the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus." Trump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly "inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment." Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is "more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war." And the Chinese have "tools at hand to hit America's economy where it hurts, including the withholding of critical minerals and key inputs to America's industrial value chains." In short, "Beijing believes time is on its side," so if there's going to be a retreat in the trade war, "it will need to come from Trump."

Title: Rite Aid files for bankruptcy — again | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is being estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone that cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs any time soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Weighing The Positives Of Fully Remote Workplaces

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. As technology continues to define business opportunities, there are basic needs that are integral to every development. Last week, I attended a panel at Honeywell’s Future of Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., at which top industry and policy leaders discussed two: energy and AI. Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry at Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, said that AI is becoming as ubiquitous among businesses as energy. “Would you ever ask a business owner if they use math?” Crahan asked. Gordon Bitko, IT Industry Council executive vice president of policy, said energy and AI are inextricably linked. “AI uses a lot of power, so the answer is: Let’s use more AI to figure out how to use less energy,” Bitko said. Industry has used AI technology for years to determine ways to be more efficient, so this sounds like a paradox. AI is being used to create hardware that can process data better, and it only makes sense to use AI to determine the best ways to generate power, optimize workloads and automate data centers. Crahan’s project is building an AI-powered, unified platform for the electric grid. Crahan said Tapestry is essentially creating “Google Maps for electrons” to figure out and predict what’s happening throughout the grid. And the rise of AI— which she called a wonderful tool for helping solve extremely complex problems with data—is coming at the perfect time. But while AI can find solutions, it comes back to the question of power. Bitko said that for AI to do its best, the U.S. needs to de-risk investment in the technologies that can improve performance and capacity for energy infrastructure, as well as get the critical materials available to build them. China has not been waiting to move forward, Bilko said, and the U.S. shouldn’t either. Crahan added that there’s another key to making quick advancements: People talking to one another and sharing their solutions. This isn’t just a matter of companies and countries talking, but also people from different parts of organizations communicating and understanding one another. “It’s really on us to take those actions forward, and that is what gives me a lot of optimism is this community is here for the change and we help each other,” Crahan said. “We want to drive change, and I think that’s really special.” Honeywell Global Regions CEO Anant Maheshwari moderated the discussion, in which Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) also participated. Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office this year, but there are still fully remote companies. I spoke with Ann Schlemmer, CEO of software company Percona, about why her employees will not be asked to report to an office anytime soon. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last Wednesday. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Warren Buffett in 2017. One of the world’s most respected CEOs unexpectedly announced over the weekend that he would step down at the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing the reins of the firm to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel, which he announced at the end of his address at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes the news surprised nearly everyone there—board members and Abel included—though the timing seems to make sense. Buffett is 94 and worth some $168 billion over the weekend, according to Forbes estimates. Buffett has been Berkshire Hathaway CEO since 1965, and the announcement of his step down received a standing ovation. Abel, a 62-year-old Canadian who’s been with Berkshire since it acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999, will have big shoes to fill. Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is an American legend for his shrewdness in investing. Even this year prior to Buffett’s announcement, Berkshire’s stock is up 19%, nearly matching its compounded annual gain of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024. Just about every company wants to improve its adoption of and expertise in AI this year, and C-suite executives are also getting into it. According to a recent survey by LinkedIn, 88% of C-suite execs say speeding AI adoption is a top priority this year. Executives are looking for their employees to become AI experts, but they aren’t forgetting themselves. C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely to add AI literacy skills to their LinkedIn profile than other professionals, and three times as many C-suite leaders have AI skills on their profiles now compared to two years ago. This isn’t to say that C-suites across the board are getting the AI skills they need. About four in 10 leaders said their top team is preventing AI adoption, citing reasons like lack of training, no change management plan, and failure to be convinced of AI’s ROI. LinkedIn and Microsoft have opened several AI skills courses, making them free of charge for several months. The time spent gaining AI skills is likely to pay off. LinkedIn found that 51% of organizations that adopted generative AI reported revenue increases of at least 10%. Percona CEO Ann Schlemmer. Open source database software company Percona has always been a fully remote company since its founding in 2006, so it was already in the swing of a distributed workforce when most of the country’s offices shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. Percona currently has just over 350 employees located in 52 countries around the globe, and CEO Ann Schlemmer says they have no intention of requiring them to work together in an office somewhere. (Percona does have a headquarters office in North Carolina, where the COO works.) I talked to Schlemmer about being an all-remote company in a world that is moving toward requiring employees to return to the office. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Why does being remote work for Percona? Schlemmer: We put a lot of work behind it. This was our intention from the very beginning: don’t let geography determine your talent. It also was a little bit of a labor arbitrage, that you could get high quality talent and maybe in lower cost centers. Trying to get all tech talent from Silicon Valley is really expensive. We have always been bootstrapped and customer-funded—we haven’t taken outside funding. That was also part of the drive: finding those areas of technical expertise globally that other people may not have found. Are you receiving more interest from potential employees now that a lot of workplaces are putting out return to office mandates? Yes. Flexibility [is a common reason] for sure. In our company, we’ve always had this mentality of being able to flex and have that flexibility as long as you get the job done. That said, not every job has flexibility. [In] some of our customer-facing roles, it’s very clear that you're expected to be available for the customers between certain hours. As a CEO, what I really care about is someone getting their job done in the time that we expect them to get it done and that they have the tools and capabilities to do that. Expectations with your colleagues on your availability would happen whether you’re remote or in person. There has to be a really high degree of trust when you are a remote worker—which also means that you need to have a high level of your own personal accountability in getting the job done, being clear on expectations and can you fulfill those expectations in that environment. With you at the helm, would you ever consider making Percona a company where people have to go into an office? I don’t see that it would ever be a whole company initiative. I could see that if there was a business case: That we had a specific team that was trying to drive new product innovation and the request was, we have the center and we want to be in person to do that, or we found that that really is the most effective. I could see that as very use-case specific. The company itself now, I wouldn't see the advantage of that. And for us in our structure, it would be a massive cost that I don’t think would give me an ROI that would make it appealing. What advice would you give to business leaders who have been much more remote since Covid and are trying to decide whether they should go back to an office? If the question is singularly return to the office or stay remote, start with what problem you are trying to solve and have clarity on that. Really large corporations have a big commercial investment that they’ve made into real estate, so, versus selling that off, they want a return on that investment. They want people coming in. And their culture and systems have been built around being in-person. That is pretty compelling. It’s a matter of defining what problem are you trying to solve, being clear on that and gaming it out to understand what are the consequences, positives, and potentially negatives of those decisions—which is what business leaders do anyway. They always have to weigh the cost of their decisions.

Title: These 5 Red Flags Could Make You First To Be Laid Off In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You may be a liability if you have outdated skill sets. With 2025 breaking records for the most layoffs in February since the pandemic, and the highest number of tech job cuts in April, you’re probably scared that you’ll be the next one receiving a mass email or invited to a suspicious HR call. Increasing numbers of employers are adapting to the AI era, and that means implementing sweeping changes or “restructuring” across their workforce and workflows, and removing employees who don’t align with their agenda or who are costing the company too much money or lack of “efficiency,” as they often term it. Additionally, some like Intel, as reported by TechCrunch, have had lower quarterly earnings than expected, which has necessitated these employers looking across their divisions and seeing what employees are core to the business and which ones they can do without or dispense with. Frankly, when employers make these layoff decisions, there are three top criteria that they evaluate which ultimately influence the specific employees they decide to let go. In an update sent via email, General Assembly interviewed HR directors and managers in tech companies and found that the employees most likely to be let go include those who display these five red flags: It may not be what you want to hear, especially when it comes to remote work, but this is the reality. Thankfully, there are things you can do about it. If you can be replaced by AI, the odds are you will be. And if you’re not sure if your job is prone to being replaced by automation, just check out this list of 21 jobs that are bound to be obsolete by 2030 and are rapidly declining even now. So if you discover that you’re working in a job at high risk of being fully automated, then now is the time to seriously consider making a career pivot. Consider other career paths and job opportunities that leverage your transferable skills and any industry background you have which might be relevant. Think about what you have a passion in, and take time to research what jobs and new skill sets will be in high demand right now, as new job titles are created. Your skills become outdated when you’re not willing to adapt and embrace change. If you remain stuck in the same mindset since you first embarked on your job or career, you will never grow. A growth mindset acknowledges changes that are happening, and instead of ignoring them, seeks to adapt by upskilling, undertaking more professional development, seeking out new opportunities, and reflecting on one’s progress. To ensure your skills are always up to date and in high demand, check out the core skills and rising skills you need in today’s labor market based on recent data from the World Economic Forum, so you can strengthen those areas and include them in your resume. It’s a good idea to periodically check in with your manager to assess how well you’re performing against key indicators and employee standards, including company culture. Don’t just be passive and wait for your boss to inform you when it’s too late. While a good manager will inform you without needing to be asked, some won’t, so you need to be proactive and regularly gauge your performance. Come well-prepared for your one-to-one meetings with your manager. Take time to be self-aware and journal your progress in your job. Note down areas where you could do with some improvement or support, as well as areas where you find you’re exceptionally strong in, and bring these to your line manager. Ask them for support in your weak areas and see if they could recommend or signpost you to peer mentorship or other internal company resources to support your growth. Outside of your job, take time to strengthen your incompetency by undergoing extra training and courses, and attending events if necessary. Of course, there will always be times when a company catches you by surprise and lists your name along with other underperforming employees in a cop-out to cover their atrocious layoffs. You should ensure that you have accurate documentation of your progress and conversations with your manager about your performance so you can challenge this if necessary. If you work in a department that is severely defunded or not receiving due attention and allocation of resources, that’s a strong warning sign that your job is likely on the line. If not now, it will be later. Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of senior leadership dismissing specific departments or projects as not being key priorities. Review your company’s annual statement, its vision, and long-term strategies for the next three to five years. These provide strong indicators of where the company is headed, what areas leadership wants to focus on, and where new job opportunities may arise. If you sense that your role or department might be eliminated in any way, ask your manager to consider how you can progress to another department or role internally. Proactively seek to engage with cross-functional teams and projects, get your hands dirty in everything, and become well-known to several employees within the company at different levels and departments, especially those at the senior leadership level. Make yourself seen and make your presence felt across different projects. This aligns you for better opportunities within the company, so if it decides to cut a project or department, you have already jumped ship to the right place. We’ve already seen this year how thousands of federal employees have been laid off or been threatened with layoffs if they would not comply with the new in-office working stipulations imposed by the Trump administration. Amazon also began mandating all its employees to work from the office five days a week in January, and other companies have also followed. Therefore, if you work within a large company that traditionally embraces hybrid or in-person work, consider yourself a liability. Even if your role is remote right now, there may come a time where it won’t be that way forever, and you’ll be forced to either switch to working more days or hours in the office, or handing in your notice. The safest way to avoid this while continuing to hold on to your remote working status is to opt into freelancing or independent contractor work, particularly where knowledge-based work is concerned. As a freelance professional, you can work on your own terms, on your own schedule, and from whatever location you please, so long as you get the job done. While many employers view remote workers, deprioritized projects, underperformance, outdated skill sets, and automation as valid reasons to lay off their employees, you don’t need to be affected by these red flags. Now that you know what influences the decisions at the top, you can use the tips and resources to future-proof your career and maintain job stability.

Title: News Influencers Are Reaching Young People, and the Media Is Trying to Keep Up

It’s no surprise that young Americans say social media is their preferred way to get news. But a growing number of them are turning to news influencers — those familiar faces who often share frank, relatable, direct-to-camera videos — to learn about what’s going on. In 2024, a Pew Research study found that about one in five Americans (21%) — including 37% of adults under 30 — said they regularly got news from influencers. Divya Nagarajan, 19, a student at Emory University, says that seeing the same people in her feed makes them feel more trustworthy. “It's kind of like the parasocial thing where it feels like I know them,” she tells Teen Vogue. Nagarajan says she favors the conversational tone news influencers use and the personal feel of their content vs. the onslaught of breaking alerts from legacy outlets. Says Rachel Karten, a social media consultant and author of the Link in Bio newsletter, whether it's TikTok or Instagram, people don’t want to leave the platforms where they already scroll, so you have to meet them where they are: "They're not there necessarily to consume news, but if it comes across their feed, they're going to watch it," she explains. "And they're going to start to maybe grow a connection with the person who is reporting that news.” Relatability, perceived trustworthiness, ease of consumption: These are just some of the reasons young people say they’re turning to these influencer voices. Online-first news outlets like NowThis and AJ+ have long understood this; more traditional outlets, however, have only just started experimenting with what has been called “talent-driven journalism,” hiring news influencers who have a strong personal brand to lead their social presence. Influencers can be a great way to connect with new audiences, but there are concerns that social content creators could be fueling the misinformation crisis. According to Pew, 77% of these influencers have no journalism background or affiliation with a news organization, which means they may not have strict standards for vetting the information they share. The growing interest in hiring or promoting camera-ready creators with a strong personal brand is also troubling for journalists who aren’t particularly interested in being social media stars. Of course, talent-driven journalism isn’t exactly new. From familiar names in print to favorite radio hosts to iconic CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite’s comforting and constant "And that's the way it is" sign-off, people have long preferred voices they recognize. That recognition breeds trust, and it's no different on social media. So some traditional media companies are now bringing influencers in-house, or focusing on growing the followings of in-house creators, to help reach younger audiences. Mayra Báez, an audience strategist and AI consultant, helped launch AJ+, Al Jazeera’s social media news and storytelling project, in 2014, intertwining the outlet’s online brand with journalists' personal brands. In addition to making the news more engaging and approachable, Báez tells Teen Vogue via email, the move put journalists in direct conversation with audiences where they were increasingly spending time: on their phones. “Social media-first newsrooms started doing this over a decade ago; the difference is that legacy media is only now catching up, and not by choice, but out of necessity.” The Washington Post’s social media audience skews younger than its audiences on other platforms, according to the publication’s “TikTok guy” Dave Jorgenson, and audience members feel a personal connection to the account's hosts after seeing them in videos for years. “These people have been with us since they were teenagers, and we take that relationship very seriously,” he says. “We know for a fact that our audience trusts us more because of our presence on TikTok and [YouTube] Shorts.” Jorgenson, who launched the Post’s TikTok channel in 2019, recently spun off a Post-produced series, Local News International, on his personal YouTube channel. The series is designed to be cut down for vertical video and shared on the Post’s other accounts to help grow those audiences. In January, the Post doubled down on its talent-driven strategy, restructuring its public relations division to focus on developing a “star talent unit” — a move that resulted in layoffs at the outlet, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Stay up-to-date with the politics team. Sign up for the Teen Vogue Take Sara Sines, a 24-year-old dancer and performer, says she gets most of her news from influencers on social media, though the content often appears in her feed without her seeking it out. If she recognizes the face of someone whose approach she liked in the past, even if she doesn’t know their name, she stops to hear their take when they pop up on her For You page. For some publishers, social media has been the key to reaching new, younger audience members, like Sines, who may be unfamiliar with an outlet's nonsocial reporting. Morning Brew, which first launched as a business newsletter in 2015, has grown a stand-alone social media audience of millions of followers in part by leaning into creators, says Macy Gilliam, a video producer at the media company. “Young people like to follow people; they don't really like to follow brands,” she notes. "We are people at the brand, so it's kind of like bridging the gap.” Since stepping into an on-camera role two years ago, Gilliam, 24, appears every week in several short videos on Morning Brew’s social channels and has become a recognizable presence. “They'll comment things like, ‘Oh, I love when Macy does this,’ ‘Oh, Macy's always joking about that.’” This familiarity, she says, gives Morning Brew’s audience a stronger affinity for both the creator and the brand. Gilliam, who recently launched a new video franchise under the Morning Brew umbrella, believes introducing creator personalities on an outlet’s existing social channels benefits everyone: In-house influencers bring recognition, personality, and trustworthiness to the brand, creators get the company’s editorial support, and audiences get more engaging content. Talent-driven journalism does present many opportunities. But even as audience strategist Báez acknowledges the positives — news feels more personal, journalists connect directly with an audience, more accessibility, and the chance for people from underrepresented backgrounds to build their own following — she cautions that the practice also poses many challenges for journalists and news-seekers. First, Báez says, social media takes place on “borrowed land,” and is beholden to platforms with changing algorithms that generally deprioritize news. That makes it harder for outlets to ensure their coverage reaches the intended audiences, and for audiences to access the perspectives for which they’re searching. Additionally, Báez points out, not every journalist wants to be a public-facing personality. The shift toward news influencers favors extroverts over highly skilled journalists who do critical behind-the-scenes investigative work. It also increases the likelihood of harassment, burnout, and instability, especially for journalists from marginalized backgrounds. And, as with many shifts in media, this shift favors those who already have social capital, often white, male, well-connected voices, while others still struggle for visibility and support, she explains. Time will tell whether news organizations can invest in influencers to effectively benefit reporters and audiences alike. “Done right, it could strengthen journalism,” says Báez. “Done poorly, it could widen existing inequalities and destabilize an already fragile industry.”

In just four months, Aaron Yang's young career in renewable energy had hit the highs and lows you might expect of a more seasoned worker. Yang, 22, graduated from New York University in December and landed a job at the Department of Energy in an office doling out grants to nascent clean technologies like hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and long-duration battery storage. By April, he had been fired, rehired, and accepted a voluntary buyout under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the federal government. Renewable energy programs were a top target, with Trump on January 20 signing an executive order freezing funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. Since then, thousands of federal employees working on clean energy, environmental justice, and climate science have been terminated. "Throughout college, I worked toward this career path," Yang told Business Insider in April at a career fair in Washington, DC. "Then I got into the DOE and felt that was a huge achievement. So to then immediately get laid off has been tough to reconcile." Yang is among many Gen Zers entering a job market defined by hiring slumps in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. The upheaval in Washington has further clouded their career paths, particularly in the renewable energy industry, as tariffs and frozen federal funding have led companies to delay new projects or scrap them altogether. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited Friday's strong jobs report to say that Trump was bringing jobs back "and making America the world's manufacturing powerhouse once again." A DOE spokesperson told Business Insider that the department was still reviewing its organizational structure to align with the president's priorities. "The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, abundant, and secure American energy," they said, adding, "No final decisions have been made and multiple plans are still being considered." At a job fair during DC's inaugural Climate Week, more than 50 companies and trade associations met some 1,200 job seekers. They lined up to chat with firms including Amazon, the solar manufacturer Qcells, and Arcadia, an AI analytics platform for energy. Zainab Mirza organized the job fair for Clean Energy for America, a trade group that lobbies Congress and the administration on issues like protecting tax credits for renewable energy. Mirza experienced similar career setbacks as Yang. She graduated from American University in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which thwarted her plans to pursue a career in international development overseas. In February, she was laid off from the DOE's Loan Program Office, where she had just become a full-time employee after being a contractor for two years. The slashed investments go beyond the federal government. In the first three months of 2025, companies canceled, closed, or downsized projects totaling nearly $8 billion in investment. This affected 16 new factories for electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen — more than three times the cancellation rate over the previous 30 months, according to an analysis by E2, a business group that advocates for clean energy, and the think tank Atlas Public Policy. "If this self-inflicted and unnecessary market uncertainty continues, we'll almost certainly see more projects paused, more construction halted, and more job opportunities disappear," Michael Timberlake, spokesperson for E2, said in a statement. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the number of new job postings across renewable power — including solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal — dropped by more than 20%, indicating a slowdown in labor demand, an analysis Revelio Labs conducted for BI showed. Some companies continue to invest in the energy transition. In March, 10 solar, EV, and transmission manufacturing plants were announced, which, if built, could create 5,000 permanent jobs. That includes Tesla's plans to build a battery factory near Houston. Despite the hurdles, Mirza was optimistic about the future. While the DOE is expected to be less active and shift away from wind and solar projects, it may help finance nuclear, geothermal, and power grid resilience. Katie Mehnert, CEO of ALLY Energy, an online career and networking platform, said the energy industry is always changing. Mehnert lives in Texas, where layoffs are also hitting the oil and gas sector. The rise of artificial intelligence is ushering in another transformation of how businesses operate. But there will be jobs, Mehnert said. ALLY recently partnered with Parallel, an AI-driven jobs platform that aims to make job hunting more efficient and better match people's expertise to openings. "We need more energy, we need sustainable energy, we need affordable energy," Mehnert said. "And there's plenty of money that's been deployed. Now we need to find the best talent and match them with opportunities quicker. That way, we can minimize the disruption in job marketing and people's personal lives." Mirza, for her part, encouraged young people to be open-minded to positions they may not have considered. "I'm not sure where I want to go next," Mirza said. "I've had a blast putting this event together. I think that people here can meet with employers they might not have heard of or thought about, or a skill that they haven't developed. There are upskilling opportunities. There are incubators. Maybe you've had an idea for so long, and now you can test it out." Yang said he's open-minded, too. Although his time at DOE was focused on long-duration energy storage like batteries, he is open to other technologies. During his undergrad internships, Yang worked on transmission infrastructure, sales teams, and policy development. For now, Yang decided to accelerate his pursuit of a master's in energy, policy, and climate at Johns Hopkins University while looking for a full time job. He's come close several times, but ultimately, someone with more experience was hired. "That's no fault of my own," Yang said. "There are a ton of talented people out there right now, and I haven't worked full-time yet. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know what my future holds." Do you have a story to share?
