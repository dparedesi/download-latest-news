Spending is said to include over 20,000 new American workers and the production of servers in Texas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple today announced a plan to spend $500 billion in the United States in the next four years, including in jobs, suppliers, and building servers. This comes as Apple — like most consumer electronics companies — faces down a threat of tariffs from importing goods and components from China and other countries from President Donald Trump.The company says this is its biggest US-focused spending plan to date. Beyond jobs, it includes paying US-based suppliers, including factories owned by Texas Instruments and TSMC. Apple will build servers for Apple Intelligence at a facility in Houston, and claims it will increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and establish an "academy" in Michigan to "train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering." Following a meeting between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, Trump said that Cook was ceasing plants in Mexico and would increase its spend in the US. “They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” he told U.S. state governors. It's unclear which Mexican facilities Trump was referring to, though Apple supplier Foxconn has some plants there, Bloomberg points out.The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on goods imported from China and has mentioned, but not yet enacted, a 25% tariff on chips.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018 during the first Trump administration, including jobs and a campus in Austin, Texas. It's unclear which, if any, of the investments discussed recently were previously planned prior to Trump entering office for his second term. During the first term, Trump took credit for Apple's Mac Pro plant run by a contractor, which was already in operation.In 2021, Apple announced more U.S.-based spending plans, including a $430 billion investment including a North Carolina campus, as well as jobs in silicon engineering and research and development. (That campus is currently on pause)."We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a press release. Notably, the hiring commitments come at a time when much of big tech is going through layoffs.Cook's plans for US investments helped Apple during Trump's first terms, earning it exceptions from some tariffs on its biggest devices, including the iPhone. This time around, it appears other tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman and former CEO Jeff Bezos, are trying to follow Cook's playbook by cultivating relationships with the president.

Title: ‘They got to get rid of it somehow’: Shopper buys 24-pack of Sprite from Walmart. Then they open up the cans

Stace Fernandez This Walmart shopper found something really strange in her Sprite cans. Now, viewers are starting to speculate. Sprite, known for its iconic lemon-lime flavor, is known to be a clear drink, unlike sodas like Dr.Pepper and Coca-Cola, which are brown, and even ginger ale, which has a slight yellow tinge. That’s why this woman was so freaked out once she started pouring the soda she just bought. In a trending TikTok, Walmart shopper Meagan McGee (@themeaganmcgee) shared the offputting thing she found when she went to open a Sprite. The clip garnered more than 200,000 views total, as it was posted twice. See, her husband just went to Walmart and picked up a 24-pack of Sprite. But when McGee opened one, the liquid inside was a dark brown. Maybe it was a fluke with just one soda being accidentally filled? That doesn’t seem to be the case. McGee had already poured out two cans, and the third had the same contents. “Every single one of these is pouring out Coke. Make it make sense,” McGee says. Now, the most logical explanation is that Coca-Cola and Sprite are owned by the same parent company. A big mistake may have been made during the packing process, and Sprite cans were incorrectly filled. But commenters have their own, potentially less plausible, theories. “I wonder to make up for the difference in sales coke cola is being sold as other products just a hunch,” a person said, referring to the Coke boycotts. “Thanks but i like my soda companies with no ICE,” another added, also in refence to the boycott. “I did some quality work in that industry and there is a way to track back to the technician who signed off for that particular can,” a commenter claimed. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Coca-Cola did donate to Trump. The soda brand was added to this boycott list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. The Daily Dot reached out to McGee for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Coca-Cola via email. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: Review: Space to Grow
URL: https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4940/1
Time Published: 2025-02-24T11:57:00Z
Full Content:
Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier by Matthew Weinzierl and Brendan Rosseau Harvard Business Review Press, 2025 hardcover, 320 pp., illus. ISBN 978-1-64782-716-8 US$32 At Blue Origin, the company with the motto “Gradatim ferociter” or “step by step ferociously,” the steps have been a little more ferocious so far this year. The company finally conducted its first New Glenn orbital launch in January, a mission that was mostly successful other than a failed booster landing. Earlier this month, the company launched its New Shepard suborbital vehicle, demonstrating the ability to provide simulated lunar gravity for the payloads inside for about two minutes. This week, the company will launch another New Shepard carrying six private astronauts. But, earlier this month, the company also announced it was laying off about 10% of its workforce, at least 1,000 employees. Dave Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company had created “more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed” as it grew significantly in recent years. The layoffs were intended to address those concerns, reducing both engineering and management positions. Limp, a longtime Amazon executive, was hired a little more than a year ago by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos to make the company more decisive. ““He said he didn’t think Blue needed another rocket scientist,” Limp said of Bezos at the Commercial Space Conference in Washington a day before he announced the layoffs. “What we needed was a little bit more organization, a little more decisiveness, some manufacturing expertise.” Those events demonstrated that technical success is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success in commercial space: companies, even those backed by billionaires, must eventually demonstrate that they can provide a product that meets the needs of customers and in a way that is financially sustainable. That is at the core of Space to Grow, a new book by Matthew Weinzierl, a professor at Harvard Business School (HBS), and Brendan Rosseau, a former teaching fellow and research associate there. The authors, who created a space economics project at HBS, make clear they see tremendous opportunity for the commercial space industry thanks to the reduced costs to build and launch spacecraft and the growing value of services provided by those satellites in communications, Earth observation, and other sectors. But while they call this a “revolution,” this is book is not an uncritical, overzealous look at the space industry, but one grounded in the rigors of economics. Many of the chapters in the book are case studies of some major space companies: Blue Origin, Planet, SpaceX, and others. Those chapters trace the rise (and sometimes fall: one of the profiled companies is defunct asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources) of these companies, including how they responded to, and sometimes reshaped, the markets. That is tied to what can be considered the book’s central theme, that under certain conditions, markets are efficient. They use economic concepts throughout the book to support their analyses of the companies they profile. Those concepts range from simple supply-and-demand curves to more advanced concepts like the Le Chatelier principle, which explains how decreasing the cost of the supply of a product or service may create only modest increases in demand in the short term, but larger changes in the long term as the market takes more advantage of that less expensive supply. Fortunately, you do not need a background in economics to appreciate that: Weinzierl and Rosseau do a good job explaining those concepts in plain language. They acknowledge that, despite that central theme, markets are not always efficient. They discuss market failures like orbital debris, where there are limited incentives for satellite operators to pay to clean up their defunct satellites, along with regulatory obstacles. They also cite concerns of monopoly power that SpaceX in particular holds in the launch sector; competition, they note, is one of those “certain conditions” required for markets to be efficient. Much of the background about the companies in the book will be familiar to readers, but the economic framing is useful for people inside and outside the industry alike. The authors stop short of making specific recommendations for companies or policymakers, but it’s clear they see potential for efficient markets to enable further growth of the industry. In light of the recent events at Blue Origin, it was worth examining that chapter in detail to review their assessment of the company. A “monumental turning point” for the company, in the words of former president Rob Meyerson, was the decision not to bid on the next phase of NASA’s commercial crew program in 2012 after participating in earlier phases. By doing so, Weinzierl and Rosseau state, Blue Origin was “denying itself the discipline imposed by the market forces that are at the heart of the commercial space revolution’s promise” and acting more like a “philanthropic nonprofit than like a space startup.” That appears to be changing now, both with Blue Origin’s technical accomplishments and its internal shakeups. “We have made a lot of progress in the past year on fundamentals and acting quickly and turning us into a world-class manufacturing company, and focusing the company,” Limp said at the Commercial Space Conference. “I think we’ve made some progress. We have a lot to do this year, too.” Note: the authors provided me with a galley of Space to Grow and requested a blurb about the book, which was included in the published version. That blurb reflected my sincere opinion of the book, described in far greater detail in this review.

Title: Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? - The Pragmatic Engineer
URL: https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T05:47:01Z

Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. This article is an excerpt from last week's The Pulse, issue – full subscribers received the below details seven days ago. To get articles like this in your inbox, subscribe here. Many subscribers expense the newsletter – if you have a learning & development budget, here's an email you could send to your manager. Before we start: despite the below stats, the tech market is not all gloom and doom! This week, we covered pockets of the tech industry that are seeing more demand than before in the issue State of the startup and scaleup hiring markets – as seen by recruiters. Interesting data from jobs site Indeed shows the change in the number of active software developer job listings on the site. For context, Indeed is the largest job aggregator portal in the US and in several countries, and it crawls vacancies on other sites, too. This means that Indeed aims to track most of the posted jobs across a given region (via crawling and processing them) – not just the ones companies pay to post on Indeed. The overall picture looks pretty grim, right now: Since February 2020, Indeed has shared aggregated statistics on the number of active jobs listings, taking January 2020 to be 100%, as a reference. Facts about software developer jobs on Indeed: Indeed tracks international job markets, too. Canada has virtually the same graph as the US. Things are different in the UK, France, Germany, and Australia: Trends look similar across the world. Australia’s growth in software engineer positions is eye-catching because it’s higher, and it’s the only country where the number of jobs listed is not lower than in 2020. Section 174 — the accounting change effective from 2023, mandating software engineering costs to be amortised over 5 years is most likely to result in fewer software developer jobs in the US, as we have previously analyzed. The drop in jobs somewhat lines up with when this change became effective. However, Section 174 only impacts the US and US-headquarters companies. its impact would only be visible from early 2024 — and the drop since 2022 can in no way be attributed to it. Section 174 changes also do not explain why countries the UK and France see a similar drop in job postings. This suggests that although Section 174 changes in the US surely have an impact: this accounting rule change is not the main driver of this drop. What about the number of total jobs in other industries? The data: Across Indeed, 10% more jobs are listed today in February 2025 than were in February 2020. There are 35% fewer listings for software developers. Let’s dig a little deeper into which other industries are also experiencing a drop: The change in the number of listings in 2025, compared to 2020, for each of these areas: Hospitality and tourism openings are also down by 18%. Overall, software developer jobs have seen the biggest boom and bust in vacancies. No other segment saw hiring more than double in 2022; only banking came close. At the same time, hiring has fallen faster in software development in the last 2-3 years than anywhere else So, which areas have grown since 2020? Several sectors saw job listings go up, significantly: Growth rates compared to five years ago: The numbers don’t lie, job listings for devs have plummeted. There’s a few potential reasons why: Interest rate changes explain most of the drop. The end of zero percent interest rates is a mega-trend that affects many things across the economy since 2022, including hiring, the steep fall in VC funding, and how many tech startups survive, thrive, or die. But it doesn’t explain why highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon or Google have slowed down their hiring, or the large layoffs in recent years at tech’s biggest workplaces. The tech sector seems to react to sudden events with more intensity than any other industry. There is no other industry that started to hire in the frenzy than the tech industry did in 2022 – and then no other industry cut back hiring in 2024-2025. Let’s compare it with the industry that had the second-largest hiring boom during COVID: banking and finance. The job posting slowdown could partially be explained by how much more tech companies hired during the pandemic-era boom, and that companies are well-staffed thanks to that boom. Of course, we cannot deny that developer jobs – as well as banking jobs – are underperforming, compared to job listings across the economy: GenAI impact – yay or nay? We know first-hand that coding is an area in which Large Language Models are really helpful. Indeed, would it be so surprising if coding goes on to become the single best area of all that LLMs thrive in? The discipline looks tailor-made for it: Could tech companies be hiring less thanks to anticipating productivity boost that GenAI tools could bring for existing engineers? I don’t really buy this logic: but I can see how several companies could do a “wait and see” approach, slowing down hiring or even pausing it while they gather more data. A perception that engineering is no longer a bottleneck could be a reason for lower hiring. As covered in January, Salesforce will keep software engineering headcount flat because it’s seen a 30% productivity gain from AI tools. Salesforce has an interest in making AI productivity sound compelling because it sells an AI offering called Agentforce, and the company can afford to hire 1,000 additional salespeople to sell its new products it’s built. This suggests there’s substance in the reported productivity gain; Salesforce might be building software faster than it can sell it. Playing the devil’s advocate, this also raises the possibility that Salesforce isn’t building the right products, if it needs to hire more agents to sell its products, despite already having a strong distribution network and partnerships. Still too many engineers, after overrecruitment in 2021-2022? The period was the hottest tech jobs market of all time, and companies hired at a record pace. In 2023, widespread layoffs followed. Sluggish hiring today could be an indicator that companies still have enough “excess hires” from 2022. Perhaps some companies feel they hired too quickly before, and are going slower now. Are smaller teams more efficient? The two companies below hire slowly, and have small engineering teams: Could we be approaching the point at which building products is simpler to do for one or two engineers? Not because of LLMs, but how languages like Typescript allow working across the backend and frontend (using e.g. Node.js on the backend and React and React Native on the frontend and web). Of course, LLMs make onboarding to different stacks easier than ever. Consider how Indeed job postings will not be fully accurate data. There is a fair chance that Indeed is becoming less popular as a destination to post jobs – especially software engineering jobs – and that Indeed is either not crawling, or banned from crawling them. For example, Indeed lists a total of 663 jobs from Microsoft – however, Microsoft has more than 1,000 jobs just with the words “software” in them listed. I also struggled to find several startup jobs advertised on sites like Workatastartup (the job board for Y Combinator companies) listed on Indeed. I suspect that Indeed’s data should be directionally correct, and there are indeed fewer developer job listings than before. But I don’t think this data is representative enough of startup hiring, and it probably doesn’t track Big Tech hiring all that well either. Data shows that in 2023, the number of software engineers dropped for the first time in 20 years, fuelled by layoffs. It’s predicted that growth in the tech industry is likely to be low this year, and most certainly well below growth between 2011-2021 growth. I see a few possibilities: Smaller engineering teams get more productive. This is the optimistic outlook, where LLMs add a big boost to both individual and team productivity, which leads to more engineering teams being spun up, across the industry. More startups could be founded, and traditional companies could bring development in-house. The industry stagnates / shrinks. In this pessimistic outlook, even as software becomes cheaper to produce with fewer engineers needed, companies produce the same software, but with fewer people. This also assume entrepreneurs will not jump at the opportunity to build their ideas more efficiently – and much cheaper than before! I cannot see the scenario of the shrinking industry playing out – not with good software missing from so many parts of the world, and building better software being a big business opportunity in some many other industries. LLMs make software development more accessible for non-developers: I’m sure that LLMs are a leading cause of the fall in software developer job postings: there’s uncertainty at large companies about whether to hire as fast as previously, given the productivity hype around AI tooling, and businesses are opting to “wait and see” by slowing down recruitment, as a result. Startups are finding that smaller teams are working fine, and that it pays off to hire slower – as Linear and Bluesky are doing – and to avoid the “hyperscaling” approach of hiring first and asking what the new workers will actually do, later. Big Tech will hire slower than before, and I don’t see startups speeding up hiring. What’s missing is an answer to the question: how much new software will be created by non-developers using AI tools, for which a lot more developers will be needed to grow and maintain those new solutions?

Title: Software engineering job openings hit 5-year low amid industry shift

Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent). The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak. Trend in software development job postings in various countries - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz. He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring. Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a "wait and see" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams. Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople. The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes. All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings - Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data. So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

Title: The best trade in the market might be following everything Elon Musk touches

Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market. In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade. Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump. Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists. Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block. But first, Musk is having a moment. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk. In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.) You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump. But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart. Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7. The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period. Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks. While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly. There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman. A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.) More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be "unfair" to the US. Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country. And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform. In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them. BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference. 1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans. 2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday. 3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods. 1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides "variable cash incentives" designed to "motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements," per a SEC filing. 2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies. 3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval. 1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion. 2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: "Who'd you pick as the next Bond?" 3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

Title: Cameo is giving workers a $10,000 raise to return to the office. Its CEO says they're paying more because they're asking for more.

The celebrity video messaging company Cameo this week rolled out $10,000 raises for employees returning to work in-office four days a week at its Chicago headquarters. CEO Steven Galanis told Business Insider the raises and other perks announced this week — such as catered lunch, paid parking, and a free gym membership — have immediately boosted productivity and recruitment efforts. Chicago-based workers all attended the first four required days in office without absences, they completed more sales outreach together in just a few days than they had in the previous six months, and the move has helped them recruit new employees, he said. "It's been pretty amazing to watch the reception that we've seen from applicants," Galanis said. "People are coming out of the woodwork that want to work for us now, and ex-employees want to come back, which is awesome." Cameo, which has gone through three rounds of highly publicized and contentious layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic, now employs 50 people, with about half living in the Chicago area, Galanis said. Those who don't live within commuting distance of Chicago aren't eligible for the raise unless they move there, and will not be required to report to the office, he said. If Cameo sets up satellite locations in other cities in the future, Galanis said the option for an in-office work raise would apply to them, as well. Galanis said he believes the company thrives on in-office brainstorming and participation, but he wanted to try to lure his workers back into the company headquarters organically. "We really wanted this to be a FOMO-inducing perk versus a punishment," Galanis said."I believe if we're requiring you to come in four days a week, we are literally asking more out of you than if you didn't have to. So, to me, if we're asking more out of you, it totally makes sense that we should pay you more." The $10,000 raise stands in contrast to other companies' RTO mandates, though Galanis said he has a preference for in-office collaboration shared by many top executives. JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, last week made headlines for a viral, expletive-laden rant against working from home. In it, he said he didn't care how many of the banking giant's employees signed a petition against its five-day return-to-office mandate that takes effect next month. "Don't waste time on it," Dimon said. "I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition." Other major companies, such as Starbucks, have threatened employees with termination if they refuse to comply with RTO orders, Bloomberg first reported in October. Still, some major return-to-office rollouts have been bumpy. As Business Insider previously reported, Amazon delayed its RTO initiative for some employees because it didn't have enough workspace for returning employees. Galanis said he understands the vitriol over working from home espoused by some executives — "what Jamie said is something that myself and many other CEOs have felt before or talked about behind closed doors," he said — and he gets the need for some extra large companies to be more strict in their approach to returning to the office. That just wasn't for him, he said. "I can't judge what's the right thing for another company's culture," Galanis said. "But I know the way our company is, and I know how much we cherish our employees and so this, for us, was the right approach." Jump to

Title: Tech’s Revolving Door of Layoffs Shatters Worker Trust

Once a beacon of stability and lavish perks, the tech industry is now a minefield of layoffs, leaving workers disillusioned and employers scrambling to retain talent. In the past week, Meta Platforms Inc., Workday Inc., and OpenText Corp. joined a parade of firms cutting thousands of jobs—over 6,500 since February 13—adding to a 2025 toll exceeding 10,800. Repeated downsizings, often paired with soaring profits, have “severed trust” between tech workers and their bosses, as employees question the loyalty once taken for granted in Silicon Valley. The latest salvo began February 10, when Meta axed 3,600 jobs—5% of its workforce—targeting “low performers,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s memo, reported by Bloomberg. Workday followed on February 12, slashing 1,750 roles to fund AI initiatives, while OpenText cut 1,200 on February 13 to trim costs. Alphabet Inc.’s Google offered voluntary exits in its Platforms & Devices unit, and Microsoft Corp., Salesforce Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. pruned staff across divisions, from underperformers to sustainability teams. Salesforce’s over-1,000 cuts came even as it hires for AI roles, per company statements. This isn’t a one-off. Meta’s latest purge follows a December 2024 cut of 5%, part of a 24,000-job reduction since 2022. Amazon aims to shed 14,000 managerial roles by spring, and Intel Corp.’s 15,000 layoffs last year remain a stark benchmark. On X, @JimJeffery11 dubbed it “private-sector ruthlessness,” a sentiment echoing through posts as workers lament the shift from tech’s cushy past. The erosion stems from a toxic mix of broken promises and cold pragmatism. Tech workers, lured by free meals and stock options, once saw their employers as partners in a grand mission. Now, they’re expendable. “I don’t trust employers anymore,” Eliot Lee, a 52-year-old project manager laid off multiple times, told The Washington Post last week. His story resonates: despite glowing reviews, workers at Meta and elsewhere find themselves blindsided, venting on X about “sudden betrayals.” Profits only deepen the rift. Meta’s stock rose 3% post-layoffs, and Microsoft boasts a $3 trillion valuation, yet cuts persist. X user @CPA_jjones on February 19 framed it as “remixing staff for efficiency,” not necessity—a view bolstered by a World Economic Forum survey predicting 41% of firms will shrink workforces due to AI within five years. Companies tout AI and cost-cutting, but employees see greed. “They’re thriving, yet we’re disposable,” tweeted @gamefrenza on February 15. Transparency—or its absence—fuels the fire. Google’s voluntary exits and Meta’s performance purges lack the decorum of past “restructurings,” as @gkcs_ noted on X. Workers feel like cogs in a machine, a far cry from the “family” rhetoric of the 2010s. The fallout is palpable. A Washington Post report on February 10 cited studies showing repeated layoffs erode morale, stifle innovation, and push survivors to disengage. Meta staffers, some axed despite high ratings, flooded social media with disbelief, per posts tracked this week. “Trust is gone,” one anonymous employee wrote on X, echoing a broader sentiment: 60% of laid-off techies distrust future employers, per a 2023 Tech.co survey still relevant today. The job market offers little solace. While IT and finance hiring ticks up, per @CPA_jjones, competition is fierce—over 1,000 applicants vie for single roles, Lee noted. Daelynn Moyer, 55, laid off from Indeed last year, has applied to 140 jobs without success, contemplating a farming pivot, per the Post. Visa holders like Chicago-based engineer Mittal face deportation if unhired within 60 days, adding urgency to the chaos, per CNBC. Companies aren’t immune. Distrust breeds turnover—remaining staff quietly quit or jump ship, as Patrick McAdams of recruiting firm Andiamo told the Post. Innovation suffers when fear replaces boldness, a risk for an industry banking on AI breakthroughs. On X, @NewstalkZB speculated Meta’s cuts “make way for AI,” but at what cost? Firms like SAP SE and PayPal Holdings Inc., launching AI-driven platforms this week, may outpace rivals slow to adapt, yet talent wars loom if workers balk at instability. Tech’s cultural shift compounds the problem. Gone are the Lizzo concerts Google once hosted, per a 2022 WSJ piece; now, desk-sharing and austerity rule. “Efficiency over ethics,” @gamefrenza quipped in Spanish and English, capturing a global view of tech’s new ethos. The bleeding may continue—45% of U.S. managers foresee AI-driven cuts this year, per a recent business study. Yet glimmers of resilience emerge. Pulsant’s UK data-center expansion and Bharti Airtel’s subsea cable, announced this week, signal infrastructure bets. Hiring persists in AI niches, and startups like Monomi Park are scooping up Big Tech castoffs, per a 2022 WIRED note still relevant. For workers, upskilling is survival. Amber Adamson, laid off from Covetrus, is honing coding skills, per a 2023 Washington Post story echoing today’s reality. Employers must rebuild trust—transparency, not platitudes, is key. As Samaraweera, ex-Jellysmack, told NBC last year, “Tech doesn’t seem safe anymore.” In 2025, that’s the industry’s stark truth—and its urgent challenge.

Title: Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fund big AI bets

Good morning! A fully remote job where you're left alone and get paid up to $30 an hour. Interested? Training AI might be the gig for you. In today's big story, BI obtained a leaked recording of an Amazon all-hands showing how the tech giant plans to cut costs so it can make big bets. What's on deck Markets: Investors are getting cocky about the stock market, and that could be a red flag. Tech: Why Microsoft's quantum 'breakthrough' is so important. Business: This EV maker was once more valuable than Ford. Now it's bankrupt. But first, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Big Tech is on a cost-cutting spree to fuel its endless appetite for big AI bets. Amazon is the latest tech giant trying to find the sweet spot between saving money and not shying away from making big bets. The company's retail CEO, Doug Herrington, told employees to keep reducing costs so it can fund "big investments in big new businesses," according to a recording of last month's internal all-hands meeting that Business Insider's Eugene Kim obtained. In an ideal world, companies' big bets can save them money in the long run. Amazon's investments in AI and warehouses have helped it lower the costs of fulfilling customers' orders. Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, Tye Brady, spoke to Eugene about the progress made there. Finding the balance between savings and innovation is key. Herrington told employees every team should simultaneously look to reduce costs and develop new ideas. Gail Carpenter, Amazon's retail CFO, also described how cost-cutting is part of a wider formula, not a one-way street. "As a reminder, this work isn't just about cost reduction — it enables us to invest in a better customer experience," she said in the meeting. Companies' big bets can take a while to pay off, though. AI projects aren't cheap, from hardware and data center needs to the talent to get it up and running. And while expectations are high for AI's impact, those benefits haven't fully materialized. In the meantime, tech companies can't afford to take their foot off the gas, lest they risk falling behind competitors. And if the big bets aren't helping companies save money yet, they'll need to look elsewhere. Amazon has laid off at least 27,000 people since late 2022 and shrunk less profitable businesses like its fashion and fitness program. Meta, which hasn't backed down from its massive tech budget, has also taken steps to cut spending while remaining aggressive on the AI front. The company recently cut thousands of underperformers, taking a page from Amazon's playbook, while simultaneously ramping up hiring machine-learning engineers. The government is employing fewer people and they're traveling less. United Airlines could lose millions of dollars. 1. Are we too confident in the stock market? Good news: Americans are actually feeling hopeful about the market. Bad news: We need a healthy dose of skepticism to watch out for risks. The confidence investors are feeling about stocks could quickly turn to arrogance, leaving them exposed. 2. Breaking up with Bumble. The dating app's stock plummeted on Wednesday following its latest earnings report, which forecasted lower-than-expected sales. Since its 2021 IPO, Bumble has lost over 90% of its market value. Shifting habits and app fatigue are problems for dating platforms, perhaps lowering how much users are willing to pay for Bumble's service. 3. Palantir's stock slumps. Shares of the software company, which is a major US defense contractor, tanked 10% after reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered budget cuts. The slump ended a four-day winning streak for Palantir, whose stock had, until Wednesday, surged 65% this year. 1. Hey, Siri. Tell me about the new $599 iPhone with AI. Apple announced its budget-friendly iPhone 16e, available to preorder on Friday. The phone is complete with Apple Intelligence and an Action button for shortcuts. After a rocky period for iPhone sales, a cheaper version is Apple's chance to attract new customers with its new AI features. 2. There are no guarantees in the world of startups, but these companies are good bets. Silicon Valley's past few years have been filled with cost-cutting and layoffs, but AI has brought excitement back to the industry. BI compiled 43 startups — focused on everything from women's health to security — worth betting your career on. 3. Microsoft's quantum "breakthrough." Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter. "Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed," CEO Satya Nadella said. The development is "just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor," a quantum expert told BI. 1. Monopolies and murder. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was accused and charged in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't focus too much on the quality of healthcare in the US. Instead, the note largely discusses the size of its parent company, UnitedHealth Group. In other words, Mangione seemed to be angry about monopolization — and it points to a very real trend: American business is bigger than ever. 2. Big Tech's data centers have a pollution problem. The solution could be to bury it. AI data centers are still largely powered by fossil fuels despite promises of leveraging renewable or low-carbon energy sources. Big Tech is now exploring carbon capture, which essentially means burying carbon emissions underground. It's not a new technique, but it's both costly and complex. 3. Another EV startup runs out of charge. Electric-truck startup Nikola filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The truck maker rode a wave of enthusiasm when it went public in 2020 and was once worth more than Ford. However, the startup was later engulfed in a high-profile fraud scandal and ultimately failed to commercialize its tech. It's the latest once-promising EV startup to collapse.
