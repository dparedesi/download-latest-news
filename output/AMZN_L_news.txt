In 2023, a Microsoft employee asked to take on a lighter workload when his wife was found to have terminal cancer. His managers were supportive, and they appeared happy with his performance during his wife's illness as recently as late 2024, when they told him to expect 120% of his bonus. Then, on January 22, the employee said, an HR representative unexpectedly joined his weekly manager meeting. The employee was fired without severance and was told his health insurance would expire that night. The employee's wife had to skip chemotherapy treatments for a month after. "I'm still shocked," he told Business Insider in a recent interview. "Shocked and angry. I did everything right." The Microsoft employee asked not to be identified to protect future career prospects. BI has verified his identity and confirmed details of his performance, his termination, and his wife's illness through documentation. A Microsoft spokesperson, Frank Shaw, said performance-based terminations rarely come as a surprise to employees and people could elect to have COBRA coverage. This person is one of nearly 2,000 fired by Microsoft in January and February in a culling of those deemed low performers, according to a person familiar with the cuts. This kind of performance-based mass cut is a shift for the tech giant, which continues to review the approach. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as the company considers changes to its performance review and management process, several people with knowledge of the plans said. "We aspire to have a high-performance culture and want to make sure managers have the ability to drive that and that expectations are clear," Shaw said, adding that the company wasn't trying to design a tougher system, but one that removes ambiguity, provides clarity and flexibility, and allows managers and teams to move with speed. Microsoft's new approach to performance management is shaping up to be one of the biggest changes to the company's management strategy since Satya Nadella became CEO more than a decade ago. Before he arrived in 2014, Microsoft had a reputation for a cutthroat performance-review system, at least in a tech industry that often mollycoddled talented employees. Nadella softened that considerably. Microsoft once had a reputation for a "country club" culture, as Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, called it, a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. Now, some leaders worry the company has gotten too soft, making it difficult to shed underperformers, according to the people familiar with Microsoft's plans. The company is looking to new external leaders, such as the former Google executive Mustafa Suleyman and a former Meta engineering chief, Jay Parikh, along with existing executives like the company's senior leadership team and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, to help design a new way to evaluate employees, these people said. Microsoft has had an incredibly successful decade, becoming a leading cloud provider and AI player. It's worth about $3 trillion, making the software giant the third-largest company by that measure. The stock has stagnated over the past year, however, as questions mount about the company's Copilot technology, and as AI competition intensifies. The broader tech industry is facing other challenges, and Microsoft is not immune. A decadelong hiring boom has fizzled as companies focus more on profit, and AI coding tools reduce competition for software engineering talent. Meta recently cut about 5% of its workforce to "raise the bar on performance management." Amazon is culling managers. Even Google is trimming jobs. Employees who were let go in Microsoft's recent round of performance cuts got termination letters explaining the abrupt exit. "The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position," said the letters, which BI viewed. "You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft." The letters mentioned severance but said medical, prescription, and dental benefits ended on the last day of employment. The letters also said Microsoft would consider past performance and termination if the person applied for other jobs at the company in the future. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," a company spokesperson told BI recently. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." Deena Merlen, a partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told BI her law firm had received more inquiries about performance-based layoffs as of late. "Employers generally have the right to fire, just as an employee has the right to quit," she said. "As long as Microsoft's alleged performance-based reasons are not for some other, unlawful reason, Microsoft is within its rights to engage in these layoffs." The company has no obligation to provide severance, but such agreements often come with a release of legal claims that can protect the company from lawsuits, Merlen added. Before 2014, Microsoft used a controversial system to evaluate employee performance. Called stack ranking, it forced managers to put employees on a curve and cut the lowest performers. At Microsoft, that meant managers had to rank employees from 1 to 5, and someone always had to get a 5, the lowest score, no matter how well they or the team performed. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said that the system was especially problematic for small teams and that while terminating the lowest rung was not a companywide policy, it happened on some teams. Stack ranking was unpopular internally and was seen as prioritizing individual work, pitting employees against one another and creating a barrier to collaboration. Developers and even entire organizations had a tendency to reject acceptable solutions to problems if they hadn't developed those solutions themselves, the company's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, previously told BI. There's even a famous cartoon depicting Microsoft's org chart as warring factions. The company officially abandoned stack ranking just before Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014. He redesigned the company's performance-review system around the "growth mindset" concept. The idea is that skills are developed through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a "fixed mindset," which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure. Nadella and his new leadership team applied this growth mindset to a new framework called "model, coach, care," which called on managers to set a positive example for employees, help staffers adapt and learn, and invest in people's professional growth. Instead of ranking employees from 1 to 5, Microsoft moved to a performance-review system that gives managers a simple payroll budget they could divide and dole out to employees based on performance. Kevin Oakes, the CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, has worked with Microsoft on implementing a growth mindset. He told BI this approach was a way to encourage top performers but noted that even companies like Microsoft need to cull their workforces to become leaner and higher performing. "Any high-performing organization should make sure employees are performing at an acceptable level, and they should be weeding out people who are not performing at an acceptable level," he said. "Over time, you tend to get a little bloated as a big company where you've let hiring go unchecked in some areas and need to get back to a lean, efficient machine." Today, employees are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 200 called the "ManageRewards slider." The process begins with frontline managers, who evaluate an employee's impact and recommend where they think they should land on the slider. Then, a higher-level manager considers "differentiation" — i.e., making sure the team is distributed along the slider. The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses. A score of "Impact 60," for example, generally gives employees 0% of their stock award and 30% of their maximum cash bonuses while the slightly higher rating of "Impact 80" gives them 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said 100 would be considered a good score and mean an employee had met all of their objectives. In general, the company's senior leadership team gives managers a budget that allows for every employee on the team an average score of 109. "So you want to pay someone impact 140 for doing an outstanding job? Find 3 people you're giving Impact 100 so it's affordable," one executive-level manager explained. "Keep this guy around. He'll be paying for everyone's bonuses." The manager said they typically had paid top performers by finding a set of people who failed in the previous year and giving them all zero or reduced rewards. This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. "That's a bad manager," Shaw said. "You certainly can't give everybody high rewards," but you can give one person high rewards and the rest of the people around 100. While low rewards can indicate a performance issue, Microsoft's actual system for managing out low performers is separate from this employee-rating process. Generally, managers email an internal system called AskHR@ and request a consultation for performance concerns, and the manager will be matched with an internal consultant. More seasoned consultants are used for higher-level employees, or if the situation is difficult. These consultants give written formal feedback to employees, saying they delivered "Less Impact than Expected" and start a three-month performance-management process. Some managers can cut low performers who don't improve within about four months through this process. But sometimes Microsoft's HR department concludes that managers haven't done enough performance coaching, one manager said, meaning they have not generated enough documentation showing employees have been given the opportunity to improve and have repeatedly failed. It can take two or three more 90-day programs before these employees are ousted. One high-level manager said the average time to exit a low performer was seven months from the time a manager notified HR about the situation, which often comes after sustained low performance. "It takes too long to performance-manage folks out," one executive said. These exits can be further delayed by leaves of absence. One of the Microsoft managers who talked to BI said employees sometimes shared tips on how to complicate the company's performance-improvement process. One common suggestion: If your manager is working to fire you, go to a doctor and say you have certain symptoms, get a supporting letter, and secure health-related time off work. This can pause or reset aspects of the process, this person said. Short-term paid disability typically covers 60 to 90 days away from work, and Microsoft's HR department can be reluctant to exit these employees for some time after that, the person said. "For employees gaming the short-term disability policies, you can be talking 12 to 18 months to get to a point where HR is comfortable firing them," they added. In the US, a common refrain for the 0-to-200 performance reviews was, "One Year, One Reward," meaning employees are judged on a single year's performance. The separation between rewards and the formal performance-management process gave flexibility to managers to "harvest the budget," as one manager said, in other words give lower ratings to relatively adequate performers so big rewards could be doled out to high performers. They could do this without much risk to the employment status of the adequate performers. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said this was not company policy. Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, in an internal email in 2023 instructed managers to give fewer employees "exceptional rewards," meaning a high performance rating that leads to higher pay and bonuses. "More will need to be at the middle of the range," Hogan said in the email. Shaw, the spokesperson, said the email was specific to that year and that rewards changed annually based on factors like the economy and company performance. Changes to this year's rewards cycle won't be solidified until later in the year, he said. "Microsoft just summarily terminated hundreds of employees who had year-over-year insufficient performance based on rewards, without a lengthy documentation and feedback process," one executive said, adding that this coming rewards season would be more difficult on managers, who would have to be more careful about doling out low rewards. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, confirmed that the decisions about whom to cut came from looking at rewards year over year but said the company still believed in "one year, one reward." Just because an employee gets high rewards one year, for example, doesn't mean they've earned it the next. As Microsoft evaluates its performance-review process, people familiar with the plans say the company is looking for perspectives from new leaders such as Suleyman, the former Google executive who is now Microsoft's CEO of AI, and Parikh, the former head of engineering at Meta who runs AI platforms at Microsoft. Shaw said that Suleyman and Parikh were just some of the people providing perspective and that Roslansky, the LinkedIn CEO, had also provided a lot of input. "The company will have a much stronger point of view, like some of our competitors," one Microsoft executive said. The company is making other changes to prioritize engineering talent and level out organizations, taking a page from Amazon. Separate from its performance-management processes, Microsoft is starting to weigh how it can become leaner and more engineering-focused. The company measures what it calls "good attrition," which is reviewed at the executive level, the Microsoft executive said. That's reminiscent of Amazon's "unregretted attrition." Right now there are no targets for this Microsoft metric. But the company is borrowing from Amazon in trying to increase the ratio of engineers working on projects. Amazon has something called the "Builder Ratio," which analyzes the ratio of software engineers to "non-builders," such as program managers and project managers. The goal is to try to keep organizations lean. Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss who came from Amazon's cloud unit, has brought this metric to Microsoft. Microsoft tracks the "PM ratio" which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers, and has increased targets in the current fiscal year. For example, Bell's security organization right now is around 5.5 engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach 10:1, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans. Have a tip?

Title: JioStar Employees with Rs 1 Crore+ Salaries Seek Jobs Amid Massive Layoffs
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-jiostar-employees-with-₹1-crore-salaries-seek-jobs-amid-massive-layoffs/

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India JioStar is laying off more than 1,100 employees to eliminate overlapping job positions following the merger between Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Viacom18 and The Walt Disney Company’s India division, according to a report by LiveMint. The layoff drive includes job losses for entry-level employees, senior managers, directors, and even those at the assistant vice president level. “The departures started a month ago, and they are not ending anytime soon,” said one of the people quoted in LiveMint’s report. The downsizing will continue until June and will primarily focus on corporate-level positions in JioStar’s distribution, finance, commercial, and legal departments, according to people interviewed by LiveMint. This move comes at a time when JioStar is targeting to increase the efficiency of its operations and focus on high-growth verticals—specifically digital streaming and sports. “Whenever two large companies with similar businesses merge, redundancies are inevitable,” an industry executive told LiveMint. “This restructuring is about optimizing resources and reducing duplication, ensuring the joint venture operates as a leaner and more efficient entity,” they added. A rival media company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) confirmed that they have been receiving resumes from JioStar employees—many of whom have annual salaries exceeding Rs 1 crore—ready to make the switch. However, the laid-off employees will receive a severance package from JioStar, which is a silver lining: affected workers will receive six to twelve months’ salary as part of the payout plan. The company will provide employees with one full month’s salary for every year they have worked, in addition to a notice period of one to three months. For example, an employee who has worked for less than six years will receive a minimum of seven months’ pay and benefits, including the notice period. Meanwhile, those with longer tenures at the company will receive up to 15 months of compensation. Even employees who have not completed the compulsory five-year period for gratuity eligibility will receive a pro-rata payout. On the other hand, some affected employees, specifically from tech and digital services, will reportedly get jobs within Jio or the wider Reliance ecosystem. The only unaffected department when it comes to the current job cuts at JioStar is the sports department, as the media giant plans to expand its sports portfolio and launch new sports channels. For context, JioStar currently offers broadcast and online streaming of the ICC Champions Trophy, the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the FIH Hockey Pro League, the Premier League, and the Indian Super League, on its Star Sports TV channels and JioHotstar streaming platform. This offering will further expand in about two weeks’ time as the Indian Premier League (IPL) – which is scheduled to take place over two months – kicks off on March 22. As a result, there won’t be any panic about job losses or layoffs in its sports department for now. JioStar’s sports portfolio expansion aligns with the company’s 2023 strategy, when its JioCinema platform secured exclusive streaming rights for the IPL from the now-defunct Disney+ Hotstar. In a similar vein the streaming platform carried out another invaluable coup when it agreed a deal with Warner Bros. to stream its entire content library after Disney+ Hotstar chose not to renew its contract. At the end of the day, JioStar’s overarching aim with all these acquisitions is to rival and eventually marginalise streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in the Indian online streaming market.

Title: Amazon-Owned One Medical CEO Trent Green to Move to NRC Health
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2025/amazon-owned-one-medical-ceo-trent-green-move-nrc-health/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T20:42:16Z

The CEO of Amazon-owned One Medical, Trent Green, will leave that position to become CEO of National Research Corporation, a publicly traded provider of healthcare solutions doing business as NRC Health. NRC Health announced the move in a Wednesday (March 5) press release, saying Green will join the company June 1. Green will leave One Medical April 4, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing an internal Amazon memo. “After nearly three years with Amazon One Medical, CEO Trent Green has decided to leave the company,” an Amazon spokesperson said, per the report. “We are grateful to Trent for his many contributions and wish him well on his next endeavor.” Green became CEO of One Medical in September 2023, about six months after Amazon completed its acquisition of the company, according to the report. During his time in that role, One Medical, which is a primary care provider, expanded into new geographic areas, opened more offices, and integrated further into Amazon, in part by offering services for Prime members, per the report. At NRC Health, which provides a healthcare experience management platform, Green will use his experience in care delivery, digital transformation and strategic business execution to advance the company’s personalized, data-driven solutions and strengthen its market presence, according to the press release. “I am excited to join NRC Health and lead the company during this transformative period,” Green said in the release. “I look forward to working alongside NRC’s talented associates to advance innovative solutions that enhance healthcare experiences for patients, providers and caregivers and drive sustainable growth for our investors.” When Amazon announced its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in July 2022, it said it aimed to reinvent healthcare and described One Medical as a tech-powered primary care provider that offers in-person, digital and virtual care services. It was reported in February 2024 that Amazon was cutting “a few hundred” jobs across its healthcare units One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy while working to save another $100 million in 2024 and decrease its operating losses.

Title: Trump's speech to Congress and Border Patrol agents hit with lawsuit: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump celebrates his first weeks back in office in a speech to Congress. Border Patrol agents are accused of targeting people based on their skin color during a “fishing expedition.” And director Bong Joon-ho talks about his upcoming movie, “Mickey 17.” Here’s what to know today. Donald Trump touted the first weeks of his second term as president as a ringing success in a speech before a joint session of Congress, declaring "America is back" and that his administration has "accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years." Republicans showered Trump with applause as he touched on his economic plans, culture war issues, immigration and more. Democrats demonstrated that they are not as impressed. Though mostly silent, one representative, Al Green of Texas, shouted at Trump until he was removed from the House chamber (See video of the interruption). Trump taunted Democrats for not applauding him and repeated his derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, “Pocahontas,” when talking about Ukraine. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Trump’s speech, which at an hour and 40 minutes was the longest speech ever delivered by a president to Congress, covered a variety of topics. Here are a few highlights: → On the economy, Trump acknowledged that newly imposed tariffs could cause pain for Americans. “A little disturbance,” he said, “but we’re OK with that.” He also renewed his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay — even though the budget that the House passed last month would make room only for extending the tax cuts from his first term. → On foreign policy, Trump pledged to sign a deal that would give the U.S. mineral rights in Ukraine, though his discussion of the war was relatively short despite it dominating the White House’s agenda in recent days. He also said Secretary of State Marco Rubio would oversee efforts to regain control of the Panama Canal and invited Greenland to join the U.S. “if you choose.” → On immigration, Trump said he is waging the “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.” He also highlighted the passage of the Laken Riley Act. → Missing from the speech was any mention of the thousands of federal workers who have been fired since Trump has taken office. However, he mentioned Elon Musk several times and claimed without evidence that he had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” in the government. Read the full story here. Less than a day after new tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China took effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. An interim agreement with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as today, Lutnick said yesterday in an interview on Fox Business Network, and allow tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be rolled back to some degree. Reaction to the tariffs — 25% on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada and additional 10% on all imports from China — was swift, with economists and companies warning about the potential wide-ranging implications: 🚗 The price of cars could increase, even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. 🏠 The cost of building a new home could rise by as much as $10,000 per house, an economist said, which would impact the real estate market as a whole. 🛍️ Target and Best Buy have warned of price hikes, though some businesses have vowed to hold the line on costs. China and Canada have already imposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would respond by Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said imposing tariffs “is a very dumb thing to do.” Read the full story here. Border Patrol agents are accused of carrying out a “fishing expedition” in Kern County, California, allegedly targeting people of a certain color in a search for criminal immigrants, making arrests without warrants and using trickery to get people to leave the country, according to a recent lawsuit. Border Patrol said that 60 agents arrested 78 people, all who were unlawfully in the U.S. in the three-day operation. However, attorneys said some of the people arrested had no criminal convictions. On. Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, a 44-year-old U.S. citizen and resident of Bakersfield for 20 years, after they blocked his truck, slashed his tires, and dragged a passenger from the truck. The same day, Yolanda Agiulera Martinez, a 56-year-old lawful permanent resident was ordered out of her car and thrown to the ground before she was arrested. After she showed agents a photo of her legal residency card, she was told to “get the f--- out of here,” according to the lawsuit. The arrests have left many people in the Latino-majority county traumatized, attorneys said. Read the full story here. “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho returns with his signature blend of drama and absurdist comedy with “Mickey 17.” The film, out Friday, stars Robert Pattinson as an “expendable” — a worker who takes on potentially fatal assignments during an expedition to a new planet, with the expectation of being cloned if he dies. Bong, who speaks Korean, talks about how he nails his specific brand of comedy in another language, his special bond with Pattinson and how getting his big break in his 50s means he can stay truer to himself. — Jessi Prois, NBC Asian America editorial director Retinol helps with accelerating skin cell turnover, which is why so many experts recommend incorporating it into your routine.

As companies (and the government) continue to bring their employees back to the office, researchers at the University of Toronto recently published a study that shows remote work is protecting women from gender discrimination. The December 2024 report shows that of the more than 1,000 women surveyed, 31% experienced gender discrimination when working at their physical workplace, compared to 17% of those working remotely. The research is part of a larger group of studies that show how women benefit from remote work. From increased participation in the labor market to flexible childcare options, flexible work arrangements have been seen as a large win for working women. Meanwhile, men continue to “disproportionately” benefit from in-person work, according to HR Dive. Still, the study’s authors warned against extrapolating the results too far––remote work won’t fix workplace discrimination, they warned, but the data shows such instances are decreasing. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter Here’s how to grow in your career if you don’t want to be a manager. If you fear layoffs may be in your company’s future, here’s how to protect your career. Still thinking about The Oscars? Here are the leadership lessons you can learn from Sunday’s biggest moments. Melly Barajas, owner and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico made this year's 50 Over 50 Global list. When Melly Barajas, now known as the “Queen of Tequila” among industry circles, first started hiring for her Leyenda de Mexico Tequila distillery, she was shocked to find only women showed up for the job openings. Today, the company produces 20,000 liters of tequila a day to be sold across her brands. I spoke with Barajas, an honoree of this year’s 50 Over 50 Global list, about what it means to run an all-women team, the rise in female distillers, and how she empowers her employees. This is an excerpt of that conversation, of which you can listen to in full here. The tequila industry has been dominated by men for quite some time. Can you walk me through the choice to hire only women to work in the factory when you first started 25 years ago? It wasn’t conscious. Only women started working with me not because I decided to do so. I mean, in the towns of Mexico, you know that most of the men go to the United States or elsewhere to look for other opportunities. So the town was full of daughters, mothers, grandmothers who wanted to do something. So, the fact that they believed in me, that is to say, gave me the driving force that now drives me. They came in and were like “Oh, ma’am I learned how to distill and my son congratulated me and they had never said anything to me!” So they were really excited about contributing. And I had to teach them to have strength and to believe in themselves, too, because it was also very difficult. I would arrive and ask them: “What do you want to do?” “No, well I know how to sweep and mop.” “But what else would you like to learn about? What about this machine?” And they wouldn’t believe they could do it, so a lot of it was also teaching them that they can do it and learn more skills. How have you seen the industry change since you started? I really think this industry needed the female touch. They’ll kill me for having said that, but it’s the truth. I mean, there are really a lot of people, as I said, who have all their lives and pedigree and everything, but women really get to do things a little bit differently. When they tell me that so-and-so died, and the wife, instead of selling the tequila plant she is going to take charge, I applaud them! Or that so-and-so is going to leave his daughter at the front of the tequila factory, I applaud them, to tell you the truth. It is very nice because, whether you like it or not, we give real added value. Women do not subtract. And in this industry the feminine touch was missing. I used to feel horrible arriving at industry meetings and it was all men, and I was standing around like a kid. And now it is so nice to see two, three, four, five women in the room. The pandemic was a really big turning point for lots of businesses and workers alike. Can you talk about how you and Leyenda de Mexico were impacted? We did not close our doors a single day. I’d hear about other distilleries closing and that was like a stake through my heart, you know? I wondered how I was still going, if I should go on. But I kept motivating our workers. I told them: No ladies, we keep going, you can do it. And then sometimes there was a time when I said well, we are going to close even if it is only for 15 days, but when they came and told me, “Ma’am, do you remember my dad would get angry because I came to work? Yes, now he sits down to talk to me at night because I’m financially maintaining our household.” You think I was going to close after that? No. Wow, it’s really about motivating them, right? How have you seen your employees take that motivation and put it into action? Yes. Like I told you before, it’s about teaching them to try different things. After the pandemic, we ramped up production by five times, all with the same amount of staff. The girls would tell me: “Listen, ma’am, I can do this in X-amount of time. But if you buy this new machine I’ll be able to do twice as much.” And that’s how we grew quickly. News from the world of work A top Pentagon DOGE staffer looks like a successful founder, having raised $10 million for a telehealth startup. But Justin Fulcher’s story doesn’t always add up: The company went bankrupt, and he is now being accused of unpaid bills and overstating his credentials, David Jeans reports. Some economists worry that job growth is increasingly limited to a few industries. The unemployment rate remains low, but new jobs are mostly coming from the healthcare and hospitality fields, while the white collar market remains stagnant. Meta must face a lawsuit alleging it prefers to hire international visa-holders over American workers because of cheaper labor, a federal judge ruled last week. The tech giant isn’t the only company currently in litigation over alleged “systemic preferences” for visa holders: Current and former employees of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC are suing the company over alleged “anti-American” discrimination. Workers at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Education are being offered thousands of dollars to quit, up to $50,000 and $25,000, respectively. Corporate America has been known to use pay-to-quit programs as a way to reduce headcount. When Amazon bought Zappos in 2014, for instance, Jeff Bezos implemented a similar program. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Agency announced a “hiring supercharge” for more air traffic controllers after a start of the year filled with high-profile plane accidents. But with long training times, don’t expect the controller shortage to be resolved soon. AI data centers were supposed to be job creator havens, as the companies behind them and politicians touted a boom in employment. But the hiring spree is limited to building the data centers themselves, after which only a few hundred are required to run the large facilities, the Wall Street Journal reports. “Life Is a Game And You Can Change The Costume You Wear At Any Time” What workplace messaging app was down last Wednesday, with some users experiencing difficulties from morning into the early evening?

Title: LA Times Will Label Opinion Articles With AI-Powered ‘Bias Meter’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/la-times-will-label-opinion-articles-with-ai-powered-bias-meter-2000571423

The Los Angeles Times has seen better days as the company’s billionaire owner continues taking a wrecking ball to the nearly 150-year-old institution. Waves of layoffs and editorial interference by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a vocal Trump supporter, has tanked morale, and now the owner has set his sights on AI as the panacea that will improve trust and, ultimately, the fortunes of the newspaper. Soon-Shiong announced this week that opinion articles will now include an AI-powered bias meter that labels articles based on an algorithm’s perceived interpretation of its political leanings. The new labels include âLeft, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right,â and are determined by a startup called Particle.News, which was founded by former Twitter engineers. There will also be a section called “Viewspoints,” powered by AI startup Perplexity, that will display alternative views to those put forth in an article. These new AI products will apply not just to opinion pieces but any âarticles that offer a point of view on an issue,â according to a statement received by The Guardian. Opinion-oriented articles will be more clearly delineated from straight news reports with a new “Voices” label. Standard news articles will not include the AI features. Voices and Insights button now live â¦@latimesâ©. Try it. Now the voice and perspective from all sides can be heard, seen and read âno more echo chamber. Thanks to our talented content management software team running this Graphene platform pic.twitter.com/HslD5dKinz — Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) March 3, 2025 Trust in media is notoriously low, and it is worth experimenting to see how the tide can be turned. But it is all a bit ironic that Soon-Shiong claims to be trying to improve trust in the media while he repeatedly interferes in reporting. The billionaire caught flak in 2024 after sharing on X an opinion piece that the original author claimed was altered after submission to make it appear more positive about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Multiple staffers left after Soon-Shiong similarly interfered in an article regarding one of his friends who got into an altercation over a dog attack. It does not instill much “trust” when the billionaire owner is second-guessing journalists’ decisions about newsworthiness and getting personally involved when reporters are investigating his friends. While the Times’ editorial union is not necessarily opposed to displaying alternative opinions against an article, they say that AI is not the way to do this. The AI-generated viewpoints will not be scrutinized by editors, and of course, AI models continue to make up information and get basic queries wrong (during the recent Oscars, ChatGPT surfaced nominees from the wrong year). Already, the Guardian reports that some of the contrasting viewpoints suggested by the AI tool were featured in the article itself. âThe money for this endeavor could have been directed elsewhere: supporting our journalists on the ground who have had no cost-of-living increase since 2021,â said Matt Hamilton, vice president of the LATimes Guild. It seems inevitable that we are heading towards a place where the internet is rife with AI-created, pseudo-academic writing filled with made-up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into âknowledgeâ as those articles become the training fodder for future models. How much of this will end up in the alternative viewpoints on Times articles?Â Perplexity, it should be noted, has shown disdain for the journalism industry in general by scraping articles and regurgitating them almost whole-cloth in its chatbot, claiming fair use over the practice. When New York Times staffers went on strike last year during labor negotiations, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to provide AI tools that he suggested could replace them. Showing similar disdain for his own employees, it would not be surprising to see Soon-Shiong expand the use of AI to write entire articles. Other news organizations have experimented with AI in small and subtle ways. The Washington Post now automatically summarizes articles and surfaces key points at the top. That newspaper is experiencing its own turmoil as billionaire owner Jeff Bezos pivots from a hands-off ownership to exerting more control and making its opinion section entirely pro-capitalism and “free markets.” The Post lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers since Bezos blocked the newspaper from endorsing Kamala Harris and has again bled subscribers following the changes to the opinion section. It was only a few years ago that the likes of Bezos appeared to be benevolent billionaires who would swoop in and save legacy media from the destruction wrought by the internet. We were naive to believe that. This was always going to be the problem with news organizations owned by billionaires with conflicting interests. Today, the name of the game is pleasing President Trump so he does not go on the attack against Amazon, and perhaps tosses Blue Origin some new contracts.

Title: How Trump’s Tariffs Are Ushering In A New World Order

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff andCFO , Forbes Staff. Today is the day: The sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that President Donald Trump has been talking about since his term began are here. Whether or not they would actually start today was an open question until late Monday afternoon when Trump confirmed them, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, upping new tariffs on the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner to 20%. The announcement sent many key economic indicators way down. Stocks fell across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P cratering. Chip maker Nvidia took an unusually deep tumble, with its stock falling more than 8.6%—though that can be partially attributed to how Chinese buyers are getting around export controls to get Nvidia’s powerful AI chips, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The across-the-board selloff continued Tuesday morning, with all indexes dropping more than 1.4% in the first hour of trading. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a constantly updated forecast of GDP growth based on real-time economic conditions, plummeted from more than 2% to -2.8% based on the tariff announcement. Analysts say that Trump is watching the stock market closely and may use it as an indicator to temper his policies. Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin write that the markets may be the only true check on Trump’s policies—the Republican majority Congress has so far bowed to his wishes with few questions, and many judicial rulings against Trump’s agenda have been appealed and largely unheeded so far. In his first term, Klebnikov and Schifrin write, Trump paid attention to the markets, signing a 2018 trade agreement with China after a tariff announcement caused the markets to fall 5% in one week. But Trump’s reaction may not be the same this week. After all, he’s been talking about tariffs since the campaign trail, calling himself the “Tariff Man” and proclaiming tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” A post on Truth Social yesterday tells farmers that they should get ready to export less because of the coming levies—“Have fun!” China immediately announced retaliatory tariffs and blacklisted some U.S. companies, while Canada introduced a slate of its own charges on the U.S. Target CEO Brian Cornell warned consumers will likely see higher prices this week, since the bulk of fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico this time of year. But Trump is sure to trumpet tariffs and his economic plan at his address to Congress tonight. The reception—both from Congress and Americans watching—will be telling. And this is just one set: New tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and reciprocal tariffs on all countries are slated to go into effect next month. Even if it all goes away or is reduced, Trump's aggressive policy swings may not bode well for the economy as a whole. Forbes senior contributor Christian Weller wrote about the most recent Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, compiled by researchers from Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago. Policy uncertainty leads to a slowing economy, with lower consumer sentiment and industrial production. In other words, certainty is a vital ingredient for economic growth. Since Trump’s election, the uncertainty index has increased by more than 66%. The way businesses operate is likely seeing a permanent change from Trump’s tariffs. Last week, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what it means to business leaders. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. And a reminder that we’re seeking feedback from leaders to help compile Forbes’ next installment of the New Ivies—the public and private colleges that are graduating the most prepared and competitive young talent. Please share your experience in this survey. getty The saga of the Corporate Transparency Act continues. This week, the Treasury Department announced that only foreign companies need to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. President Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, saying the CTA reporting was an “outrageous and invasive” requirement. It’s not surprising Trump doesn’t like the law—he vetoed the bill that contained it in 2021. A bipartisan coalition in Congress overrode his veto. The law sought to shed some light on anonymous shell companies, and as written, required companies to disclose who controls it to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Since it became law, the CTA’s beneficial ownership information reporting requirement has been challenged in federal court cases, putting the requirement on hold, then allowing it to go forward. Before this announcement, the requirement was back, and FinCEN extended the reporting deadline to March 21. It’s unclear what will happen with the still-pending cases. Also unclear: Whether the Republican-majority Congress will object to the president unilaterally halting a bipartisan initiative. President Donald Trump. Since the campaign trail, Trump has said he will create a national cryptocurrency reserve. He announced it on Truth Social over the weekend, saying that the new “crypto strategic reserve” will have bitcoin and ethereum at its core, but will also include XRP, solana and ADA. The announcement builds on a January 23 executive order to create a working group to propose regulations for cryptocurrency and evaluate a “national digital asset stockpile.” However, many big names in crypto and tech didn’t like Trump’s weekend announcement. Forbes’ Derek Saul writes that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that the best option would be using only bitcoin to become the “successor to gold” for the government. Trump supporter and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale said it’s “wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes” and “not the proper, principled role of government” to finance a crypto reserve. And Jason Calacanis, who co-hosts the “All-In” Silicon Valley podcast with Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks, called the move the “Trump Pump” and called it “an insane grift.” A table at a job fair in Florida last year. While it hasn’t shown up yet in economic reports, major U.S. job losses are coming. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that retail closures at national chains Party City and Joann’s will bring 16,000 and 19,000 fewer jobs, respectively. Estée Lauder, Starbucks, Kohl’s and Walmart have also announced major layoffs. And outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported retail job cuts in January were 20% higher than a year ago. Massive job cuts are on the way in other sectors as well. Through Elon Musk’s federal spending slashing as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, tens of thousands of federal government employees have lost their jobs. The job slashing continues, with agencies reportedly offering employees up to $50,000 to voluntarily resign. Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Trump’s tariffs are going from largely a threat to reality today, causing major changes for many businesses worldwide. Before most of them took effect, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what businesses should be doing. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How have tariff threats impacted businesses so far? Johnson: Tariffs increase prices. Prices will go up. If I’m a business leader, the odds are greater than zero that the tariffs will be put in place. When they do, I know that that product for me is going to go up in price. So if I am a prudent leader, I am out looking for alternative sources. The administration wants us to believe that’s a positive, so [businesses] will start shopping in the U.S. But a thoughtful leader's already been canvasing the planet for the lowest cost of that product. There’s lots of reasons you buy things, and most businesses are to some degree always on the lookout for a cheaper, better way to do things. That’s standard business practice. Now, all of a sudden, there’s a new administration and we’re talking tariffs. Everybody is starting to look for alternatives. If those exist in the U.S., that company supplier may benefit from that. But you have to ask yourself, well, why wasn’t the customer in this case already buying American? There’s so much uncertainty. I know that anything I import or anything I buy from somebody who imported it, the price is going up. That’s facts. Now I’m scrambling [to] see what our alternatives are. If it’s a U.S. solution, I suspect that that solution is already more expensive than the import. If the import goes up by a lot, then all of a sudden I may have no choice but to buy American. I don’t mean that as a negative, but I have no choice but to buy a more expensive product made in America. Business people are not paid to be patriotic. They’re paid to be efficient. Businesses likely have been looking at their supply chains and potential impacts for months because of what Trump has said about tariffs. Should they consider these changes as fixes for now, or is this the beginning of a new world order? Absolutely we have a new world order. Anybody who’s looking at the model—the 70 years post World War II—that’s gone. Dead. And I don’t know that we [will] ever recover it. There’s no question that the old rules have changed. Covid started it, and this is now accelerating it. What should companies do? At the board level, it should be a holistic review of the business. What is our value add? If your value add is that you were nothing more than an importer, that business has changed dramatically. If your business is delivering value in other ways, it’s time to reevaluate. It’s a great wake up call. It’s frustrating, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but in a sense it could be incredibly healthy. The smart ones are going to say, ‘Hold on a second, why are we in business? What is it we’re delivering to our customers? What is that value? What do they value? What's the relationship like?’ It doesn’t have to be an eight-month study. Let’s have this discussion: Where are we crossing borders one way or the other? Exporting or importing? Where are we affected on the demand side? Are we shipping outside the U.S.? Are we importing raw material? Are we importing finished goods or equipment? How important is that to our value add? Should we even be in that part of the business? Can we even replace that? Is there a domestic solution that would get you out of that? What advice would you give business leaders looking forward to the next six months? Freeze for a second. Reevaluate some other best practices. Check in with your customers and find out how they’re doing because they may be struggling a bit, and that’s going to come back to you. I would definitely look at my supply chain, where I’m vulnerable both financially and [with] availability, because not having a product is always frustrating to your customers. I would be a bit more cautious on any project that’s got a lot of uncertainty inherent in it. It might just slow down a little bit. I want to protect my balance sheet. I want to protect my current employees. I hate to say this, but you might not hire that extra employee yet. Say to your employees, ‘We’re just being a bit more cautious. I know everyone’s stressed. We appreciate it. This is temporary. We’re not trying to kill you.’ It is time to laser focus in this period of uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty will turn into risk. Some of it will turn into opportunity. The weirdest part is that you may actually become a better business.

DOGE, run by Elon Musk, has been primarily responsible for carrying out this task. Now, for the first time, the FTC has laid off workers from sections such as consumer protection and antitrust. As reported by The Verge, “at least” a dozen probationary staffers at the Federal Trade Commission were laid off last week. The layoffs affected both the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of Competition offices. Until now, the FTC had remained safe from government staff cuts. However, it seems that the measures have finally reached the organization. That said, the report mentions that they could not confirm that the layoffs are directly related to DOGE. Donald Trump authorized the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency after receiving Musk’s idea. Both believed that government organizations have way more employees than they actually need. So, DOGE is in charge of trying to solve that situation. Trump was convinced by the downsizing work Musk did at X (FKA Twitter). There have been recent layoffs at the FTC before, but these were not caused by DOGE either. The department affected at that time was the internal equal opportunity office. This was a result of the executive order signed by Donald Trump banning DEI programs in government organizations. Big tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have also followed this mandate. “DEI is over at the FTC,” said Republican Andrew Ferguson, FTC Chair, at the time. The National Treasury Employees are aware of the layoffs at the FTC. However, they do not know the real scope of the changes underway within the agency. Its website now includes a notice with the steps that the laid-off employees could take now. The Trump administration is also preparing a staff move at the FTC in Washington. They will now occupy the building formerly occupied by the dismantled USAID, Bloomberg reports. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: They warn about Netflix email scam; It looks real but it’s AI
URL: https://www.merca20.com/they-warn-about-netflix-email-scam-it-looks-real-but-its-ai/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T23:58:22Z
Full Content:
Users of Netflix have been warned to be alert to a “sinister” email scam powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that looks almost indistinguishable from the real one. This highlights how scams on social media and the internet have reached alarming levels in recent years, and one of the most effective methods for criminals is the misuse of well-known brand names. Recognized companies such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Adidas, and BBVA have become bait to lure unsuspecting consumers, who often fall for fake offers, nonexistent contests, or fraudulent banking alerts. A report from the Mexican Cybersecurity Association revealed that, during 2024, reports of digital fraud grew by 38 percent compared to the previous year. Of these, 60 percent involved the unauthorized use of recognized brands. According to the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services (Condusef), digital fraud resulted in losses of more than 12 billion pesos in 2024 alone in Mexico. Scams involving the names of major global brands continue to emerge on the internet. Now, one involving Netflix is being reported, which seems “real” because it uses Artificial Intelligence. “Your account is on hold,” the notice says. “Update your payment details. We are having some issues with your current billing information. We will try again, but in the meantime, you may want to update your payment details,” reads the message. It also includes a red button that looks official and says “Update account now.” According to many people, this correspondence is almost identical to a legitimate Netflix message, from the branding to the colors and even the links to the official help page of the platform. When the user clicks on the red button, they are redirected to a convincing Netflix login page, where they will be asked for their username, password, personal address, and Netflix card details. If entered, the user has basically provided the cybercriminals with everything they need to steal their money. While these malicious messaging campaigns have existed since the early days of email, “AI technology has now allowed criminal gangs to generate phishing campaigns at great speed and to more email addresses than ever before,” warned Jake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor for cybersecurity firm ESET. He also added that “cybercriminals have been exploiting AI to target large amounts of email addresses and can easily create login pages that look authentic to trick users into revealing personal information or account credentials.” “However, like traditional phishing attacks, these scams often try to create a sense of urgency, prompting recipients to act quickly without verifying the true origin of the sender or even thinking at all,” he said. Fortunately, there are some telltale signs that an email is a digital wolf in sheep’s clothing. In this case, the email originated from an iCloud email domain, while official Netflix emails always come from an address ending in netflix.com. Netflix also clarified on its site that it will never request bank account details, credit card numbers, or passwords via text message or email. The best way to verify the authenticity of an email is by logging into your official account. With this, we see how these scams continue to grow, prompting major brands to take steps to combat this issue. Companies like BBVA and Amazon have strengthened their awareness campaigns, warning their customers about the risks of interacting with unknown links and unverified profiles. Additionally, platforms like Meta have implemented stricter verification mechanisms for business accounts. The rise of scams on social media and the internet using major brand names serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and critical thinking when browsing online. While businesses and authorities strengthen their protection strategies, individual prevention remains the best defense against these frauds. When does Red Lobster’s Lobsterfest end?

Title: Kara Swisher Wants to Save the Washington Post From Jeff Bezos
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/on-with-kara-swisher-kara-wants-to-save-the-washington-post.html
Time Published: 2025-03-03T20:28:26Z

It’s no secret that Kara Swisher has been trying to figure out how to take the Washington Post off Jeff Bezos’s hands, even though it’s not for sale and the billionaire seems unlikely to part with it any time soon. In the latest episode of On With Kara Swisher, she details why she’s on this “quixotic mission”; laments the Post’s recent struggles, including Bezos’s latest editorial meddling; and shares some conversations she’s had with trusted advisers about her plan, the Post’s legacy and troubles, and why the paper should and must be saved. Below is her opening pitch. Journalist Kara Swisher brings the news and newsmakers to you twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. Kara Swisher: I’m not peacocking … I’m not trying to shame Jeff, either. It’s neither a troll, nor a tale of business derring-do, though I certainly have the ability to raise the money needed. And I have a plan I think would help get the Post back on its feet. But here’s the simple truth: This is a love story. So let me begin by telling you it, and I’ll keep it brief. I got my job at the Washington Post by calling the Metro editor and yelling about a story I had seen in the paper. I was covering the story from my college newspaper, which was at Georgetown University, and the Post did a terrible job of it. And I was angry because I loved the Washington Post, and I was disappointed that they did such a bad job. I got the Metro editor on the phone on my first try, and he invited me down to the Washington Post, which at the time was on 15th Street. So I jumped on the M2 bus and rode it down to the Post. And I walked into the Post newsroom for the very first time, and it was love at first sight. I told the editor my problems that I had with what they had done and how angry I was. And he told me I was obnoxious. Well, I was, but he had let me down, and I said I could do a better job. Right then and there, he hired me as stringer for the Washington Post. And I wrote innumerable stories about the college I was going to. So many, that it got me into the graduate school of journalism at Columbia. I got my first job in journalism by being irritating, so why should I stop now? Back to my career there, I later went on to work in the mail room, as night copy aide, as a news aide, an intern for “Style Plus,” a fill-in for the business section, which morphed into a reporting job including covering retail workplace issues, and ultimately being the first reporter to cover the nascent digital-services business in D.C. in the form of a small company in Vienna, Virginia, called AOL, America Online. It was there I met many people who are now the richest and most powerful in the world. For the most part, they were scrappy entrepreneurs with only a germ of an idea, a difficult road, but lots of aggressive drive. That included Jeff Bezos, who I met in Seattle when I went to check out his start-up called Amazon in the 1990s. As I described him in my memoir, Burn Book, up in Seattle, a short and energetic man was lousy at hiding his wanting ambitions, masking them behind a genuinely infectious, maniacal laugh, a curiously baby-fat face, and an anodyne presentation of pleated khakis, sensible shoes, and a blue oxford shirt. Still, from the start, I had no doubt that Jeff Bezos would eat my face off if that’s what he needed to do to get ahead. Feral, in fact, was the first word that jumped into my head when I met Bezos in the mid-1990s. He brought me to an industrial area near the airport, and I watched as he skittered around the warehouse like a frenetic mongoose. We talked a lot in those days, largely because he needed me to shine a light on his efforts at a very dicey time for Amazon. First when I was at the Post and then at The Wall Street Journal, where I went in 1997 as its first reporter specifically covering the internet. After a lot of ups and downs, Amazon soared on that mongoose energy. Fast forward to 2013 when he suddenly, and a surprise to me, bought the Post from the Graham family for $250 million. By then, it was struggling to deal with the digital age, and I was hopeful that Jeff’s innovative spirit and piles of money would save the paper. Even before Bezos came on the scene, I had been warning former Post owner Don Graham that print newspapers were done for. Despite worries about the tech takeover of media, I hoped Jeff would fully embrace online journalism while holding true to the journalistic standards and ethics of the legacy paper. So I wrote an open letter to Bezos on my media start-up, AllThingsD, and offered some advice: “Don’t treat the Post like some precious thing that cannot be touched or changed. While you certainly should respect its vaunted traditions and hue to ethical standards, that does not mean it gets to stay as it is. That’s the big danger here, that you start acting like the steward of history rather than using the fantastic Washington Post brand to make some new history.” And for the first decade of owning the company, he was a very good owner, trying all manner of updating tech and supporting the newsroom. It was not the glory days of Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham, but it was a solid effort, even if the paper always seemed to lag behind the New York Times. Mostly, he kept his mitts off, which was the right thing to do. He even quietly endured endless attacks from President Donald Trump in his first administration. Again, it was the right thing to do, and he was public about that commitment. Here’s what he said to Axel Springer’s CEO, Mathias Döpfner, about his role at the Post back in 2018. Jeff Bezos: As the owner of the Post, I know at times the Post is going to write stories that are going to make very powerful people very unhappy. Mathias Döpfner: Are you upset if they’re writing critical stories about Amazon, which they do? Bezos: No, no, I’m not upset at all. When I first bought the Post — Döpfner: Would you ever interfere? Bezos: Never. Döpfner: No? Bezos: Never. I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. It would be one of those things, when I’m 80 years old, I would be so unhappy with myself if I interfered. Why would I? Döpfner: Yeah. Bezos: I want that paper to be independent. He went on to say that telling the newsroom what to do would be like taking controls from the pilots of a plane. But when the Trump circus left town and the inexorable decline of the traditional-media business accelerated, losses mounted, and Jeff started to make one bad move after another. In 2023, after bringing in former Microsoft executive Patty Stonesifer, who was well liked at the Post despite having to preside over layoffs and buyouts, Bezos then shows Will Lewis to take over as the new CEO. Lewis had tried to be a media entrepreneur, emphasis on tried, and had been a former CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and before that, a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp back in the days of the U.K. phone-hacking scandal. And one of the first things he did after taking his job at the Post, after trashing the reporters for not wanting to change, which was entirely untrue and obnoxious, in not the good way, was apparently trying to kill a story about his own alleged involvement in that scandal. And when Lewis ousted then–executive editor Sally Buzbee, the first woman to serve in that role, newsroom morale plummeted. Then last October, Bezos decided the Post would end a decadeslong practice and pulled the newsroom’s planned endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris. That Bezos himself made the decision, not Lewis, is according to the Post’s own reporting. While he certainly was within his rights to do so, the timing was curious and there was fallout. Three hundred thousand Post readers canceled their digital subscriptions in response. No surprise, a growing number of editors and reporters started leaving as newsroom morale plummeted once again. That included my wife, former opinion editor Amanda Katz. And at the dawn of Trump 2.0, there have been other examples of the Post seeming to obey in advance. In January, Pulitzer Prize–winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after she said opinion editor David Shipley rejected her cartoon depicting Bezos and other tech billionaires bending the knee before Trump. Last month, the Post pulled an ad deal that called on Trump to fire Elon Musk. And just in case that wasn’t enough, Bezos and many other tech billionaires paid a million dollars plus to yuck it up onstage with Trump during the inauguration. Jeff looked like a prop and a stooge. Finally, last week, Bezos announced that the Post opinion section would be refocused to only publish pieces that are “in support and defense of personal liberties and free markets,” which in libertarian billionaire nincompoop speak roughly translates to “Personal liberties means doing whatever the fuck I want. Free markets means doing whatever the fuck I want.” Now, I love capitalism too, but what that means in practice is incomprehensible and really just dumb. That move essentially forced the resignation of the opinion editor, David Shipley, who declined, as Bezos noted, not to say “hell yes.” “Hell no” was the right response. That was a far cry from that 2018 interview: Bezos: I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. I don’t know if Bezos is now so comfortable with all this interference that he’s gotten over the ick factor, but the rest of us haven’t. As far as I’m concerned, he has killed the Post’s legacy of justice, fairness, commitment to the First Amendment, accountability, and epic badassery created by Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham. Here’s former Post reporter Martha Sherrill: We were always asking more, and we’re pretending we didn’t know things that we maybe thought we knew. But at the same time, you had to kind of have the balls to put the story together. The problem is that Bezos isn’t just any owner. He’s one of the top tech titans in the world, and his real business interests are in Amazon and Blue Origin and not the Post. Now, the biggest competitor to Blue Origin, Elon Musk, is working directly with Trump running DOGE, and I think Jeff wants some of that sweet, sweet government money. Owning an independent media company that is reporting on a presidency and administration that could make or break him, even if he was not such an embarrassing cheerleader, has become a clear conflict of interest. I don’t want to buy the Washington Post to put it on a nostalgia shelf like some precious tchotchke. Even though the Post reportedly lost $100 million last year and about $77 million a year before, I believe there’s an opportunity here. This post has been updated. It originally said that Jeff Bezos hired former Post editor Marty Baron. Baron started as Executive Editor in January 2013, and Bezos completed his purchase of the company that October. The transcript has also been edited for length and clarity. The rest of the episode is a wide-ranging discussion of the Washington Post’s past, present, and future among Kara and former Post writer Sally Quinn, media legend Tina Brown, reporter and critic Oliver Darcy, former Post national editor Cameron Barr, and others. Listen to it here. This episode of On With Kara Swisher was produced by Nishat Kurwa, Cristian Castro Rossel, Kateri Jochum, Megan Cunnane, Lissa Soep, Megan Burney, and Kaelyn Lynch, with mixing by Fernando Arruda and theme music by Trackademics.

Title: What 5 charts say about the pandemic’s impact, 5 years later

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The industry may be far from the dramatic day-to-day struggles of 2020, but it hasn’t yet escaped the long tail the global health crisis left in its wake. The pandemic may have hit retail five years ago, but its impacts came in wave after relentless wave for months after that. Immediate, dramatic effects — including widespread staff furloughs and the temporary closure of entire store footprints — gave way to longer-term challenges as supply chain chaos swept the industry. Government-funded stimulus payments, handed out to ease consumers’ pain, boosted spending, but left long-tail impacts that are still hurting retailers today. A lot of stimulus money ended up in the retail sector, which meant the industry “really ballooned” during the pandemic, according to Coresight Research’s head of global research, John Mercer. “One point we've made repeatedly is that consumers, we think, still haven't ceded what they've spent,” Mercer said, referring to the increased levels of spending shoppers adopted during that time. “But then, of course, the long-term effects of that stimulus is fueling inflation, which then obviously is challenging for consumers.” The rise of inflation also coincided with the depletion of many shoppers’ pandemic-era savings. The result? Shoppers pulled back on discretionary purchases, particularly in those categories that they overspent on while stuck inside. That’s led to the past two years of declines and stagnation in categories like home, which in turn has fueled bankruptcies, even years after COVID stopped being a regular word on the public’s lips. “We're certainly closer to the end, and there's a couple of data points that you can look to that would support that idea,” Declan Gargan, retail director at S&P Global Ratings, told Retail Dive. One of those is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which measures shopper spend on goods versus services. According to that data, the pandemic-era shift towards physical goods, which has remained elevated for several years, has swung back almost entirely to its pre-pandemic share of shoppers’ wallets. “Exiting 2024, it's pretty close,” Gargan said. Mercer believes there’s still a ways to go before discretionary spending normalizes, especially because services like travel were gaining more and more share annually before the pandemic hit. A recent report from real estate firm JLL also expects service-based tenants will account for more retail leases in the coming years, in what it says is an acceleration of a decade-long shift. That suggests the long-tail trends from COVID might still be with us a while longer. “If that balance swings back to how it was before the pandemic, there's still that potential for a multiyear trend to continue in terms of services gaining at the expense of goods,” Mercer said. Still, many of the strongest impacts from the pandemic are finally starting to show up in the rear-view mirror. Here’s a closer look at some of the long-tail impacts from the global health emergency, and what they say about how the industry has recovered. The threat of e-commerce replacing physical retail circulated for years prior to the moment the pandemic forced the issue. Amazon and the rise of e-commerce made regular appearances in bankruptcy documents, with retailers declaring themselves incapable of adjusting fast enough to the shifts in consumer shopping behavior. Then 2020 happened and retailers had to adapt — or risk losing out on sales of any kind. Improving websites and services like buy online, pick up in store became critical investments across the industry as cautious consumers avoided stores even after the initial pandemic scare was over. Unlike other areas of retail that boomed in 2020, though, e-commerce growth has yet to stagnate. According to Gargan, U.S. retail e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales (excluding automotive) had reached roughly 22% as of Q4 last year. That’s compared to roughly 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at the U.S. Commerce Department’s monthly numbers, e-commerce sales in December 2024 were more than $60 billion higher than they were five years previously, a 66% gain in that time period. “We think really it's going to be the larger retailers that benefit — the ones that have the resources, that have been making investments in capital spending, strengthening their digital capabilities,” Gargan said. “They're going to take that growing share and that's a trend that we expect to continue. But that might have been accelerated in terms of consumers adopting online shopping, because they were essentially forced to in the early days.” The idea that stores will be replaced by e-commerce is still nowhere near the truth, but Mercer noted that there is more of an emphasis on where physical retail can prove its worth. The way Coresight Research views it, stores should provide convenience, collection services (as in the picking up of orders), discount offerings or be a destination for shoppers. “There are places where stores can fill in those gaps around e-commerce and digital if they focus on some of those,” Mercer said. Even so, the growth curve of e-commerce may be tapering off soon. A report from FTI Consulting last year suggested the channel was “maturing” and that it would plateau around 35% in the next decade. That still leaves about 12 percentage points of share for e-commerce to take in the coming years, per FTI’s estimate, and new entrants are also making the space more competitive. “Shein and Temu, collectively worldwide, generated sales of over $100 billion last year,” Mercer said. “Now a minority of that is in the U.S., so that's not all coming from U.S. retailers, but a chunk of it is coming from the U.S. — and those are coming predominantly from legacy retailers.” In fact, Mercer said the impact of these competitive challenges on retailers is an “underrecognized story” in the industry, perhaps sidelined given widespread policy changes and consumer sentiment concerns. All of those macro issues are leading to more pressure on legacy retailers, and heavy predictions for store closings in 2025. Numerically, 2020 was a lighter year for store closures than 2019. And 2025 could be worse than both. Partially, that’s because Coresight Research’s store count numbers are based on permanent closures and openings, which leaves out the rash of temporary store closures that swept the world in 2020. But it’s also because 2020, though bad for many retailers, also led fairly swiftly to an influx of stimulus money for shoppers, which meant more spending — and fewer closures. As a result, both 2021 and 2022 saw significantly lower store closings across the industry, with 2022 marking the lowest number since 2012, Mercer said. “And then it kind of got worse from there,” Mercer said. Store closures in 2023, for example, were the worst since 2020 — until last year surpassed them. “So these things, I think, tend to come in waves.” Openings, on the other hand, have stayed incredibly consistent over the years. That may be because the same types of retailers reliably open stores year after year, including dollar stores, grocery stores and off-price retailers. When it comes to closures, though, pandemic-era stimulus money kicked off a boom in consumer spending, which then contracted due to inflation and other pressures. Now we’re seeing the impacts of that subdued spending in an aggressive store closure prediction for 2025. Coresight Research’s expectation — that 15,000 locations could shutter this year — would equate to a 55% increase over 2020’s count, and would more than double last year’s total. But there’s reason for it. Party City ended 2024 by outlining plans to shutter its entire 700-plus store footprint, Joann’s recent announcement adds another 800-plus locations to the count and Big Lots and Macy’s are also pursuing hundreds of closures this year. “They're already piling up,” Mercer said. In addition to the lingering effects of the pandemic, a weak housing market and the overflow impacts of bankruptcies from last year, there are also increasing competitive pressures from the likes of Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. “In some cases, retailers need to slim down their estates — and I think we see that particularly for legacy sectors like department stores and drugstores,” Mercer said. For others, like those in bankruptcy, it’s often more about reducing their cost base. But the pandemic-era pressures causing bankruptcies in some sectors may finally be easing, which could spell lighter store closure numbers in future years. For the home space, the pandemic was a fairy tale turned horror story when the enormous sales gains fueled by stay-at-home orders largely dissipated, leaving retailers reeling from the sudden (and sustained) dropoff in revenue. That category wasn’t the only one hit by shopping behavior changes — electronics and outdoors purchases also boomed in the early days of the pandemic before facing a pullback as consumers moved on from their COVID-era needs. “The pandemic — it's still impacting how consumers shop, where they're shopping and what categories they're shopping for,” Gargan said. “If you think about it, today, the areas in retail that are the most pressured tend to be kind of the specialty retailers — the ones that are focusing on more discretionary-type merchandise — and particularly those that are largely focused on home-related categories.” S&P Global Ratings isn’t expecting a significant uplift in spending across retail this year, but the categories that have been hit the hardest may finally be reaching “trough levels,” Gargan noted. Wayfair leadership said as much in the retailer’s latest earnings call, with CEO Niraj Shah commenting that the e-commerce company believes it’s reached “the bottom of this downcycle” in the home market. Best Buy announced falling electronics sales would reach the end of that cycle in 2023 — and indeed, monthly sales in the sector in 2024 were largely flat or up compared to the year prior — but not at Best Buy, which continued to see sales declines. And crafts and outdoor retailers, which are counted under the same category by the Commerce Department, continue to struggle through lackluster sales trends as well. Those pressures have led to two Joann bankruptcies in roughly a year, layoffs at the likes of REI and Patagonia, and even pullback from Dick’s Sporting Goods on its outdoors ambitions. “To really see an inflection or catalyst that would support sales growth, there's got to be some macro factors that change — and that's principally lower interest rates, bringing mortgage rates down, starting to see improving housing turnover,” Gargan said of the home space. Spaces like electronics could also start to benefit from the product renewal cycle, according to Mercer, as shoppers look to replace the laptops or TVs they bought five years ago. “We've possibly reached, or gone past, the kind of dip in stuff — ‘Oh, well, I bought it during the pandemic. I don't need it anymore,’” Mercer said. “Because five years on, things change. Things wear out. You move house — whatever.” Until sales trends fully recover from the peaks and valleys brought on by COVID, distressed retailers will still be citing the pandemic as a major driver in bankruptcy filings — and according to Gargan, many of them have reason to. “It really wasn't a precipitous dropoff, a one-year period,” Gargan said of the pandemic. “It was really kind of these incremental effects.” There was the pull forward in demand, then the supply chain disruptions, then inflation and higher interest rates. “I think those are all — you can kind of tie that back to the pandemic to some degree,” Gargan said. “And so in that regard, I think it is a fair characterization.” 2020 itself was still an enormous year for bankruptcy filings, as many retailers stopped being able to afford rent without any foot traffic to their stores, but the same trends that kept store closures at bay in 2021 and 2022 played out in bankruptcy filings. Now, faced with the reversal of those behaviors, things have ticked up again. Of the five traditional retailers that defaulted in some fashion last year, the “vast majority” cited the pandemic as a contributing cause, Gargan said of S&P Global Ratings’ data. Four of those five defaults were Chapter 11 filings, he added, which suggests lenders are less willing to negotiate with struggling retailers outside of bankruptcy court. S&P Global Ratings marked 34 bankruptcies in the consumer discretionary and retail markets overall last year. Joann is an interesting example. The retailer closed no stores during its first bankruptcy and is now liquidating its entire 800-plus footprint during its second one after a group including the retailer’s lenders won a bankruptcy auction for the company. “The relationship with their vendors, I think, was impaired beyond their expectations,” Gargan said, noting that suppliers started tightening terms prior to Joann’s first bankruptcy. “I think those issues persisted longer than Joann expected. I think they expected them to be resolved once they exited Chapter 11 the first go around.” With pandemic-driven bankruptcies and closures in 2020 also came meaningful job loss — and surges in hiring as stores reopened and shoppers returned. Layoffs in 2020 more than doubled from 2019, while hiring was up 33%. But ever since then, hiring (and, for the most part, layoffs) have been much more muted. In fact, hiring declined for three consecutive years after 2020 — and in 2024, hiring totals were nearly 40% lower than they were in 2019. Layoffs, after hitting a high of about 185,000 in 2020, were extraordinarily low for two years before popping back up to 2019 levels in 2023. Last year, layoffs were down almost 50%, though still significantly higher than retail’s stimulus-fueled years. “Whether your category is performing better than others, issuers are all facing the same elevated inflationary costs on their business — and so they're looking for ways to offset that,” Gargan said, noting that tariffs and freight rates pose uncertainties for retailers this year. Workforce reductions, like store closures, is one of the ways retailers can trim costs. In a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report earlier this year, the outplacement firm noted that retail jobs have “fundamentally changed” and require different skills than they did in the 2010s. In an email to Retail Dive, Senior Vice President Andy Challenger acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on retailers, but hinted that other forces are now at play. “The pandemic seemed to have permanently shifted how retailers staff and operate, but we've entered a new era where economic uncertainty and falling consumer confidence are driving decision-making,” Challenger said.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Jade Bonacolta landed five promotions at LinkedIn in less than seven years. The secret to her success? A 3-step "pre-read" email she sent her manager before each one-on-one meeting. On the agenda today: But first: A trip to San Francisco. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. I spent much of the past week in San Francisco, where I met many of my West Coast-based colleagues for the first time. What a talented team! It was especially exciting to see them in action. On Tuesday night, a bunch of us were out for drinks around the waterfront — but two people were missing. It turned out they were working on a big scoop: Mira Murati, OpenAI's former chief technology officer, was aiming to raise a $1 billion funding round at about a $9 billion valuation for her new startup, Thinking Machines Lab. "A $9 billion valuation is unusually high for a startup less than a year old, but investors have been eager to back AI startups, especially those founded by former OpenAI employees," wrote Ben Bergman and Julia Hornstein, who broke the story. It certainly got the attention of Elon Musk, who replied to an X user who wondered "How the heck is it valued at $9 billion?" That wasn't the only tech scoop we had this past week. Hugh Langley wrote about Google employees tracking the company's layoffs in a Google Doc. Meanwhile, Eugene Kim revealed Amazon is cracking down on job seekers who use AI in the interview process, which you can read more about below. We also spent some time meeting with VCs and founders. Steve Russolillo, our Chief News Editor, and I had breakfast with Sarah Guo, a Goldman Sachs and Greylock alum who started her own AI-focused VC fund, Conviction, a few years ago. Click here for a Q&A on her views on spotting AI opportunities, making it in tech, and more. The pace of change and the capital at stake in tech right now are mindblowing. Our crackerjack staff is committed to chronicling the boom and what it means for people trying to make it during this wild time. As always, please let me know what you think, at eic@businessinsider.com. At JPMorgan, Monday marks the the beginning of the end of hybrid work. It could also be the start of a standoff between some of the bank's tech workers and CEO Jamie Dimon. Following Dimon's harsh words about remote work, BI spoke with a handful of recruiters and JPMorgan employees about what's to come. While 70% of the bank's employees are back in the office five days a week, tech workers are among those still working a few days from home. Some employees told BI they are considering putting out feelers elsewhere. Others — including Nicolas Welch, who sparked Dimon's infamous town hall comments — want to stick around, under certain conditions. Is RTO a dealbreaker? For years, advanced degrees were a safety net people believed they could rely on when the job market got tough. More recently, the opposite is ringing true. The shift to remote work, skills-based hiring, and AI have altered the white-collar landscape. People with advanced degrees now face longer job searches than their less-educated peers. Some highly educated candidates are even hiding their credentials to try and increase their employment chances. Unemployment by degrees. Goldman Sachs' Dallas office has existed for decades, but it's now experiencing a massive growth spurt. What was once a back-office hub for real estate and private wealth is now the bank's second-largest US office, behind New York. Dallas' lower cost of living and open-door culture are just two of the highlights of working there, employees told BI. A suite for every Mavericks game and free entry to the Nasher Sculpture Center don't hurt, either. Wall Street heads west. Also read: When it comes to AI, Amazon is all for it — except during its job interviews. The retail giant is cracking down on job seekers using AI tools in interviews. Candidates could be disqualified from the hiring process if caught doing so, according to recent Amazon guidelines that BI obtained. The trend is sparking a debate across Silicon Valley. Some companies are open to allowing these apps in job interviews because they're already used at work. A double standard. This week's quote: "I saw it come down. I knew immediately this was really bad — this was one of those moments where things change." — A supervisor who witnessed a freelance crew member get injured on the set of MrBeast's "Beast Games" game show. More of this week's top reads: Can America's kids read? It'll be harder to know after Trump's education cuts, researchers say.

Title: Pluralistic: With Great Power Came No Responsibility (26 Feb 2025) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I traveled to Toronto to deliver the annual Ursula Franklin Lecture at the University of Toronto's Innis College: The lecture was called "With Great Power Came No Responsibility: How Enshittification Conquered the 21st Century and How We Can Overthrow It." It's the latest major speech in my series of talks on the subject, which started with last year's McLuhan Lecture in Berlin: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel And continued with a summer Defcon keynote: https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/17/hack-the-planet/#how-about-a-nice-game-of-chess This speech specifically addresses the unique opportunities for disenshittification created by Trump's rapid unscheduled midair disassembly of the international free trade system. The US used trade deals to force nearly every country in the world to adopt the IP laws that make enshittification possible, and maybe even inevitable. As Trump burns these trade deals to the ground, the rest of the world has an unprecedented opportunity to retaliate against American bullying by getting rid of these laws and producing the tools, devices and services that can protect every tech user (including Americans) from being ripped off by US Big Tech companies. I'm so grateful for the chance to give this talk. I was hosted for the day by the Centre for Culture and Technology, which was founded by Marshall McLuhan, and is housed in the coach house he used for his office. The talk itself took place in Innis College, named for Harold Innis, who is definitely the thinking person's Marshall McLuhan. What's more, I was mentored by Innis's daughter, Anne Innis Dagg, a radical, brilliant feminist biologist who pretty much invented the field of giraffology: https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/#annedagg But with all respect due to Anne and her dad, Ursula Franklin is the thinking person's Harold Innis. A brilliant scientist, activist and communicator who dedicated her life to the idea that the most important fact about a technology wasn't what it did, but who it did it for and who it did it to. Getting to work out of McLuhan's office to present a talk in Innis's theater that was named after Franklin? Swoon! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Franklin Here's the text of the talk, lightly edited: I know tonight’s talk is supposed to be about decaying tech platforms, but I want to start by talking about nurses. A January 2025 report from Groundwork Collective documents how increasingly nurses in the USA are hired through gig apps – "Uber for nurses” – so nurses never know from one day to the next whether they're going to work, or how much they'll get paid. There's something high-tech going on here with those nurses' wages. These nursing apps – a cartel of three companies, Shiftkey, Shiftmed and Carerev – can play all kinds of games with labor pricing. Before Shiftkey offers a nurse a shift, it purchases that worker's credit history from a data-broker. Specifically, it pays to find out how much credit-card debt the nurse is carrying, and whether it is overdue. The more desperate the nurse's financial straits are, the lower the wage on offer. Because the more desperate you are, the less it'll take to get get you to come and do the gruntwork of caring for the sick, the elderly, and the dying. Now, there are lots of things going on here, and they're all terrible. What's more, they are emblematic of “enshittification,” the word I coined to describe the decay of online platforms. When I first started writing about this, I focused on the external symptomology of enshittification, a three stage process: First, the platform is good to its end users, while finding a way to lock them in. Like Google, which minimized ads and maximized spending on engineering for search results, even as they bought their way to dominance, bribing every service or product with a search box to make it a Google search box. So no matter what browser you used, what mobile OS you used, what carrier you had, you would always be searching on Google by default. This got so batshit that by the early 2020s, Google was spending enough money to buy a whole-ass Twitter, every year or two, just to make sure that no one ever tried a search engine that wasn't Google. That's stage one: be good to end users, lock in end users. Stage two is when the platform starts to abuse end users to tempt in and enrich business customers. For Google, that’s advertisers and web publishers. An ever-larger fraction of a Google results page is given over to ads, which are marked with ever-subtler, ever smaller, ever grayer labels. Google uses its commercial surveillance data to target ads to us. So that's stage two: things get worse for end users and get better for business customers. But those business customers also get locked into the platform, dependent on those customers. Once businesses are getting as little as 10% of their revenue from Google, leaving Google becomes an existential risk. We talk a lot about Google's "monopoly" power, which is derived from its dominance as a seller. But Google is also a monopsony, a powerful buyer. So now you have Google acting as a monopolist to its users (stage one), and a monoposonist for its business customers (stage two) and here comes stage three: where Google claws back all the value in the platform, save a homeopathic residue calculated to keep end users locked in, and business customers locked to those end users. Google becomes enshittified. In 2019, Google had a turning point. Search had grown as much as it possibly could. More than 90% of us used Google for search, and we searched for everything. Any thought or idle question that crossed our minds, we typed into Google. How could Google grow? There were no more users left to switch to Google. We weren't going to search for more things. What could Google do? Well, thanks to internal memos published during last year's monopoly trial against Google, we know what they did. They made search worse. They reduced the system's accuracy it so you had to search twice or more to get to the answer, thus doubling the number of queries, and doubling the number of ads. Meanwhile, Google entered into a secret, illegal collusive arrangement with Facebook, codenamed Jedi Blue, to rig the ad market, fixing prices so advertisers paid more and publishers got less. And that's how we get to the enshittified Google of today, where every query serves back a blob of AI slop, over five paid results tagged with the word AD in 8-point, 10% grey on white type, which is, in turn, over ten spammy links from SEO shovelware sites filled with more AI slop. And yet, we still keep using Google, because we're locked into it. That's enshittification, from the outside. A company that's good to end users, while locking them in. Then it makes things worse for end users, to make things better for business customers, while locking them in. Then it takes all the value for itself and turns into a giant pile of shit. Enshittification, a tragedy in three acts. I started off focused on the outward signs of enshittification, but I think it's time we start thinking about what's going in inside the companies to make enshittification possible. What is the technical mechanism for enshittification? I call it twiddling. Digital businesses have infinite flexibility, bequeathed to them by the marvellously flexible digital computers they run on. That means that firms can twiddle the knobs that control the fundamental aspects of their business. Every time you interact with a firm, everything is different: prices, costs, search rankings, recommendations. Which takes me back to our nurses. This scam, where you look up the nurse's debt load and titer down the wage you offer based on it in realtime? That's twiddling. It's something you can only do with a computer. The bosses who are doing this aren't more evil than bosses of yore, they just have better tools. Note that these aren't even tech bosses. These are health-care bosses, who happen to have tech. Digitalization – weaving networked computers through a firm or a sector – enables this kind of twiddling that allows firms to shift value around, from end users to business customers, from business customers back to end users, and eventually, inevitably, to themselves. And digitalization is coming to every sector – like nursing. Which means enshittification is coming to every sector – like nursing. The legal scholar Veena Dubal coined a term to describe the twiddling that suppresses the wages of debt-burdened nurses. It's called "Algorithmic Wage Discrimination," and it follows the gig economy. The gig economy is a major locus of enshittification, and it’s the largest tear in the membrane separating the virtual world from the real world. Gig work, where your shitty boss is a shitty app, and you aren't even allowed to call yourself an employee. Uber invented this trick. Drivers who are picky about the jobs the app puts in front of them start to get higher wage offers. But if they yield to temptation and take some of those higher-waged option, then the wage starts to go down again, in random intervals, by small increments, designed to be below the threshold for human perception. Not so much boiling the frog as poaching it, until the Uber driver has gone into debt to buy a new car, and given up the side hustles that let them be picky about the rides they accepted. Then their wage goes down, and down, and down. Twiddling is a crude trick done quickly. Any task that's simple but time consuming is a prime candidate for automation, and this kind of wage-theft would be unbearably tedious, labor-intensive and expensive to perform manually. No 19th century warehouse full of guys with green eyeshades slaving over ledgers could do this. You need digitalization. Twiddling nurses' hourly wages is a perfect example of the role digitization pays in enshittification. Because this kind of thing isn't just bad for nurses – it's bad for patients, too. Do we really think that paying nurses based on how desperate they are, at a rate calculated to increase that desperation, and thus decrease the wage they are likely to work for, is going to result in nurses delivering the best care? Do you want to your catheter inserted by a nurse on food stamps, who drove an Uber until midnight the night before, and skipped breakfast this morning in order to make rent? This is why it’s so foolish to say "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." “If you’re not paying for the product” ascribes a mystical power to advertising-driven services: the power to bypass our critical faculties by surveilling us, and data-mining the resulting dossiers to locate our mental bind-spots, and weaponize them to get us to buy anything an advertiser is selling. In this formulation, we are complicit in our own exploitation. By choosing to use "free" services, we invite our own exploitation by surveillance capitalists who have perfected a mind-control ray powered by the surveillance data we're voluntarily handing over by choosing ad-driven services. The moral is that if we only went back to paying for things, instead of unrealistically demanding that everything be free, we would restore capitalism to its functional, non-surveillant state, and companies would start treating us better, because we'd be the customers, not the products. That's why the surveillance capitalism hypothesis elevates companies like Apple as virtuous alternatives. Because Apple charges us money, rather than attention, it can focus on giving us better service, rather than exploiting us. There's a superficially plausible logic to this. After all, in 2022, Apple updated its iOS operating system, which runs on iPhones and other mobile devices, introducing a tick box that allowed you to opt out of third-party surveillance, most notably Facebook’s. 96% of Apple customers ticked that box. The other 4% were, presumably drunk, or Facebook employees, or Facebook employees who were drunk. Which makes sense, because if I worked for Facebook, I'd be drunk all the time. So on the face of it, it seems like Apple isn't treating its customers like "the product." But simultaneously with this privacy measure, Apple was secretly turning on its own surveillance system for iPhone owners, which would spy on them in exactly the way Facebook had, for exactly the same purpose: to target ads to you based on the places you'd been, the things you'd searched for, the communications you'd had, the links you'd clicked. Apple didn't ask its customers for permission to spy on them. It didn't let opt out of this spying. It didn’t even tell them about it, and when it was caught, Apple lied about it. It goes without saying that the $1000 Apple distraction rectangle in your pocket is something you paid for. The fact that you've paid for it doesn't stop Apple from treating you as the product. Apple treats its business customers – app vendors – like the product, screwing them out of 30 cents on every dollar they bring in, with mandatory payment processing fees that are 1,000% higher than the already extortionate industry norm. Apple treats its end users – people who shell out a grand for a phone – like the product, spying on them to help target ads to them. Apple treats everyone like the product. This is what's going on with our gig-app nurses: the nurses are the product. The patients are the product. The hospitals are the product. In enshittification, "the product" is anyone who can be productized. Fair and dignified treatment is not something you get as a customer loyalty perk, in exchange for parting with your money, rather than your attention. How do you get fair and dignified treatment? Well, I'm gonna get to that, but let's stay with our nurses for a while first. The nurses are the product, and they're being twiddled, because they've been conscripted into the tech industry, via the digitalization of their own industry. It's tempting to blame digitalization for this. But tech companies were not born enshittified. They spent years – decades – making pleasing products. If you're old enough to remember the launch of Google, you'll recall that, at the outset, Google was magic. You could Ask Jeeves questions for a million years, you could load up Altavista with ten trillion boolean search operators meant to screen out low-grade results, and never come up with answers as crisp, as useful, as helpful, as the ones you'd get from a few vaguely descriptive words in a Google search-bar. There's a reason we all switched to Google. Why so many of us bought iPhones. Why we joined our friends on Facebook. All of these services were born digital. They could have enshittified at any time. But they didn't – until they did. And they did it all at once. If you were a nurse, and every patient that staggered into the ER had the same dreadful symptoms, you'd call the public health department and report a suspected outbreak of a new and dangerous epidemic. Ursula Franklin held that technology's outcomes were not preordained. They are the result of deliberate choices. I like that very much, it's a very science fictional way of thinking about technology. Good science fiction isn't merely about what the technology does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. Those social factors are far more important than the mere technical specifications of a gadget. They're the difference between a system that warns you when you're about to drift out of your lane, and a system that tells your insurer that you nearly drifted out of your lane, so they can add $10 to your monthly premium. They’re the difference between a spell checker that lets you know you've made a typo, and bossware that lets your manager use the number of typos you made this quarter so he can deny your bonus. They’re the difference between an app that remembers where you parked your car, and an app that uses the location of your car as a criterion for including you in a reverse warrant for the identities of everyone in the vicinity of an anti-government protest. I believe that enshittification is caused by changes not to technology, but to the policy environment. These are changes to the rules of the game, undertaken in living memory, by named parties, who were warned at the time about the likely outcomes of their actions, who are today very rich and respected, and face no consequences or accountability for their role in ushering in the enshittocene. They venture out into polite society without ever once wondering if someone is sizing them up for a pitchfork. In other words: I think we created a crimogenic environment, a perfect breeding pool for the most pathogenic practices in our society, that have therefore multiplied, dominating decision-making in our firms and states, leading to a vast enshittening of everything. And I think there's good news there, because if enshittification isn't the result of a new kind of evil person, or the great forces of history bearing down on the moment to turn everything to shit, but rather the result of specific policy choices, then we can reverse those policies, make better ones and emerge from the enshittocene, consigning the enshitternet to the scrapheap of history, a mere transitional state between the old, good internet, and a new, good internet. I'm not going to talk about AI today, because oh my god is AI a boring, overhyped subject. But I will use a metaphor about AI, about the limited liability company, which is a kind of immortal, artificial colony organism in which human beings serve as a kind of gut flora. My colleague Charlie Stross calls corporations "slow AI.” So you've got these slow AIs whose guts are teeming with people, and the AI's imperative, the paperclip it wants to maximize, is profit. To maximize profits, you charge as much as you can, you pay your workers and suppliers as little as you can, you spend as little as possible on safety and quality. Every dollar you don't spend on suppliers, workers, quality or safety is a dollar that can go to executives and shareholders. So there's a simple model of the corporation that could maximize its profits by charging infinity dollars, while paying nothing to its workers or suppliers, and ignoring quality and safety. But that corporation wouldn't make any money, for the obvious reasons that none of us would buy what it was selling, and no one would work for it or supply it with goods. These constraints act as disciplining forces that tamp down the AI's impulse to charge infinity and pay nothing. In tech, we have four of these constraints, anti-enshittificatory sources of discipline that make products and services better, pay workers more, and keep executives’ and shareholders' wealth from growing at the expense of customers, suppliers and labor. The first of these constraints is markets. All other things being equal, a business that charges more and delivers less will lose customers to firms that are more generous about sharing value with workers, customers and suppliers. This is the bedrock of capitalist theory, and it's the ideological basis for competition law, what our American cousins call "antitrust law." The first antitrust law was 1890's Sherman Act, whose sponsor, Senator John Sherman, stumped for it from the senate floor, saying: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. Senator Sherman was reflecting the outrage of the anitmonopolist movement of the day, when proprietors of monopolistic firms assumed the role of dictators, with the power to decide who would work, who would starve, what could be sold, and what it cost. Lacking competitors, they were too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care. As Lily Tomlin used to put it in her spoof AT&T ads on SNL: "We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company.” So what happened to the disciplining force of competition? We killed it. Starting 40-some years ago, the Reagaonomic views of the Chicago School economists transformed antitrust. They threw out John Sherman's idea that we need to keep companies competitive to prevent the emergence of "autocrats of trade,"and installed the idea that monopolies are efficient. In other words, if Google has a 90% search market share, which it does, then we must infer that Google is the best search engine ever, and the best search engine possible. The only reason a better search engine hasn't stepped in is that Google is so skilled, so efficient, that there is no conceivable way to improve upon it. We can tell that Google is the best because it has a monopoly, and we can tell that the monopoly is good because Google is the best. So 40 years ago, the US – and its major trading partners – adopted an explicitly pro-monopoly competition policy. Now, you'll be glad to hear that this isn't what happened to Canada. The US Trade Rep didn't come here and force us to neuter our competition laws. But don't get smug! The reason that didn't happen is that it didn't have to. Because Canada had no competition law to speak of, and never has. In its entire history, the Competition Bureau has challenged three mergers, and it has halted precisely zero mergers, which is how we've ended up with a country that is beholden to the most mediocre plutocrats imaginable like the Irvings, the Westons, the Stronachs, the McCains and the Rogerses. The only reason these chinless wonders were able to conquer this country is that the Americans had been crushing their monopolists before they could conquer the US and move on to us. But 40 years ago, the rest of the world adopted the Chicago School's pro-monopoly "consumer welfare standard,” and we got…monopolies. Monopolies in pharma, beer, glass bottles, vitamin C, athletic shoes, microchips, cars, mattresses, eyeglasses, and, of course, professional wrestling. Remember: these are specific policies adopted in living memory, by named individuals, who were warned, and got rich, and never faced consequences. The economists who conceived of these policies are still around today, polishing their fake Nobel prizes, teaching at elite schools, making millions consulting for blue-chip firms. When we confront them with the wreckage their policies created, they protest their innocence, maintaining – with a straight face – that there's no way to affirmatively connect pro-monopoly policies with the rise of monopolies. It's like we used to put down rat poison and we didn't have a rat problem. Then these guys made us stop, and now rats are chewing our faces off, and they're making wide innocent eyes, saying, "How can you be sure that our anti-rat-poison policies are connected to global rat conquest? Maybe this is simply the Time of the Rat! Maybe sunspots caused rats to become more fecund than at any time in history! And if they bought the rat poison factories and shut them all down, well, so what of it? Shutting down rat poison factories after you've decided to stop putting down rat poison is an economically rational, Pareto-optimal decision." Markets don't discipline tech companies because they don't compete with rivals, they buy them. That's a quote, from Mark Zuckerberg: “It is better to buy than to compete.” Which is why Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram for a billion dollars, even though it only had 12 employees and 25m users. As he wrote in a spectacularly ill-advised middle-of-the-night email to his CFO, he had to buy Instagram, because Facebook users were leaving Facebook for Instagram. By buying Instagram, Zuck ensured that anyone who left Facebook – the platform – would still be a prisoner of Facebook – the company. Despite the fact that Zuckerberg put this confession in writing, the Obama administration let him go ahead with the merger, because every government, of every political stripe, for 40 years, adopted the posture that monopolies were efficient. Now, think about our twiddled, immiserated nurses. Hospitals are among the most consolidated sectors in the US. First, we deregulated pharma mergers, and the pharma companies gobbled each other up at the rate of naughts, and they jacked up the price of drugs. So hospitals also merged to monopoly, a defensive maneuver that let a single hospital chain corner the majority of a region or city and say to the pharma companies, "either you make your products cheaper, or you can't sell them to any of our hospitals." Of course, once this mission was accomplished, the hospitals started screwing the insurers, who staged their own incestuous orgy, buying and merging until most Americans have just three or two insurance options. This let the insurers fight back against the hospitals, but left patients and health care workers defenseless against the consolidated power of hospitals, pharma companies, pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, and other health industry cartels, duopolies and monopolies. Which is why nurses end up signing on to work for hospitals that use these ghastly apps. Remember, there's just three of these apps, replacing dozens of staffing agencies that once competed for nurses' labor. Meanwhile, on the patient side, competition has never exercised discipline. No one ever shopped around for a cheaper ambulance or a better ER while they were having a heart attack. The price that people are willing to pay to not die is “everything they have.” So you have this sector that has no business being a commercial enterprise in the first place, losing what little discipline they faced from competition, paving the way for enshittification. But I said there are four forces that discipline companies. The second one of these forces is regulation, discipline imposed by states. It’s a mistake to see market discipline and state discipline as two isolated realms. They are intimately connected. Because competition is a necessary condition for effective regulation. Let me put this in terms that even the most ideological libertarians can understand. Say you think there should be precisely one regulation that governments should enforce: honoring contracts. For the government to serve as referee in that game, it must have the power to compel the players to honor their contracts. Which means that the smallest government you can have is determined by the largest corporation you're willing to permit. So even if you're the kind of Musk-addled libertarian who can no longer open your copy of Atlas Shrugged because the pages are all stuck together, who pines for markets for human kidneys, and demands the right to sell yourself into slavery, you should still want a robust antitrust regime, so that these contracts can be enforced. When a sector cartelizes, when it collapses into oligarchy, when the internet turns into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four," then it captures its regulators. After all, a sector with 100 competing companies is a rabble, at each others' throats. They can't agree on anything, especially how they're going to lobby. While a sector of five companies – or four – or three – or two – or one – is a cartel, a racket, a conspiracy in waiting. A sector that has been boiled down to a mere handful of firms can agree on a common lobbying position. What's more, they are so insulated from "wasteful competition" that they are aslosh in cash that they can mobilize to make their regulatory preferences into regulations. In other words, they can capture their regulators. “Regulatory capture" may sound abstract and complicated, so let me put it in concrete terms. In the UK, the antitrust regulator is called the Competition and Markets Authority, run – until recently – by Marcus Bokkerink. The CMA has been one of the world's most effective investigators and regulators of Big Tech fuckery. Last month, UK PM Keir Starmer fired Bokkerink and replaced him with Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon UK. Hey, Starmer, the henhouse is on the line, they want their fox back. But back to our nurses: there are plenty of examples of regulatory capture lurking in that example, but I'm going to pick the most egregious one, the fact that there are data brokers who will sell you information about the credit card debts of random Americans. This is because the US Congress hasn't passed a new consumer privacy law since 1988, when Ronald Reagan signed a law called the Video Privacy Protection Act that bans video store clerks from telling newspapers which VHS cassettes you took home. The fact that Congress hasn't updated Americans' privacy protections since Die Hard was in theaters isn't a coincidence or an oversight. It is the expensively purchased inaction of a heavily concentrated – and thus wildly profitable – privacy-invasion industry that has monetized the abuse of human rights at unimaginable scale. The coalition in favor of keeping privacy law frozen since the season finale of St Elsewhere keeps growing, because there is an unbounded set of ways to transform the systematic invasion of our human rights into cash. There's a direct line from this phenomenon to nurses whose paychecks go down when they can't pay their credit-card bills. So competition is dead, regulation is dead, and companies aren't disciplined by markets or by states. But there are four forces that discipline firms, contributing to an inhospitable environment for the reproduction of sociopathic. enshittifying monsters. So let's talk about those other two forces. The first is interoperability, the principle of two or more things working together. Like, you can put anyone's shoelaces in your shoes, anyone's gas in your gas tank, and anyone's lightbulbs in your light-socket. In the non-digital world, interop takes a lot of work, you have to agree on the direction, pitch, diameter, voltage, amperage and wattage for that light socket, or someone's gonna get their hand blown off. But in the digital world, interop is built in, because there's only one kind of computer we know how to make, the Turing-complete, universal, von Neumann machine, a computing machine capable of executing every valid program. Which means that for any enshittifying program, there's a counterenshittificatory program waiting to be run. When HP writes a program to ensure that its printers reject third-party ink, someone else can write a program to disable that checking. For gig workers, antienshittificatory apps can do yeoman duty. For example, Indonesian gig drivers formed co-ops, that commission hackers to write modifications for their dispatch apps. For example, the taxi app won't book a driver to pick someone up at a train station, unless they're right outside, but when the big trains pull in that's a nightmare scene of total, lethal chaos. So drivers have an app that lets them spoof their GPS, which lets them park up around the corner, but have the app tell their bosses that they're right out front of the station. When a fare arrives, they can zip around and pick them up, without contributing to the stationside mishegas. In the USA, a company called Para shipped an app to help Doordash drivers get paid more. You see, Doordash drivers make most of their money on tips, and the Doordash driver app hides the tip amount until you accept a job, meaning you don't know whether you're accepting a job that pays $1.50 or $11.50 with tip, until you agree to take it. So Para made an app that extracted the tip amount and showed it to drivers before they clocked on. But Doordash shut it down, because in America, apps like Para are illegal. In 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and section 1201 of the DMCA makes is a felony to "bypass an access control for a copyrighted work," with penalties of $500k and a 5-year prison sentence for a first offense. So just the act of reverse-engineering an app like the Doordash app is a potential felony, which is why companies are so desperately horny to get you to use their apps rather than their websites. The web is open, apps are closed. The majority of web users have installed an ad blocker (which is also a privacy blocker). But no one installs an ad blocker for an app, because it's a felony to distribute that tool, because you have to reverse-engineer the app to make it. An app is just a website wrapped in enough IP so that the company that made it can send you to prison if you dare to modify it so that it serves your interests rather than theirs. Around the world, we have enacted a thicket of laws, we call “IP laws,” that make it illegal to modify services, products, and devices, so that they serve your interests, rather than the interests of the shareholders. Like I said, these laws were enacted in living memory, by people who are among us, who were warned about the obvious, eminently foreseeable consequences of their reckless plans, who did it anyway. Back in 2010, two ministers from Stephen Harper's government decided to copy-paste America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act into Canadian law. They consulted on the proposal to make it illegal to reverse engineer and modify services, products and devices, and they got an earful! 6,138 Canadians sent in negative comments on the consultation. They warned that making it illegal to bypass digital locks would interfere with repair of devices as diverse as tractors, cars, and medical equipment, from ventilators to insulin pumps. These Canadians warned that laws banning tampering with digital locks would let American tech giants corner digital markets, forcing us to buy our apps and games from American app stores, that could cream off any commission they chose to levy. They warned that these laws were a gift to monopolists who wanted to jack up the price of ink; that these copyright laws, far from serving Canadian artists would lock us to American platforms. Because every time someone in our audience bought a book, a song, a game, a video, that was locked to an American app, it could never be unlocked. So if we, the creative workers of Canada, tried to migrate to a Canadian store, our audience couldn't come with us. They couldn't move their purchases from the US app to a Canadian one. 6,138 Canadians told them this, while just 54 respondents sided with Heritage Minister James Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement. Then, James Moore gave a speech, at the International Chamber of Commerce meeting here in Toronto, where he said he would only be listening to the 54 cranks who supported his terrible ideas, on the grounds that the 6,138 people who disagreed with him were "babyish…radical extremists." So in 2012, we copied America's terrible digital locks law into the Canadian statute book, and now we live in James Moore and Tony Clement's world, where it is illegal to tamper with a digital lock. So if a company puts a digital lock on its product they can do anything behind that lock, and it's a crime to undo it. For example, if HP puts a digital lock on its printers that verifies that you're not using third party ink cartridges, or refilling an HP cartridge, it's a crime to bypass that lock and use third party ink. Which is how HP has gotten away with ratcheting the price of ink up, and up, and up. Printer ink is now the most expensive fluid that a civilian can purchase without a special permit. It's colored water that costs $10k/gallon, which means that you print out your grocery lists with liquid that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby-winning stallion. That's the world we got from Clement and Moore, in living memory, after they were warned, and did it anyway. The world where farmers can't fix their tractors, where independent mechanics can't fix your car, where hospitals during the pandemic lockdowns couldn't service their failing ventilators, where every time a Canadian iPhone user buys an app from a Canadian software author, every dollar they spend takes a round trip through Apple HQ in Cupertino, California and comes back 30 cents lighter. Let me remind you this is the world where a nurse can't get a counter-app, a plug-in, for the “Uber for nurses” app they have to use to get work, that lets them coordinate with other nurses to refuse shifts until the wages on offer rise to a common level or to block surveillance of their movements and activity. Interoperability was a major disciplining force on tech firms. After all, if you make the ads on your website sufficiently obnoxious, some fraction of your users will install an ad-blocker, and you will never earn another penny from them. Because no one in the history of ad-blockers has ever uninstalled an ad-blocker. But once it's illegal to make an ad-blocker, there's no reason not to make the ads as disgusting, invasive, obnoxious as you can, to shift all the value from the end user to shareholders and executives. So we get monopolies and monopolies capture their regulators, and they can ignore the laws they don't like, and prevent laws that might interfere with their predatory conduct – like privacy laws – from being passed. They get new laws passed, laws that let them wield governmental power to prevent other companies from entering the market. So three of the four forces are neutralized: competition, regulation, and interoperability. That left just one disciplining force holding enshittification at bay: labor. Tech workers are a strange sort of workforce, because they have historically been very powerful, able to command high wages and respect, but they did it without joining unions. Union density in tech is abysmal, almost undetectable. Tech workers' power didn't come from solidarity, it came from scarcity. There weren't enough workers to fill the jobs going begging, and tech workers are unfathomnably productive. Even with the sky-high salaries tech workers commanded, every hour of labor they put in generated far more value for their employers. Faced with a tight labor market, and the ability to turn every hour of tech worker overtime into gold, tech bosses pulled out all the stops to motivate that workforce. They appealed to workers' sense of mission, convinced them they were holy warriors, ushering in a new digital age. Google promised them they would "organize the world's information and make it useful.” Facebook promised them they would “make the world more open and connected." There's a name for this tactic: the librarian Fobazi Ettarh calls it "vocational awe." That’s where an appeal to a sense of mission and pride is used to motivate workers to work for longer hours and worse pay. There are all kinds of professions that run on vocational awe: teaching, daycares and eldercare, and, of course, nursing. Techies are different from those other workers though, because they've historically been incredibly scarce, which meant that while bosses could motivate them to work on projects they believed in, for endless hours, the minute bosses ordered them to enshittify the projects they'd missed their mothers' funerals to ship on deadline these workers would tell their bosses to fuck off. If their bosses persisted in these demands, the techies would walk off the job, cross the street, and get a better job the same day. So for many years, tech workers were the fourth and final constraint, holding the line after the constraints of competition, regulation and interop slipped away. But then came the mass tech layoffs. 260,000 in 2023; 150,000 in 2024; tens of thousands this year, with Facebook planning a 5% headcount massacre while doubling its executive bonuses. Tech workers can't tell their bosses to go fuck themselves anymore, because there's ten other workers waiting to take their jobs. Now, I promised I wouldn't talk about AI, but I have to break that promise a little, just to point out that the reason tech bosses are so horny for AI Is because they think it'll let them fire tech workers and replace them with pliant chatbots who'll never tell them to fuck off. So that's where enshittification comes from: multiple changes to the environment. The fourfold collapse of competition, regulation, interoperability and worker power creates an enshittogenic environment, where the greediest, most sociopathic elements in the body corporate thrive at the expense of those elements that act as moderators of their enshittificatory impulses. We can try to cure these corporations. We can use antitrust law to break them up, fine them, force strictures upon them. But until we fix the environment, the contagion will spread to other firms. So let's talk about how we create a hostile environment for enshittifiers, so the population and importance of enshittifying agents in companies dwindles to 1990s levels. We won't get rid of these elements. So long as the profit motive is intact, there will be people whose pursuit of profit is pathological, unmoderated by shame or decency. But we can change the environment so that these don't dominate our lives. Let's talk about antitrust. After 40 years of antitrust decline, this decade has seen a massive, global resurgence of antitrust vigor, one that comes in both left- and right-wing flavors. Over the past four years, the Biden administration’s trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice and Consumer Finance Protection Bureau did more antitrust enforcement than all their predecessors for the past 40 years combined. There's certainly factions of the Trump administration that are hostile to this agenda but Trump's antitrust enforcers at the DoJ and FTC now say that they'll preserve and enforce Biden's new merger guidelines, which stop companies from buying each other up, and they've already filed suit to block a giant tech merger. Of course, last summer a judge found Google guilty of monopolization, and now they're facing a breakup, which explains why they've been so generous and friendly to the Trump administration. Meanwhile, in Canada, our toothless Competition Bureau's got fitted for a set of titanium dentures last June, when Bill C59 passed Parliament, granting sweeping new powers to our antitrust regulator. It's true that UK PM Keir Starmer just fired the head of the UK Competition and Markets Authority and replaced him with the ex-boss of Amazon UK boss.But the thing that makes that so tragic is that the UK CMA had been doing astonishingly great work under various conservative governments. In the EU, they've passed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, and they're going after Big Tech with both barrels. Other countries around the world – Australia, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea and China (yes, China!) – have passed new antitrust laws, and launched major antitrust enforcement actions, often collaborating with each other. So you have the UK Competition and Markets Authority using its investigatory powers to research and publish a deep market study on Apple's abusive 30% app tax, and then the EU uses that report as a roadmap for fining Apple, and then banning Apple's payments monopoly under new regulations.Then South Korea and Japan trustbusters translate the EU's case and win nearly identical cases in their courts What about regulatory capture? Well, we're starting to see regulators get smarter about reining in Big Tech. For example, the EU's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act were designed to bypass the national courts of EU member states, especially Ireland, the tax-haven where US tech companies pretend to have their EU headquarters. The thing about tax havens is that they always turn into crime havens, because if Apple can pretend to be Irish this week, it can pretend to be Maltese or Cypriot or Luxembourgeois next week. So Ireland has to let US Big Tech companies ignore EU privacy laws and other regulations, or it'll lose them to sleazier, more biddable competitor nations. So from now on, EU tech regulation is getting enforced in the EU's federal courts, not in national courts, treating the captured Irish courts as damage and routing around them. Canada needs to strengthen its own tech regulation enforcement, unwinding monopolistic mergers from the likes of Bell and Rogers, but most of all, Canada needs to pursue an interoperability agenda. Last year, Canada passed two very exciting bills: Bill C244, a national Right to Repair law; and Bill C294, an interoperability law. Nominally, both of these laws allow Canadians to fix everything from tractors to insulin pumps, and to modify the software in their devices from games consoles to printers, so they will work with third party app stores, consumables and add-ons. However, these bills are essentially useless, because these bills don’t permit Canadians to acquire tools to break digital locks. So you can modify your printer to accept third party ink, or interpret a car's diagnostic codes so any mechanic can fix it, but only if there isn't a digital lock stopping you from doing so, because giving someone a tool to break a digital lock remains illegal thanks to the law that James Moore and Tony Clement shoved down the nation's throat in 2012. And every single printer, smart speaker, car, tractor, appliance, medical implant and hospital medical device has a digital lock that stops you from fixing it, modifying it, or using third party parts, software, or consumables in it. Which means that these two landmark laws on repair and interop are useless. So why not get rid of the 2012 law that bans breaking digital locks? Because these laws are part of our trade agreement with the USA. This is a law needed to maintain tariff-free access to US markets. I don’t know if you've heard, but Donald Trump is going to impose a 25%, across-the-board tariff against Canadian exports. Trudeau's response is to impose retaliatory tariffs, which will make every American product that Canadians buy 25% more expensive. This is a very weird way to punish America! You know what would be better? Abolish the Canadian laws that protect US Big Tech companies from Canadian competition. Make it legal to reverse-engineer, jailbreak and modify American technology products and services. Don't ask Facebook to pay a link tax to Canadian newspapers, make it legal to jailbreak all of Meta's apps and block all the ads in them, so Mark Zuckerberg doesn't make a dime off of us. Make it legal for Canadian mechanics to jailbreak your Tesla and unlock every subscription feature, like autopilot and full access to your battery, for one price, forever. So you get more out of your car, and when you sell it, then next owner continues to enjoy those features, meaning they'll pay more for your used car. That's how you hurt Elon Musk: not by being performatively appalled at his Nazi salutes. That doesn't cost him a dime. He loves the attention. No! Strike at the rent-extracting, insanely high-margin aftermarket subscriptions he relies on for his Swastikar business. Kick that guy right in the dongle! Let Canadians stand up a Canadian app store for Apple devices, one that charges 3% to process transactions, not 30%. Then, every Canadian news outlet that sells subscriptions through an app, and every Canadian software author, musician and writer who sells through a mobile platform gets a 25% increase in revenues overnight, without signing up a single new customer. But we can sign up new customers, by selling jailbreaking software and access to Canadian app stores, for every mobile device and games console to everyone in the world, and by pitching every games publisher and app maker on selling in the Canadian app store to customers anywhere without paying a 30% vig to American big tech companies. We could sell every mechanic in the world a $100/month subscription to a universal diagnostic tool. Every farmer in the world could buy a kit that would let them fix their own John Deere tractors without paying a $200 callout charge for a Deere technician who inspects the repair the farmer is expected to perform. They'd beat a path to our door. Canada could become a tech export powerhouse, while making everything cheaper for Canadian tech users, while making everything more profitable for anyone who sells media or software in an online store. And – this is the best part – it’s a frontal assault on the largest, most profitable US companies, the companies that are single-handedly keeping the S&P 500 in the black, striking directly at their most profitable lines of business, taking the revenues from those ripoff scams from hundreds of billions to zero, overnight, globally. We don't have to stop at exporting reasonably priced pharmaceuticals to Americans! We could export the extremely lucrative tools of technological liberation to our American friends, too. That's how you win a trade-war. What about workers? Here we have good news and bad news. The good news is that public approval for unions is at a high mark last seen in the early 1970s, and more workers want to join a union than at any time in generations, and unions themselves are sitting on record-breaking cash reserves they could be using to organize those workers. But here's the bad news. The unions spent the Biden years, when they had the most favorable regulatory environment since the Carter administration, when public support for unions was at an all-time high, when more workers than ever wanted to join a union, when they had more money than ever to spend on unionizing those workers, doing fuck all. They allocated mere pittances to union organizing efforts with the result that we finished the Biden years with fewer unionized workers than we started them with. Then we got Trump, who illegally fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the NLRB without a quorum and thus unable to act on unfair labor practices or to certify union elections. This is terrible. But it’s not game over. Trump fired the referees, and he thinks that this means the game has ended. But here's the thing: firing the referee doesn't end the game, it just means we're throwing out the rules. Trump thinks that labor law creates unions, but he's wrong. Unions are why we have labor law. Long before unions were legal, we had unions, who fought goons and ginks and company finks in` pitched battles in the streets. That illegal solidarity resulted in the passage of labor law, which legalized unions. Labor law is passed because workers build power through solidarity. Law doesn't create that solidarity, it merely gives it a formal basis in law. Strip away that formal basis, and the worker power remains. Worker power is the answer to vocational awe. After all, it's good for you and your fellow workers to feel a sense of mission about your jobs. If you feel that sense of mission, if you feel the duty to protect your users, your patients, your patrons, your students, a union lets you fulfill that duty. We saw that in 2023 when Doug Ford promised to destroy the power of Ontario's public workers. Workers across the province rose up, promising a general strike, and Doug Ford folded like one of his cheap suits. Workers kicked the shit out of him, and we'll do it again. Promises made, promises kept. The unscheduled midair disassembly of American labor law means that workers can have each others' backs again. Tech workers need other workers' help, because tech workers aren't scarce anymore, not after a half-million layoffs. Which means tech bosses aren't afraid of them anymore. We know how tech bosses treat workers they aren't afraid of. Look at Jeff Bezos: the workers in his warehouses are injured on the job at 3 times the national rate, his delivery drivers have to pee in bottles, and they are monitored by AI cameras that snitch on them if their eyeballs aren't in the proscribed orientation or if their mouth is open too often while they drive, because policy forbids singing along to the radio. By contrast, Amazon coders get to show up for work with pink mohawks, facial piercings, and black t-shirts that say things their bosses don't understand. They get to pee whenever they want. Jeff Bezos isn't sentimental about tech workers, nor does he harbor a particularized hatred of warehouse workers and delivery drivers. He treats his workers as terribly as he can get away with. That means that the pee bottles are coming for the coders, too. It's not just Amazon, of course. Take Apple. Tim Cook was elevated to CEO in 2011. Apple's board chose him to succeed founder Steve Jobs because he is the guy who figured out how to shift Apple's production to contract manufacturers in China, without skimping on quality assurance, or suffering leaks of product specifications ahead of the company's legendary showy launches. Today, Apple's products are made in a gigantic Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou nicknamed "iPhone City.” Indeed, these devices arrive in shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles in a state of pristine perfection, manufactured to the finest tolerances, and free of any PR leaks. To achieve this miraculous supply chain, all Tim Cook had to do was to make iPhone City a living hell, a place that is so horrific to work that they had to install suicide nets around the worker dorms to catch the plummeting bodies of workers who were so brutalized by Tim Cook's sweatshop that they attempted to take their own lives. Tim Cook is also not sentimentally attached to tech workers, nor is he hostile to Chinese assembly line workers. He just treats his workers as badly as he can get away with, and with mass layoffs in the tech sector he can treat his coders much, much worse How do tech workers get unions? Well, there are tech-specific organizations like Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition. But tech workers will only get unions by having solidarity with other workers and receiving solidarity back from them. We all need to support every union. All workers need to have each other's backs. We are entering a period of omnishambolic polycrisis.The ominous rumble of climate change, authoritarianism, genocide, xenophobia and transphobia has turned into an avalanche. The perpetrators of these crimes against humanity have weaponized the internet, colonizing the 21st century's digital nervous system, using it to attack its host, threatening civilization itself. The enshitternet was purpose-built for this kind of apocalyptic co-option, organized around giant corporations who will trade a habitable planet and human rights for a three percent tax cut, who default us all into twiddle-friendly algorithmic feed, and block the interoperability that would let us escape their clutches with the backing of powerful governments whom they can call upon to "protect their IP rights." It didn't have to be this way. The enshitternet was not inevitable. It was the product of specific policy choices, made in living memory, by named individuals. No one came down off a mountain with two stone tablets, intoning Tony Clement, James Moore: Thou shalt make it a crime for Canadians to jailbreak their phones. Those guys chose enshittification, throwing away thousands of comments from Canadians who warned them what would come of it. We don't have to be eternal prisoners of the catastrophic policy blunders of mediocre Tory ministers. As the omnicrisis polyshambles unfolds around us, we have the means, motive and opportunity to craft Canadian policies that bolster our sovereignty, protect our rights, and help us to set every technology user, in every country (including the USA) free. The Trump presidency is an existential crisis but it also presents opportunities. When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. We once had an old, good internet, whose major defect was that it required too much technical expertise to use, so all our normie friends were excluded from that wondrous playground. Web 2.0's online services had greased slides that made it easy for anyone to get online, but escaping from those Web 2.0 walled gardens meant was like climbing out of a greased pit. A new, good internet is possible, and necessary. We can build it, with all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0. A place where we can find each other, coordinate and mobilize to resist and survive climate collapse, fascism, genocide and authoritarianism. We can build that new, good internet, and we must.

The steps in this guide have generated A$979,000 in salary, measured as the sum of the highest annual salaries friends and readers have reached after following along, where they were willing to attribute their success actions in here. If it works for you, email me so I can bump the number up. I currently run my business out of my own pocket. If I don't make sales, I lose savings, and it's as simple as that. I am all-in on creating work I love by force of arms, and I'd sooner leave the industry than be disrespected at a normal workplace again. The impetus to run that risk comes from two places. The first is that my tolerance for middle managers jerking themselves off at my expense is totally eroded, and I realized that I either had to do something about it or stop complaining. I'll happily go to an office if I think it will produce something I care about, but I will not do it because someone wants to impress a withered husk who thinks his sports car makes him attractive to young women. The second, and what this post is about, is that I am really good at getting jobs, and have friends with a very deep understanding of how the job market works. In Australia, when you apply for a job without permanent residency, you are filtered out of all applications immediately. It is the first question on all online application forms, and the reason is that companies do not want to deal with visa renewals and they have far too many candidates. This leads to a situation where any characteristic that is remotely inconvenient but not noticeably correlated with suitability for the business is grounds for rejection. It is not uncommon for immigrants to take months, sometimes over a year, to find their first job actually writing code. Despite being a non-white with no professional network in the country and an undesirable visa, I had my first paid programming engagement lined up before finalizing the move off my student visa. I had a full-time job on A$117K lined up for the same day my full work visa kicked in. I continued to dig up work whenever a contract was expiring, even landing a gig mid-COVID, and while most of these jobs left much to be desired, I believe this has more to do with the state of the industry in Australia than anything that I did. And I have only gotten better at this over the past two years, because while I despaired about the state of software in general, I never stopped thinking and experimenting about how to regain some control over how I'm treated. Almost everyone I spend time with now has walked away from a job without flinching. I've done it. I once caught up with a friend, and he said "Work is stupid, I'm going to Valencia for a year." I said, "W-what? Valencia? When? For a year?" "Yeah, a year. I'm going in two weeks." And then that glorious son of a bitch did it. Came home. Had a job waiting for him. Quit that job, got another job at more money. Quit that job, got one interstate because he felt like it at similar pay for half the work. All in a "weak" market. I get a lot of emails from people who despair about the state of the industry or who otherwise can't find jobs, and I always end up giving the same advice. I don't have the time to keep doing that. So in this post, I'm going to attempt to convince thousands of people that you should have much higher standards for what you tolerate, that you can build up the reserves to do your version of going to Valencia (this could just be staying home and playing with your kids for six months), and that it is immensely risky not to have this ability in your back pocket. Along the way, we will answer questions like "How long should a CV be?", "What should go on it?", and "When will this suffering end?" From Scott Smitelli's phenomenal The Ideal Candidate Will Be Punched In The Stomach: What was the plan here? Why did you leave a perfectly sustainable—if difficult and slightly unrewarding—job to do this crap? What even is this crap? You are, and let’s not mince words here, you are a thief. That’s the only way to make sense of this situation: You are stealing money from somebody, somehow. This is money you have not earned. There is no legitimate way that you should be receiving any form of compensation for simply absorbing abuse. These people, maybe the whole company but certainly the people in your immediate management chain, are irredeemably damaged to be using human beings that way. They will take, and take, and smile at you like they’re doing you some kind of favor, and maybe throw you a little perk from time to time to distract you from thinking about it too hard. But you? You can’t stop thinking. You can’t stop thinking. 4:44. You can’t stop thinking. If you're in this photo and don't like it, this blog post is for you. We have one end-goal. A career where you're paid well, are treated with real respect, and we will not settle for less. And I mean real respect, as in "we will not proceed on this major project without your professional blessing, and you can fire abusive clients", not "you can work from home two days a week if the boss is feeling generous". I had a brief email exchange with Erez Zukerman, the CEO of ZSA last year, and asked how their customer support is so good — it's the best customer support I've ever experienced and there's no close second. He replied: For support, the basic understanding is that support is the heart of the business. It is not an afterthought. Support is a senior position at ZSA, with judgment, power of review over features and website updates before anything is released (nothing major goes out without a green line from every member of support), the power to fire customers (!), real flexibility when it comes to the schedule, etc. There are also lots of ways to expand, like writing (Robin has been writing incredible blog posts and creating printables), recording (Tisha recorded Tisha Talks Switches which thousands of people enjoyed), and more. Anything short of that isn't real respect. Not a special parking spot. Not the ability to pick up your kids sometimes. Not a patronizing award on Teams. Most places fall short of this, and because we have all agreed to demand better for ourselves, we are going to consider all of these places as mildly abusive. A lot of office jobs seem like a slow death of the soul — better than the swift death of the body that careers like construction work offer, but that isn't a reason to stop striving. Shoddy work. Hour long stand-ups. The deadlines are somehow always urgent and must be delivered immediately, but are also always late and everyone knows they'll be late from day one. This is delightful at times — office scenes in improvised theater get funnier the straighter you play them — but many people eventually feel that something vital is missing from their work lives. I really enjoy David Whyte's The Three Marriages as an antidote to the tedious objection of "Work to live, don't live to work". It's a part of life, and while it isn't all of life, being bored and treated like a disposable cog for eight hours a day shouldn't be any part of your life. If you're happy to coast, adieu, catch you later. This a no judgement zone for the next five minutes. Here is a quick reality check. I have, by virtue of hundreds of people reaching out to me over this blog, seen the "I want to leave my bad job" story play out far more times than a typical person does in a lifetime. It always plays out in one of two ways. The first is that the person immediately and aggressively looks for new jobs. This usually goes well. If it does not go well, they can always find a new job again. When the job is pursued through "normal" mechanisms, such as cold Seek applications, these jobs almost never meet the standard I set above: great pay, great team, great interview process, and whatever office arrangement you prefer. But they've always been doing better along at least some of the four measures. The other story is much more typical, and it goes something like this: I'd love to leave, but there's something keeping me. One more year and I'll get a new title, and then I'll be so well-placed for a new job. I've heard the market is bad, so I should wait until it picks up again. I'll get a raise soon, then I'll negotiate for a new job. I'm scared of keeping up with mortgage repayments. I just need a year to finish up this project, it'll look great on my CV. My network is terrible, so I don't have the same options open to me. I think I can make a difference if I'm given a few more months. In two years, this second approach has never gone well. Never, ever, ever. Consider this real exchange, copied verbatim and redacted. May, 2024: Me: I'm a little bit concerned that the pathway above leads to delaying indefinitely (there's always going to be a risk of moving then getting laid off - so what risk level do you actually tolerate, and how is that balanced against [COMPANY] being run so badly that you can get laid off there too?) but you know your situation better than me. Reader: Well, the company was bought out and seems to be stabilizing. July, 2024: Reader: Got some fantastic news! Gonna get a raise at [COMPANY], 20%! It came as a surprise, apparently they think I earn too little so they're giving me a raise because of that. November, 2024: Reader: Wanted to let you know I got news, I'm gonna be fired next month. This happens so often that it's actually boring for me. I've had exchanges like the above often enough that I know the person is finished months before they do. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. They will either be let go, burn out and quit, or burn out and stay there as their health deteriorates. No one, at any level short of executive, has managed to have the impact that would be required for them to feel it was worth the cost. The thing that is missing, to my eyes, is some sense of confidence and self-respect. I hear lots of supposed barriers to getting a better job, but almost none of them are convincing, especially from people in the first world, so what I'm actually hearing about are psychological barriers. It takes a certain degree of confidence to know that you have worth, because a great deal of our society, whether by coincidence or design, causes people to feel like they're not desirable. If you don't have confidence, you feel trapped at the current situation, because what if you can't find something else? What if you're not good enough? This is a real risk, but guess what, life's risky! Two months ago, one of my high school classmates, one of the fittest people I know, died of an aneurysm at age 29. Think about it this way: enough people read this blog that if you are reading this sentence, you have just drawn a ticket in the "heart attack kills me by December" lottery. This isn't hypothetical, this will happen — someone reading this will die having spent a few hundred hours on spreadsheets this year, and perhaps even have time to think "I wish I had listened to Ludic, he is so smart and wise."1 And on self-respect, I will concede that you're getting the vestiges of my time spent in psychology, but why would anyone respect you if you let someone do Scrum at you for hours? No one respected me when I let people do Scrum at me, and that was my fault. "It what der street trolls make when dey is short o' cash an' ... what is it dey's short of, Brick?" The moving spoon paused. "Dey is short o' self-respec', Sergeant," he said, as one might who'd had the lesson shouted into his ear for twenty minutes. So where do we start off? Well, the first thing to do is bury the idea that you need this particular job, or that you are otherwise unworthy. And we're going to do that by getting really good at getting mediocre jobs, and we're almost always going to want to be doing day-rate contracts. We are going to do a lot of things that I do not endorse when going for a good job, like sending your CV anywhere, talking to recruiters, etc. Regular full-time jobs obtained through mass-market channels have dysfunctional social dynamics that are too complex to get into here. Patrick McKenzie writes: Many people think job searches go something like this: See ad for job on Monster.com Send in a resume. Get an interview. Get asked for salary requirements. Get offered your salary requirement plus 5%. Try to negotiate that offer, if you can bring yourself to. This is an effective strategy for job searching if you enjoy alternating bouts of being unemployed, being poorly compensated, and then treated like a disposable peon. Working jobs like the above comes at a real cost, even if you can get them at-will. I had an episode of intense burnout which resulted in a year of recovery, and I had to think very hard about how to not feel trapped in a bad situation again, even if the business fails. I do not want to attend hour-long stand-ups anymore. This section is about how to get the above jobs as effectively and painlessly as possible, but they will still not be great, and if you do them forever then I will be very disappointed in you. In any case, if one must engage with the market in this way to build confidence and a reputation, then day-rate contracts are amazing. I am heavily in favour of contracting. The day rate is much higher. You are forced to continue searching every few months, which means you are also forced to always be aware that you have options, and we will discuss how to minimize the pain of this. You will meet far more people because you will be at a new workplace every few months. Here in Australia, a weak contracting job will pay A$1K per day, which is approximately double what a permanent employee earns. I.e, for every six months of contracting, you can afford six months of unemployment, and you're still as well off as you were if you had been permanently employed over that period. Contracts are terminated more frequently, but you're also in a much better position because you've saved way more money per day worked, you've met tons more people, and your CV is always up-to-date. And you also knew it was going to expire in six months, so having it end three months early isn't a horrible shock to your planning. You are also excluded from the most mentally draining practices in a corporate environment, and afforded a higher status than regular employees. You will usually not be asked to attend pointless meetings, and instead be left free to execute on technical work, particularly if you indicate that you can manage scope independently. If someone does ask you to attend a pointless meeting, you can recite the Litany of a Thousands Dollars a Day in your head over and over as the project manager attempts to flay your mind. You know that delightful period after you've submitted a resignation and you're about to get out? That's the whole contract. A six month contract feels like handing in a resignation with six months of notice. When the CEO says "Can we put GenAI and blockchain in the product?", you can close your eyes, my God you are so happy, and whisper "Inshallah, I will not be on this train when it derails". None of these jobs will be great. This is not a good way to get jobs in the long-term. This is a boring, soulless way for someone that does not have any appreciable career capital or networking ability to generate adequate jobs on high pay. We only bother with this so that you know that if your business explodes, or the cool non-profit you find fires you, or if a new boss comes in and abuses you, you'll know deep down that you can walk right out that door and tell them to get fucked. I should note that the advice in this section was heavily contributed to by a friend who wishes to remain anonymous, but let us all send them silent thanks. Anyway, we take Sturgeon's Law very seriously on this blog. Ninety percent of everything is crap. It is with this understanding that we must proceed. There is a pathway to navigate that relies entirely on the broad understanding that: Let us begin with recruiters. Recruiters are an unfortunate reality of the industry. I still haven't worked out why they exist when a company can just post a job ad themselves, and their talent team has to filter out the candidates themselves anyway, but whatever. They're here, and I've learned enough about the world to accept that it's 50/50 on whether their existence is economically rational. In 2019, about a month into my first full-time programming job, I received a call from a recruiter. They were looking for someone with Airflow experience to work a contract with Coles, a massive Australian grocery chain. I had no idea what to really say to this, being inexperienced and hugely underconfident, so I just listened to his questions and answered them. Most of my answers were a sad: "Ah, no, sorry, I know what AWS is but I've never used it before at a real business. I know what Airflow is, but I've never..." Until finally we come across the fateful question: "And do you know Linux?" Why, yes, I do know Linux. At that stage of my career, it never even occurred to me to ponder what knowing Linux is. Do I even know my keyboard if I can't construct one from scratch? What does he mean know? How deranged would I have to be to say I know Python, without qualification, without being a core contributor? But none of that occurred to me, I just said yes. He is delighted, we get to chatting, and we quickly realize that we're both working our first jobs! He is a year younger, also nervous about his job, and is so happy to be talking to someone that just sounds like a normal person. He is soon comfortable enough to ask me a very vulnerable question: "So what is Linux?" I answer, and I've been doing nothing but teach psychologists-in-training statistics for a year, so the explanation is good. Each good explanation leads to another, until I'm fielding questions like: "What is Airflow? What is AWS?" We hang up, on good terms, and I stare at the wall for a long moment. There are people out there just like, calling around and functionally asking "Have you used FeebleGlorp for eight years?" with no internal model of what FeebleGlorp might be? That can't be right. Everyone at school told me that affairs would be very serious in the real world. Affairs are not very serious in the real world. Affairs have never been less serious. I told myself for a while that this must have been because he was so young, but no, they're actually almost all like this. I have only ever met two recruiters with intact brains2. To quote a reader with extensive HR experience who attempted to explain this dysfunction to me: While there are professionals that specialize in tech and with time develop enough depth to understand the discipline and move the needle in the right direction, for most recruiters it is not an economic advantage to do so; as the winds of the market are ever changing, recruiters are always the first ones to go into the chopping block when there are layoffs. Better to be a generalist recruiter and keep your job options open. I.e, the recruiters you are talking to probably go out of their way to avoid learning anything, because they may be recruiting in a different industry next month. This means a few things. I normally do not send CVs anywhere and decry them, but I've reversed my stance. They're a terrible way to get good jobs, but a heavily optimized CV will demolish most other candidates, who are about as unserious as the recruiters. So how do we optimize? Well, we're trying to get past recruiters. On your CV, quality indicators only matter if the recruiter can understand them, and as per the above they do not understand anything. At 12:34 PM today, while writing this blog post, I got a call from a recruiter and I asked them a question for blog material. "Hey, question about my CV, would it be better if I mentioned that I'm well-regarded by Linus Torvalds?" (This is not true, we don't know each other.) And they said, "Uh, I'd leave that out, these are very busy people and need technical credentials." Recruiters are only looking for one thing. They are looking for the number of years of experience that you say you have in buzzword, and possibly that you've worked somewhere like Google — but I've never seen a Googler compete for open-market contracts, so don't feel too disadvantaged. Years of experience with buzzword is the only thing that matters. Delete everything else. Link to your GitHub profile? Goodbye, none of these people are going to read that. I've been assured that the typical talent team spends five to ten seconds per CV. I am a passionate front-end developer with a drive for — no one cares, and if you reflect on how you felt even writing that sentence, of course no one cares. You didn't care. My CV used to say things like "deployed a deep learning project in collaboration with Google engineers" and it had sections like this: Some of the most talented people I know in Australia have told me that that this would qualify me for an instant interview on their teams, but this CV does not work because the person reading your CV will not care about the craft. If someone that does care reads it, it will be after four untalented people decided it was allowed to land on their desk, and at that point they're going to interview you anyway so your CV doesn't matter. The ideal CV starts with lines like this: Five (5) years expert skills in cloud database development and integration (Databricks, Snowflake) using ETL/ELT tools (dbt and Airbyte) and deploying cloud computing with AWS (EC2, RDS) and Azure (VM) cloud platforms The rest of the CV should be more lines like that, nothing else matters. A senior talent acquisition nerd at McKenzie told me that CVs should be one page, because it shows that the candidate is concise. Their counterpart at another agency said that you need three pages or you can barely get to know the candidate. Which of them is right? Both of them had no idea what they're talking about, because both of them are just eyeballing it, coming up with post-hoc rationalizations for their behavior that ignores the real hard question of why they specialize in hiring talent in fields that they cannot describe. I now trend towards a three page CV for no reason other than it looks like I must have more experience if it won't fit on one page, and it gives me more space to put buzzwords in. And when I say buzzwords, I mean you need the room to write things like "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" because some of the people reading the CVs do not know they are the same thing. Act on the principle of minimum charity, and accept that this version of your CV will never get you a great job. We know what we're optimizing for at this stage, and it isn't amazing colleagues, it is the ability to refill your coffers very quickly and with minimal pain. Okay, but which buzzwords do you pick? If you hop onto a job search platform, you are going to see many jobs that are essentially asking you to cosplay as a software engineer. For example, I have just hopped onto Seek and punched in "data engineer", my own subspecialty. This immediately yields this job from an international consultancy whose frontpage reads: GenAI is the most powerful force in business—and society—since the steam engine. As software and code generate more value than ever, every worker, business leader, student, and parent is now asking: Are we ready? Wow, that sure is something! I think speak on behalf of all of us when I say "please stop, you're hurting us". Also it looks like there isn't a single mention of AI on their website in 2022, so I'm really impressed that they've become experts in a novel technology just in time to cash in on over-excited executives. But what does the actual job listing entail? Proficient in Azure Data Factory, Databricks, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). And from this, by mental force, I can tell you everything you need to know about the job. My third eye is fully open, and the recruiting department's pathetic attempts to ward off my psychic intrusions are but tattered veils before a hurricane. They are almost certainly recruiting data engineers for a company with a very weak IT department, probably a government client, that is in the middle of a failing cloud migration. SSIS is the phylactery of a millennia old lich-king, a piece of software that runs out of SQL Server on old government data warehouses everywhere. The first time I had to fix an SSIS production outage, the senior engineer on my team told me to "untick all the boxes on that screen, then re-tick them all and click save", and that actually solved the problem. The entire point of a cloud migration is to stop using SSIS and use something better, but that would require you to be good at your job, so instead consultancies sell Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory is notable for having been forged in the hottest furnace in Hell. The last time I used it, I clicked "save" on a slow internet connection and it started to open and close random panels for five minutes before saving my work, which I can only assume means that the product has to open every component on the front-end to fetch data from the DOM to populate a POST request... which is, you know, is certainly one way that we could do things. Why use something so bad? It's because Azure Data Factory can be used to run SSIS packages! So now you're on the cloud, and have a new bad service running your old bad service, all without actually improving anything! And of course, they are both tools that do not require programming, so the consultancy can sell you a team of non-programmers for $2,000 per day. I've worked alongside one of these teams. They had one good developer who desperately tried to handle all of their work at once, and I shit you not, four "engineers" that spent eight hours a day copying-and-pasting secrets out of legacy SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory's secret manager for weeks on end. With a bit of experience, most job listings are simply an honor roll of dead IT projects. And because many executives hop onto the same bandwagons at the same times (but call it innovation), there seem to be specific patterns for the type of cog that companies are pursuing at any given moment. The friend who gave me most of the tips in here has an "Azure Data Engineer" CV, where he removes all mention of AWS work he has done so that government recruiters don't hurt their pretty little heads, and vice versa. Companies on Azure want Databricks because you can spin it up from the Azure UI, and companies on AWS similarly use Snowflake because of groupthink. Just smash those words onto the page. Every field can think of some variation of this. If you're a data scientist, it'll be a few common patterns to try cram LLMs into things. If you're a front-end developer, it's probably going to be a soup of React and its supporting technologies. Again, no one reading your CV until the final stage will know anything. Once, a recruiter had coffee with me, and they asked me why Git is such a popular programming language. I write my CV in Overleaf because I can make faster edits during the early phases of figuring out which patterns work, and fidgeting with layout is probably the most annoying part of any sort of CV-writing. This is a tough situation. What I did was looking up a few "easy" jobs, like data analyst, hop onto LinkedIn, navigate to that company's page, then navigate to someone that looks like they might be leading the relevant team. Do not message HR. They, as a rule, do not have human frailties like mercy and kindness while they are at work. Go straight to someone that actually cares if you are good at the job, and impress upon them that you are a real person, who either has a very cool life story about changing career pathways late in life, or who is an adorable graduate UwU. If you are super, super, super desperate, my company has an unpaid internship for graduates that really, really, really think that they just need a tiny bit of experience to get taken seriously. Once you're done scrubbing all signs of personality or competence out of your CV, leaving only eight (8) years of experience, what then? If you're going to be doing this all the time, how do we make it relatively painless? The first thing is to hop onto a bunch of job platforms and upload the CV. That's simple enough. This means that recruiters will start reaching out to you every week or so, and some of them will have jobs for you. 90% of them will fail to secure you an interview. I start the conversations with something like "In the interest of making sure we're making good use of time, what's the expected compensation for the job?". They'll say a number. If the number isn't high enough, thank them for their time and hang up. Don't waste your time. They will not present you to the candidate if you ask them to do any work beyond sending a CV and collecting a commission — from their perspective, you are cattle to be sold. If I was desperate, I would take the first job offered to me at any pay, then not slow my search down at all. Most contracts allow you to quit on very short notice, so use that against the employer instead of having it used against you for a change. The second thing is that you can start testing out the CV in the lowest-effort manner possible. The recommendation from my friend that has experimented the most is to grab a job platform's app on your phone, and to apply to maybe three or four jobs every morning. Don't bother with ones that ask you to make accounts on new job platforms, or write cover letters, or anything like that. Save a filter that removes anything you aren't willing to do, whether it's pay that's too low or a long commute. Err on the side of being picky, and do this every workday, even if you already have a contract. If the list of jobs becomes empty, then you must either relax your constraints or move to a new area. Sorry! If you get as far as a call with a human and are later rejected, ask them, especially recruiters, what employers want to see. They will tell you which buzzwords are good. If there is any conceivable way that you can claim to have experience in an important buzzword, write it down. This is incidentally how the strain of doing this is best managed — by not doing anything more arduous than reading a few jobs and clicking "apply", then not thinking about it until the next day. Don't apply to so many that it feels like even a bit of an ordeal. Do not let rejection affect you, most of the people involved in this process do not deserve your respect in this instance. I am sure they are lovely husbands and wives and sons and we don't care right now. It has taken up to two months before calls have started rolling in, and that is why I'd suggest doing this more-or-less constantly, even when settled into a contract role. You want to know if jobs have suddenly started to dry up, or if you need to make adjustments to your buzzword soup. A fair number of these jobs won't do any sort of diligence. The interview will be fine. Questions will sometimes be on the level of "Do you know Python?", a real question that a real director asked me before paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I've done a few more unpleasant interviews, detailed here, but at this point they don't bother me. If I found myself in another one of these situations, I would hang up mid-call. Eat your assertiveness vegetables, they'll put hair on your chest. Quit. You got this job, you'll get another job. Don't quit, duh. Listen man, I didn't design the industry, but I rolled brown skin and an Indian name at character creation. I'm just doing what I've gotta do. All those jobs will be mediocre, but you won't feel like any particular person has too much power over you. But still, the second job market is where you actually want to be. This is the promised land where people have functioning test suites, the executives know something about the work being undertaken, your colleagues are not Senior Void Gazers who have been so thoroughly beaten down by the industry that they dully repeat "it's a living and I have kids", and as a bonus you're probably paid about 50% more. It is so totally divorced from the first job market that people in it sometimes do not understand that the first job market exists. Famous Netflix-guy-turned-Twitch-streamer, the Primagen, has never even heard of PowerBI, what is probably the most popular analytics tool on the planet. These people are blessed. It is not accessible via Seek. It is accessible entirely through having well-placed friends and a reputation for being a cool person with a modicum of self-respect. You can't generate these by pulling the "apply for job" lever over and over. This way you don't have to pray that your friend's companies are hiring at any given moment, you'll just always know that you've got an interview every few weeks. Because getting in here isn't very predictable, this section is general advice in no particular order. If the company asks you to do Leetcode stuff, my opinion right now is that they're probably at least a bit serious, but I don't think a place that asks you to grovel before entry is a great place to be along non-technical dimensions. Erik Dietrich calls this type of interview "carnival cash", rewarding compliant employees and middle managers with the opportunity to terrorize their fellow humans instead of with money. I'm not that sure about this point. I'd probably be bad at a Leetcode interview, so I'm biased against them. Maybe they're correlated with high quality programming performance in some way that I don't understand. People often say "I don't have any connections" or "My network is terrible". This was a 0% judgement zone earlier. It is now a 0% sympathy zone. There is a phenomenon I refer to called "trying to try". It can be broadly summarized as any set of behaviors where someone has not seriously engaged their brain, does not really believe that they're doing anything with a serious chance of success, and are more-or-less just looking for reasons to say that they tried but failed. This happens in subtle places — for example, when training with beginner sabre fencers, you can stand perfectly immobile and they will very consistently hit your blade instead of you. They are so panicked and upset that their body is not trying to win, simply going through the motions of what fencing looks like. This manifests in all sorts of ways that I'll talk about one day, but it's so apparent in the job search. "I've applied for fifty jobs and no one responded". A good indicator that you're trying to try is that you are: Most people tell me they've applied for jobs and didn't get responses. Slightly savvier people tell me they've sent some cold emails out. Some people beyond that say they've started attending Meetups but had no luck. None of them have done anything remotely interesting or otherwise indicative of novel thought. I got my first programming job by emailing Josh Wiley from my psychology degree, a man who did not know me at all, but I had been in one lecture with him, and his wife was the only senior academic honest enough to tell me not to undertake a PhD. I still have the original email. We had a brief back-and-forth, and two weeks later one of his colleagues said "One of my PhD students is freaking out because they can't process some data in R", and that got me my first paid programming job, processing microsaccade data in sleep-deprived drivers. A few weeks later, I saw that a data analyst job was up for grabs at a nearby university. The smooth brained thing to do would have been to apply via Seek and get ignored. I instead went on LinkedIn, looked up the company, look up the word "lead" and cold messaged someone who seemed like they might have something to do with the job. This led me to Dave Coulter, who I still catch up every few months, and a job offer that let me skip straight to being a mid-level engineer. During the interview, when they asked "Have you programmed professionally?", I described the microsaccade project and they hired me. I didn't mention that it was about thirty hours of work in total, and they didn't ask. I actually lost the original position to someone with six more years of experience, who was offered the original data analyst role or a much more highly-paid contract. They wanted the stability, so they took the permanent role, leaving me with a massive pay bump for the contract role, and we both quit at the same time anyway. And they do not conceptualize it as losing tends of thousands of dollars, but they were functionally unemployed for months relative to what they could have earned. Score one for contracts. Those still ended up being mediocre jobs, but I just wanted to illustrate that there is a level of trying that looks more like "there is a gun to my head and I'm willing to do unorthodox things to survive", and the people that email me for jobs have never reached the unorthodox part of that. Presumably that people that do reach this point do not need to email me for jobs. I woke up this morning to an email from Dan Tentler from Phobos about safe ways to run Incus with NixOS images pre-loaded with Airflow and an overlay VPN to client sites. Dan learned about Phobos from a group of hackers in Oslo. I learned about overlay VPNs in December from the CTO of Hyprefire, Stefan Prandl, when asking for advice on network security. I have a discussion about something like this every day, even if it isn't in the tech space. Before that, at a relatively "decent" engineering company, the most complex discussion I had was trying to explain to someone that their Snowflake workload was crashing because they were trying to read 2M+ records into a hash map and that this takes a lot of memory. I have learned more in the last three months than I have in the previous three years, basically along every dimension of my profession. I'm trying to catch up for years of working with mediocre performers, and it's hard. It's definitely doable, and remember that I'm doing this while spending half my time on sales so you can do it faster than me, but there is a real cost to not working with really great people. I've studied hard over the past few years, but nothing comes close to just having awesome people around you. This matters because really good teams don't hire total scrubs that haven't taken control of their education. The first job market does not reward skill or personal development. The second one does actually require you to be good. The best offer I've received from a good company (A$185K) was obtained not through Seek, but by meeting my current co-founder Ash Lally during the preparation for a game of Twilight Imperium IV where I absolutely smoked everyone. The only other place that I've considered might be acceptable to settle down, much better than the offer I received through Ash, at was the result of getting coffee with a local reader, then eventually being invited to drinks with their team a few times. We mostly talked about split keyboards and Star Citizen. It has been a few months since I quit my last job, and I used to say all sorts of conciliatory things like "Sure, that engineer is terrible, but most of them are good!", but money talks. I only offered one of them a job with me. In retrospect, most of them had the potential to be good, but enough years in a typical corporate setting will ruin this. When I was 20, people were happy to hire me because I had potential. Now, potential is still important, but it's important that I've at least demonstrated that some of it is manifesting. Many engineers have pathologies that I think make them unsuitable for work on a healthy team, in the same way that some people need to do some self-work to enter a healthy relationship. For example, I know many people who feel guilty taking time off, so they'll burn themselves out without someone constantly getting them to slow down. I'm sympathetic, but a team as small as mine doesn't have time to walk someone through that level of self-harm and still deliver for clients reliably. We help each other through lots of little quirks we need to deprogram out of corporate contexts, but we need to be starting from a place of some progress. An example that Modal's Jonathon Belotti sent my way is that Modal's most high-performing team members will get a two week deadline, then confidently spend the entirety of the first week reading a book on the technology they're about to use. Most engineers I know, including myself a few years ago, would rather hack incompetently for two weeks. The essential reason for this is being too underconfident to act on our beliefs about how engineering should be done (or worse, not having those beliefs at all), and we'd rather fail in the approved, was-working-visibly fashion than risk looking unorthodox. "I programmed the whole two weeks and failed!" feels easier to justify than "I read a book for one of those weeks and failed!". But team members should be picked for their judgement, and if they are good for the team in proportion to the quality of that judgement and their willingness to exercise it in the face of orthodoxy. People are awful at asking for work. Here is how I advise people do it. If you don't have a good time, just leave it be. You're here to rekindle old relationships and meet interesting people, and maybe they can help you out. The moment you start asking people for help that you don't even want as friends is the moment that the entire endeavour becomes sleazy. I think of each person I know (in the context of job searching) as some sort of machine that randomly spits out jobs in a uniform distribution over a year. Let's say each person has a 5% chance of turning up a job every month, maybe more or less depending on the market. If you want an 80% chance at a job every month, you have to have enough people with you in mind that you're rolling the dice enough times to get that number. Many people tell me that they attended a few Meetups and had no results, even though that's what you're supposed to do. It's good that they tried, but most large Meetups seem to be populated by people who are ineffectually looking for jobs. Don't be ineffectual. Large Meetups were frustrating when I was a student because everyone interesting was swarmed by students trying desperately to look employable without being needy, and it is frustrating as a non-student because now I get swarmed. People go "Oh, I am a data scientist, I will go to the Data Science Meetup". That's better than not going out at all, but strictly inferior to going to a tiny Meetup with ten nerds that are deeply into Elixir or some other niche bit of technology. You will form real connections with the latter, and the fact that you know what Clojure is will be enough to make many people at such a place want to work with you. If you are in a city with a functioning tech industry and can't think of any interesting technology, then it's going to be really hard to justify why you deserve a spot on a good team, so maybe solve that problem first. If you're decent at writing and have opinions on something... write. It's amazing for meeting people. I have several readers that have sent me their writing, and without any intervention from me, about 30% of them hit the front-page of Hackernews on the strength of their material. There are surprisingly few people putting out good material on almost all topics, especially in the age of LLM slop. Reader Mira Welner wrote about something as generic as Git checkout and hit the front-page. Bernardo Stein, mentioned in various places on the blog as the guy that coaches me through my worst engineering impulses from my corporate career, has front-paged by writing about NixOS. Nat Bennett, who I've been getting advice from for months and am now hiring to coach my team, front-paged Hackernews writing about the notebook they keep at new jobs. Even Scott Smitelli, who I quoted earlier for having wrote this fantastic piece emailed it to me, and before I could finish reading it people were already recommending it to me through other channels. It's super easy to meet people through writing if you aren't afraid of pushing out your real opinions and indeed, you will see extremely stupid comments on all of the above writing, so you will need to be unafraid. Fine. Tell people that you, personally, are ChatGPT. Someone else may lose their job and think "I wish I hadn't listened to Ludic, he is so stupid and foolish", but I refuse to acknowledge them. ↩ The main one is Gary Donovan who I didn't even meet in the wild. I met a reader for coffee, and that reader worked with a really nice engineering company. That company said Gary is their favourite recruiter. The first time I called him, I said something about Lisp and it turned out he had a copy of The Little Schemer in front of him at that very second, and we later had a great talk about engineering culture in F1 over ramen. I am still reeling at the implications in neuroscience of a recruiter that can read — is it possible that some of them are sentient? ↩ Subscribe via RSS / via Email. Powered by mataroa.blog.
