A conversation with Stanford GSB professor Ilya Strebulaev on embracing disagreement. Venture capital firms notoriously embrace risk and take big swings, hoping that one startup will become a monster hit that pays for many other failed investments. This VC approach scares established companies, but it shouldn’t. Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Ilya Strebulaev says that VC firms have proven best practices that all leaders should apply in their own companies. He explains exactly how VC’s operationalize risk, embrace disagreement over consensus, and stay agile in their decision-making—all valuable lessons that apply outside of Silicon Valley. With author Alex Dang, Strebulaev cowrote the new book The Venture Mindset: How to Make Smarter Bets and Achieve Extraordinary Growth and the HBR article “Make Decisions with a VC Mindset.” Key episode topics include: HBR On Strategy curates the best case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, to help you unlock new ways of doing business. New episodes every week. HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy—case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Is your company slow to make decisions? Afraid of failure, maybe to a fault? A risk-averse mindset can thwart a company’s growth and competitiveness. Stanford Graduate Business School professor Ilya Strebulaev says the antidote is for senior leaders to start thinking like venture capitalists. He talked to Curt Nickisch on HBR IdeaCast in 2024 about what the “venture capitalist mindset” is, and what it can do for businesses. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into the VC mindset and what sets these decision makers apart. One thing that probably anybody would tell you if you ask them on the street is that this willingness to fail, comfort with failure is sort of at the heart of that mindset. Does your research bear that out? ILYA STREBULAEV: It does. Of course, willingness to fail is one of the many principles that we identified that constitute the venture mindset. In fact, the way I think about failure is in terms of baseball. For venture capitalists, home runs matter, and strikeouts don’t. What you’ll see is that out of 20 typical early-stage venture capital investments, most may fail. A few will maybe return the money back, and maybe will earn a little bit. And it’s only one out of 20 that becomes a home run. In one of my venture capital classes at Stanford, we had one quite famous venture capitalist. And he was talking about one of his venture funds that he started back in 1999. And many, many years later, that fund was still going. All of his companies but one failed from that fund. And when students asked that venture capitalist, “So that fund was unsuccessful, right?” And his reply was, “Not at all, because there is still one company that actually is doing very, very well.” And so that company might become a home run. It’s easy to say, “Let’s embrace failure.” It’s much more difficult to implement it in a practical way. So we can think about specific, what we called playbook mechanisms, of how you can implement every single principle of the VC mindset, including how you can implement your approach to failure, so that indeed you concentrate on home runs, and you decide to let go of your strikeouts. CURT NICKISCH: Before we get into that playbook, let’s just talk about this game strategy first. And that is that you’re swinging for the fences, to use the baseball analogy of hitting a home run. That’s an economic model that works, but is it wrong for companies to say, “Let’s try 10 things, and it’s okay if only five of them are moderately successful.” But they’re not. None of them are big hits. ILYA STREBULAEV: The way to think about this principle of home runs met and strikeouts don’t, is not to think about each individual project or each individual experiment, but think about a portfolio of bets that you have. I think when smart venture capitalists make decisions about how they’re going to allocate their budget, very often the most important decision is not about a specific startup, but the most important decision about the portfolio allocation. My first reaction is let’s think about your strategy. Maybe you don’t take enough risk. So recently I worked with one venture fund that’s quite successful, or used to be quite successful. And the fund increased, almost tripled in size, and almost tripled in terms of the number of partners. And the managing partner realized that well, we’re not as successful as we used to be. So they invited me, and I looked at their data. And I quickly realized that their portfolio allocation strategy changed. They no longer made a lot of risky bets. Well, behind that was another principle of the venture mindset, which is agree to disagree. In that venture capital fund, they used to have three partners. Now they had eight or nine partners. And yet they continued exactly the same decision-making process they used to have 10, 15 years ago. And one of the important principles they had is that every single partner should be very enthusiastic about the deal. And with let’s say nine partners, it no longer works. That means that all nine partners must now consent to invest in the deal. And one of the specific recommendations from me was, you have to change this consensus culture. You have to agree to disagree. By the way, there’s a specific playbook mechanism that I recommend, and not just for venture capitalists, but in fact for any organization. And it is called Anti-portfolio. And anti-portfolio means look at the projects that you decided not to implement, and have a look at what happened to those projects. And if your anti-portfolio performs better than your portfolio, I think there’s a good reason to sit back and think what happened. And in a large organization, it’s very similar. You have a lot of internal projects that you then decide maybe not to pursue. Well, have a look what happened to similar projects or similar ideas elsewhere. CURT NICKISCH: So let’s dig into one thing that you just talked about a bit, which was this agree to disagree, which goes against a lot of companies that are consensus driven. And it goes against just this idea, I guess, that if it’s a good idea, everybody should recognize it and come around to it. But if you really try to go with consensus, then you tend to not have very pathbreaking, groundbreaking investments or ventures that you’re developing inside your firm. Is that right? ILYA STREBULAEV: That is right, Curt. I think consensus is very important in the era of stability so that when we all know the final goal, we all have more or less the same information, and none of us expect dramatic changes, then consensus is likely the right approach. But once we face what I call unknown unknowns, once in fact the end goal is unclear. For example, maybe we’re entering the new market. For example, we are trying to adopt a new technology, then consensus is dangerous. CURT NICKISCH: I’m curious what specific things venture capital firms do then to get around this inertia, I guess, of consensus. What do they do to actually support that kind of disagreement and that kind of environment where disagreement can thrive and still let people proceed? ILYA STREBULAEV: They use several very practical mechanisms. The first one is they assign a devil’s advocate. You kind of appoint one person or a small group of people to take the opposite view. In fact, in a group decision making, it’s very often difficult for people to say, “I disagree.” Especially if somebody else is very enthusiastic about the deal, or maybe if the boss is enthusiastic about the investment. So you appoint somebody, and let’s say I’m going to say, “Curt, tomorrow we’re going to discuss this specific project. And it is your responsibility to come up with all possible weaknesses, all possible reasons why we should not pursue this project.” For example, Andreessen Horowitz, a large venture capital firm, also known as A16z very often designates what they call a red team. So they have a blue team that argues for the deal, and they have a red team tasked with arguing against a deal. Now in large organizations, they decide to implement a devil’s advocate, make sure that you alternate who the devil is. If you are going to be appointed as a devil again and again and again, then in fact your influence is going to be diminished over time. Another mechanism that venture capital firms use is what I call a consensus minus X rule. So let’s say going back to the example I gave earlier about a partnership of nine decision makers. Consensus minus X, let’s say consensus minus two means is that the investment will be approved even if only seven people are in favor. So you can set this number depending on the size of the investment. CURT NICKISCH: And so you might even make it smaller than for smaller investments, so that even if one person was in favor of doing it, you could do a seed stage investment, for instance. ILYA STREBULAEV: That is true. That is correct. And in fact, it’s not just about seed investment. Let me give you an example. Venrock, which is a very storied venture capital firm, the firm behind investments in Intel, Apple DoubleClick and many, many other companies. There are a number of partners, and they vigorously debate every deal. And then the partner who initially presented the idea, who is the pioneer of the idea, will have to make the final decision unilaterally. Think about this Curt. There are nine partners, and one partner will hear all the feedback. In fact, you’re facing now eight devils. And then you will have to make your own decision. CURT NICKISCH: I’m going to mention just a couple of other things that I thought were noteworthy in your article about improving this decision-making process. Number one, a lot of VC partnerships try to keep the team small, right? You just improve communication, you improve the speed, and that adding a lot of people to the decision-making process doesn’t actually help you that much. They ask for feedback in advance, some of them, so that people can read up on the companies, see the decks ahead of time, and then weigh in with their thoughts before they discuss as a group. And they also allow junior members of the team to speak first, just so that when the boss speaks, it doesn’t bias people’s opinions or influence the real feedback that they wanted to give. Some of those maybe are good practices that people know about, but I guess it’s important to underline, right? ILYA STREBULAEV: These practices might be well known. It doesn’t mean though that they’re frequently implemented in large organizations. You mentioned keep teams small. In all venture capital firms, teams are always kept very, very small. But in large companies, very often you go into a meeting room and there will be a lot of people. And sometimes you might ask, “What on earth are all these people doing here?” In practical terms, think about the following rule that is implemented in Amazon. Now, Amazon is one of those venture-backed company that retained it’s a venture mindset. Amazon has a very simple rule, two pizza team, so that if you’re still getting hungry after you consume two pizzas, then the team is too large, it’s around eight or ten people. And I think that there is in fact a lot of research that supports this notion. In fact, there’s a lot of research suggesting that maybe the teams should be even smaller. But in a large organization, every single time your decision-making team is more than ten, you have to ask a question why? And most often that will not be an efficient decision. Now, you also mentioned asking for feedback in advance. And in most successful venture capital firms, I observed that. And by the way, it is done for a number of reasons. One is because they would like to minimize the influence of authority. Because Curt, if you’re my boss, let’s say you are the senior managing partner of the venture capital firm, and I’m a junior. And I maybe know something very interesting about this startup or about the founder. I have some really value-add soft information. If you speak before me, then it’s very difficult for me to provide this information if it somehow disagrees with your assessment. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, it becomes you like you’re arguing with that person. ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s right. In fact, where large organizations I think can and should use it is not just when they decide on investments or on projects, but also in the interview process in hiring decisions. Google, again, another venture-backed company that retained its venture mindset has a policy. There is an interview committee when you hire people. The policy is you ask members of those committees to record their comments on each candidate individually in advance of the meeting, so that when you meet, you can have a look at what every single committee member independently said. By the way, sometimes venture capital firms go even further. They request anonymity. And there is something else, which in my experience I find very counterintuitive for let’s say corporate leaders, is that if we have an expert in the room, the natural tendency is to ask the expert first. I’m sure you’ve been Curt, in the meetings where people said, “Well, Curt is the expert, so let’s hear from him what he has to say on this topic.” Venture capitalists very often do exactly the opposite. They’ll say, “Curt is the expert on this specific technology or this specific space. You know what? He is going to speak last.” Because well, you are the subject matter expert Curt, which means that if you say something and I happen to disagree with you, it’ll be much more difficult for me to talk. CURT NICKISCH: Yeah, so much of decision-making in organizations is often about repeating past performance, right? Finding previous patterns and trying to repeat them. It sounds like you’re saying the venture mindset is almost trying to divorce yourself from that, and be open to exceptions, and be open to what’s different and what’s new. ILYA STREBULAEV: In the large organization that deals with innovative projects, you always have to think about designing an efficient portfolio allocation. And try to avoid making an individual micro decisions on every single investment. So in the corporate VC environment, I think the parent company executives should decide on the total budget. They should decide on the number of investments that can be made. They should overall impose criteria, what kind of startups you can invest in, what kind of startups you can’t invest in. That depends on the overall strategy of the firm. But my advice is try to avoid making individual decisions. CURT NICKISCH: The other tip that you have in the article is just to set ambitious timelines. And one thing I hadn’t really understood is that a lot of venture capitalists know that these are highly uncertain deals. You really don’t know how these are going to turn out. In all likelihood, most of these are going to fail. So spending a lot of time thinking about it, trying to game it, and all these different scenarios, it doesn’t actually help you reduce the risk. You just have to make a decision and move on. And so that’s a big recommendation of yours is just to set ambitious timelines, make decisions quickly on these companies that come to you or these investment opportunities, and just move on and not overthink things. ILYA STREBULAEV: Curt, it is my recommendation. But note that I’m not saying that because you have to make decisions quickly, your decisions are going to be inefficient. In fact, venture capitalists came up with ways to make fast decisions very efficiently. And the chapter is titled How to Say No 100 Times. We do say it 100 times, because my research shows that for every startup that venture capital firms invest in, on average they say no, so they turn down 100 opportunities. Just think about this, think about all those thousands of startup investments that they decide not to invest in. And they do it quite efficiently. So very quickly how they do it, is that the venture mindset thinks about the funnel of all the deals in two different ways. The first, at the top of the funnel, you have a lot of deals. And I think of this as 100 to 10, using the automobile terminology, you are going to use a fast lane, which means that you are trying to make a very fast decision here as efficiently as possible. And here is one specific trick that venture capitalists use that I found amazingly efficient, and in all my work with large organizations, I observed that they don’t use this trick typically, before I explain this to them. They ask a different type of question. The typical question that you would ask Curt is, “Okay, here’s an investment. Why we would like to proceed with this investment?” But in the fast lane, 100 to 10 lane, venture capitalists ask a different question. They ask, “Why we should not proceed with this investment?” And just by adding not, it completely changes the picture. So that as long as you find a red flag or a critical flaw, you decide not to proceed with this deal and just move on to another investment. But once you go into what I call a slow lane or 10 to 1 lane, you switch. And venture capitalists very often subconsciously, they in fact, they don’t realize themselves. They switch from asking one question, why we should not invest, to asking another question, which is why we should invest. Or in fact, as one of my VC friends told me, “Why are we greedy to invest?” And then they proceed into relatively slow, still fast, but relatively slow due diligence. And I think that in large organizations you can really implement that approach, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, fast lane, slow lane. And so that the questions you are asking or ask your team to investigate are going to be different at the different levels of the deal or project funnel. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, I want to ask you something about taking on this VC mindset at companies, because it’s different for them, right? Venture capitalists in some ways have it easy, because they’re not employing those people that are doing this. When those companies fail, they’ve lost their money, but they don’t have to pay severance. Often at companies, when you’re deciding on an internal venture, there is opportunity costs. You’re taking some of your employees who aren’t going to be working on other things, and then performance engine, I guess, instead of innovation engine to keep running. Knowing that these decisions are a little more complex just because of the nature of their business. What do you tell them when they feel like it’s just harder, or I have these realities that I have to pay attention to, that just doesn’t seem to factor for a company that’s just investing in companies and doesn’t suffer the same externalities that a corporation does with its own employees? ILYA STREBULAEV: That’s a great question, Curt. First of all, we talked today about several principles of the venture mindset and specific mechanisms, specific ways to implement it. For large organizations specifically, I think you have to take a parsimonious view. In our book, the Venture Mindset, we in fact discussed nine principles. And what I observed especially for large organizations, is that all those principles are interconnected. So that you might want to, as a Chief Executive Officer, let’s say, or a leader in a large company, you would like to get acquainted with all of them to start with. Because I think that will give you a much fuller picture with how to deal with all those complexities. Another point to keep in mind is that if you change the culture of your organization so that people are incentivized both financially and non-financially to pursue home runs in projects, in project teams, then it’ll be much easier to reallocate teams within your company, so that if a project fails as many projects in a large company should fail, it does mean that there will be layoffs. It does mean that there will be severance or separation from workers. It means that your team members are going to be reallocated. And indeed, many large companies pursue this strategy quite successfully in various industries, not just in technological industries. So in a way, I think large organizations, and this might sound counterintuitive, but that is both my observations and outcome of my research. Large organizations in fact, could use the venture mindset more efficiently than venture capital firms. Exactly because, first, unlike venture capital firms, they have a lot of resources. They have the budget, they have the people. Also, unlike venture capital firms, in fact, they can control better what those internal startups, let’s say, those intrapreneurs are doing. So in fact, if you exercise just the right dose of control while at the same time allowing a lot of flexibility, in fact, I think the venture mindset in a large company can flourish much more than even in a venture capital firm. CURT NICKISCH: Ilya, this has been really, really interesting with a lot of great takeaways for companies to copy something that’s successful in an industry that we can all learn a lot from. Thanks so much for taking the time to share your research and your insights with our audience. ILYA STREBULAEV: Thank you, Curt.

Title: It's clear Hasbro, the custodians of D&D, have no idea what to do with Baldur's Gate 3's success—but that's nothing new, it's spent the past 10 years fumbling the bag

The instant collapse of Sigil is just the latest in a long line of missed opportunities and self-inflicted wounds. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Dungeons & Dragons might be, if trends continue, one of the most mishandled success stories I've ever seen. And, if my powers of prophecy are correct, we're starting to approach the low bend of a 10+ year arc where Hasbro, the parent company of D&D owners Wizards of the Coast (WoTC), has continually fumbled the bag in just about every way it possibly could. Usually when I hammer out a timeline like this, I work in chronological order—but we're going to start in media res. It'll actually help us to work backwards: Starting with Baldur's Gate 3. In case you hadn't heard, we rather like Baldur's Gate 3 here at PC Gamer. While not all of us are CRPG-heads, those of us that are would probably consider it one of the all-time greats. Our own Fraser Brown even called it "the pinnacle of the genre" in his Baldur's Gate 3 review. For Hasbro and WoTC, it was the savviest deal possible for the "world's greatest role-playing game"—grabbing one of the best RPG development studios of our time to make something so far up its alley, it's like it was born for the job. Larian Studios, a shining goose to end all geese, spent several years meticulously creating a golden egg. Except in this metaphor, the goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat—wide, panicked eyes looking for a place to actually put it. Their first move? Lay off most of the people who got Larian to make the thing in the first place. Yeah, I don't know either. The goose has now waddled off, leaving Hasbro to run around carrying its egg-treasure with a brow full of flop-sweat." I want to be clear: The idea that Larian decided not to make another Baldur's Gate game because of these layoffs is pure conjecture, and countermand to Swen Vincke's words on the subject. It's clear that the developer simply wanted to move onto games it was more passionate about, lest it consign itself to the geese farm forevermore. Not to mention, there's plenty of reasons why you might want to make your own IP rather than continuing to pay dividends to another company—BioWare did something very similar, hopping from Knights of the Old Republic to Mass Effect back in the day. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But, like, Hasbro can't have helped, right? As a studio, Larian's extremely outspoken about the kind of cost-cutting, short-sighted nonsense it pulled. Bare minimum, it would've been a point in the 'cons' column. Still, as Vincke has demanded—my tinfoil hat is off. The point is, Hasbro won't get another D&D game out of Larian. So what now? A huge amount of TTRPG players have, due to the struggles that come with trying to organise five adults into the same room every week, turned to Virtual Tabletops (VTTs) to get their fix. I'm one of them: Most of my games are online. WoTC decided to muscle in on the territory itself with Sigil—its own glossy VTT, a one-stop shop for all your D&D fun. Sensibly, Hasbro decided to put Baldur's Gate 3's cast in it as minis—which, while kinda kitschy, is in itself pretty cute. There's some table that'd get a kick out of Astarion guest-starring in their campaign, I'm sure. Except Sigil's not going to be the next big thing, and it might barely be a 'thing' at all. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off because, reportedly, "Hasbro treated Sigil like a video game instead of a VTT and at no point cared to understand the difference." So what's Hasbro doing with Baldur's Gate 3? The answer is an uncertain 'er'. Certainly, the line is that they've got exciting news to share just around the corner (who doesn't) but just listen to senior vice president of Digital Strategy and Licensing at Hasbro, Eugene Evans, as he spoke to PCG's own Robin Valentine last year: "I think it's too early to express specifics and I think that there's a much bigger question about how we approach Baldur's Gate in the future … But I would like to think that all of those characters, for the sake of the fans, could potentially appear in future products." And look, taking your time is sensible, but this was nearly a year on from Baldur's Gate 3's release—and Hasbro's plans haven't really moved on much since. To paraphrase, it's been a lot of 'we're thinking about lots of stuff, just trust me, bro'. Sigil went into playtesting with a whimper, didn't quite work, and then Hasbro had 90% of the people making it laid off." I'll tell you what Hasbro is doing: Ramming its feet into PR disasters. Just this week, a Stardew Valley mod had a DMCA flung at it right after Larian's Swen Vincke spoke well of it. They rescinded the strike, mind, but it's a PR blunder that's downright typical of the company by now. More on that later. I think it's clear, at this point, that Hasbro has no idea what to do with the egg. I mean, they put BG3 characters in Magic: The Gathering, because I wager that's one of the few things Hasbro knows how to make money with. But in my mind, what Hasbro needs to do is keep making good D&D videogames with great studios—not simply trotting out Karlach like she's a team mascot. And sure, maybe the company just needs some time to cook—but Hasbro's track record doesn't inspire confidence. This is simply how the company operates, and I predict we're destined to watch a toy and boardgame giant slip on the same banana peel over and over again. Let me take you back in time. It's March, 2015, approaching one year on from D&D's new 5th edition (5e). Now, 5e isn't doing terribly for itself—and, to be fair, WoTC did a solid job. It threw off the stink of 4e's poor sales (and worse community reception) and returned to its roots, grabbing parts of 3.5 and reworking them into a far more accessible package. But Critical Role? Now that was a tidal wave. In case you're unfamiliar, Critical Role is an 'actual play', a live streamed game of D&D run by voice actor Matt Mercer and his equally industry-experienced coterie of enthusiastic nerds. Its first episode aired and, simply put, it exploded. The ravenous beast of fandom sunk its jaws into the thing—heaps of fanart and fanfiction, the kind of liquid lifeblood that sends media properties into the stratosphere. In just a year, each episode of Critical Role had a million minutes watched each. Thousands of viewers would hop in to watch people play D&D live, every week, and suddenly wanted to play it themselves. That's not to say Critical Role was the sole author of this renaissance, mind—The Adventure Zone, itself inspired by a rising tide of D&D podcasting, had started a year beforehand, and it would soon be joined by a flood of excellent podcasts and shows. High Rollers, Dimension 20, NADDPODD, Dungeons & Daddies… Netflix's Stranger Things also helped bring D&D into the spotlight in 2016. But Critical Role by far seems to have made the most out of itself—transforming into a fully-fledged media company with enough chutzpah to crowdfund its own Amazon series. This was very, very good news for Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast—and to be fair, it's not like they didn't make some headway. Critical Role, for example, played a huge part in D&D Beyond's popularity, with routine advertisements for the product. It was ultimately a really smart move for Hasbro to pounce on a digital platform for their game at the height of its popularity. Except they didn't actually do that, did they? Because Hasbro didn't make D&D Beyond, and bought it after it became successful in 2022, but I mean—hey, that's just details, right? Regardless, WoTC continued to quietly enjoy this newfound popularity with adventure books and supplements—some of which were made in conjunction with Critical Role—but that was pretty much it. They benefitted from a whole ecosystem of creators nourished by new fans to the hobby, too, effectively doing free marketing for the game by making their own homebrew tomes full of monsters and rules. Then, in 2023, Hasbro took out a big gun and shot itself in the foot by trying to rewrite its Open Game License so, uh, nobody could do that. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet—until it eventually tucked tail and decided it was being very, very stupid. In April of the same year, it sent the Pinkertons after a Magic: The Gathering player. This did not help. For almost a month, Hasbro became the villain of the TTRPG internet." I'm not going to say D&D had some mass exodus away from the system—quite a few people stopped playing it, but not nearly enough to make a dent. Plenty of the shows from 5e's golden age of streaming are still playing the system because it's nice and comfy. But it's no coincidence that Critical Role would eventually start making its own rulesets like Candela Obscura and Daggerheart, and its Amazon Series has enough legally-distinct departures that Hasbro isn't profiting off it directly. Mind, CR certainly wasn't alone—the OGL blunder drove other companies, known for making D&D material, towards the creation of their own systems instead. Take Kobold Press, one of the most prolific creators of 5e content, which is currently cooking up its own competitor. Paizo's Pathfinder also hopped in to take their share of the dragon's hoard, debuting its own more equitable OGL by the name of ORC. 10 years of success and not a big, Hasbro-original idea to claim credit for. But hey, it's time for WoTC to cook up a new edition—a real chance to inject some new lifeblood into D&D. An opportunity for a fresh take on the formula, maybe? One that borrows popular systems from other RPGs that caught D&D's tailwind and—what's that? It's only a rules revamp? Ah. I've shared my thoughts on the 2024's Player Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual, and I'm not going to waltz in here and tell you any of them are bad. As a matter of fact, I've got plenty of nice things to say about them. The presentation is excellent. WoTC hired a whole host of brilliant artists to beautify their pages in a way that's really very charming—content-wise, it's more of a mixed bag, but there are plenty of screws that have been tightened on the bugbears of 5e's systems to make it more streamlined. You might wince at that statement (it's okay, I'm right there with you) but it's arguably the smartest move based on what D&D has become—which is to say, a jack-of-all trades fantasy game. It has just enough crunch to satisfy the min-maxers, with a simple enough entry that your storytellers aren't hemmed in. It's the "should we just get pizza" of TTRPGs, and in a hobby where the biggest limiter is time commitment, that's an important niche to fill. I could yap about how much I prefer PF2e all day, but let's be real, most tables are going to see its list of 4,000+ feats and get a headache. Still—the fact that WoTC didn't feel confident enough to reinvent much of anything after 10 years signals how paralyzed the entire operation has become, right? After a decade of successes, and after a massive, hobby-wide controversy seemingly couldn't sink it, D&D's next big move was to equip you with basically the same game for the next 10 years. No innovation, no progression, just a slightly different angle to the wheels spinning in the dirt. I might be calling the match a little early, and I want to be clear—I think WoTC has a lot of talented, eager, enthusiastic, and invested designers working for it. But when it comes to Hasbro, the overarching toy-making megagiant, and its leadership? I have vanishingly little confidence it knows what to do with any of its victories. Part of it might just be the fact that TTRPGs are hard to make money with. Hasbro's other properties, like Magic: The Gathering, create enormous value just by existing. Board games also have an easier time transitioning to the digital age, with apps like Monopoly Go! Hauling in $200 million every month in their heyday. Yet it almost feels like D&D is uniquely cursed. Take the movie, for example: Honour Among Thieves. It's really funny, entertaining, and passionate, and it even had broader appeal to a more mainstream audience without upsetting TTRPG vets, something I'd have thought impossible. I unironically really liked it, and would encourage anyone to give it a watch if pressed. It also only made $208 million on a $150 million budget at the box office—if you're keeping score, that's $58 million in profits (less, if that $150 million didn't include advertising costs). Or 1/4th of a month of Monopoly Go! At its prime, even in a best-case scenario where marketing was done cheap. Oof. After 10 years of success largely dropped in its lap, what does Hasbro—or Wizards of the Coast—have to show for itself? Let's tally things up: I don't mean to paint a picture of complete failure here—D&D is by far still the most popular tabletop game, and I don't see that changing any time soon—but the truth is, Hasbro's comical fumbling with Baldur's Gate 3 isn't some new, weird behaviour. It's the norm. This is a company that, from an outsider's perspective, barely understands its own product, doesn't really care to, and is growing increasingly impatient with its inability to turn it into a Magic: The Gathering. There are systems, products, and companies that would kill for D&D's ubiquity and household name—it's just a shame that the people on top are more enthused about how cool AI is than anything else. I'd love to be proven wrong—for Hasbro to make a move that tells me it actually understands the liquid gold leaking out from between its fingers. But at this point I've spent a decade holding my breath—and lemme tell you, I don't think my Con score's high enough to last much longer.

Title: It's not just tariffs. 4 other issues are battering stock market sentiment.

Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market in 2025. While anticipated tariffs have exerted the most pressure in recent weeks, the sell-off has been accelerated by a slew of data points that suggest that the economy is on shaky footing. Here are four factors that are souring the mood among investors as the second quarter kicks off. Consumers are feeling steadily worse about the state of the economy. Consumer confidence dropped for the fourth month in a row in March, hitting its lowest level since 2021, according to the latest Conference Board Survey. The Expectations Index, a broad measure of how consumers feel about the outlook for income, business activity, and the job market, dropped to 65.1 this month, its lowest level in 12 years. That's below a key level of 80, a threshold that has typically signaled a coming recession. CEOs aren't feeling very chipper, either. According to a survey conducted by Chief Executive Group, on average, chief executives rated business conditions in March around 20% lower than conditions in January. Meanwhile, the outlook among CEOs for what business conditions will look like 12 months from now dropped 28% from levels in January, the most pessimistic business leaders have been since 2012, the firm said. The downbeat mood is palpable, and Wall Street is taking notice. "In the US, there is a clear crisis of confidence," Manish Kabra, the head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Events so far this year have led us to highlight our negative views on the Nasdaq-100 and to underline that trade uncertainty is driving our trading call for the S&P 500 to fall to 5555. Most of these events are 'known knowns'. The high-flying AI stocks that have boosted the market in recent years aren't doing so well in 2025. Even before the stiffest tariff headwinds shook up the stock market, investors were questioning the longevity of the trade. In January, DeepSeek, an AI tool from China, surprised markets with a more cost-efficient model to rival US peers like ChatGPT. Since then, investors have been left wondering why the AI "hyperscalers" — companies with big AI ambitions like Meta Platforms and Amazon — have been spending so heavily on chips and other tech. More importantly, they're wondering when they might see a return on such massive capex related to AI. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which has near-equal positions in all the Magnificent Seven stocks, is down 15% year-to-date. By the end of last week, ever Magnificent Seven stock was negative for the year, with Meta the last of the cohort to give up its gains. Doubts have also been swirling for months on whether top AI firms, like Nvidia, will be able to keep up their chip sales in the coming years. "At the top of our list of concerns is the potential for excess comput as well as harsher than expected tariffs and/or export restrictions. We think the keys to the next major move in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will depend on clarity from tariffs," Angelo Zino, a senior analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note on Monday. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred measure, accelerating 2.8% in February, up from the prior month's 2.5% yearly increase. Hotter inflation is bad news on two fronts. For one, it could mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates this year, meaning interest-rate pressure will continue to weigh on stocks. For another, higher inflation is raising fears of stagflation, a worst-case economic scenario that describes a slowing economy with stubbornly high prices. Such a case is even harder for the Fed to deal with than a typical recession, as central bankers won't be able to cut rates to boost the economy without stoking higher prices. In a March Bank of America survey, 71% of fund managers said they saw the risk that the global economy would see stagflation within the next 12 months. The survey also found record stock selling among fund managers, with investors' allocation to the US stock market dropping to their lowest levels in about two years. "Faced with modest stagflation, we think the Fed will stay on hold," strategists said in a note. "Risks are skewed toward weaker growth and even higher inflation." Hiring isn't as strong as it's been in recent years. On top of that, DOGE-related cuts as the government pursues vast budget reduction plans is drumming up uncertainty about future jobs data. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low 4.1% in February, but continued jobless claims have climbed steadily over the past year, according to data from the US Employment and Training Administration. Layoffs also appear to be accelerating. US employers announced 172,017 job cuts in February, a 245% increase from job cuts announced the prior month, and a 103% increase from cuts announced in February of last year, according to data from Challenger, Gray, & Christmas. A weaker job market is stoking fears of a potential recession in 2025, which more forecasters on Wall Street have voiced in recent weeks. In a recent note, strategists from Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast for GDP growth while raising their forecast for unemployment and the probability of a recession this year. "We raised our 12-month recession probability from 20% to 35%, reflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain," the bank wrote in a note.

Title: Googlers have questions for the company after getting smaller pay bumps

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With "Signalgate" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story! On the agenda today: But first: Googlers have questions. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them — Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive — but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and — if you're more junior — there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man — whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." — A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts. More of this week's top reads: VCs are in a 'frenzy' to invest in Anduril, but good luck getting ahold of shares. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: The Inconvenient Truth about H-1B Visas

Time Published: 2025-03-30T04:01:00Z

Americans are told that mass immigration will bring the world’s geniuses to our country. The numbers tell a different story. President Donald Trump's mandate from the voters undoubtedly gives him wide latitude to close the border to illegal aliens, which he has done. Border crossings are down 90 percent and more illegal aliens were arrested in Trump’s first 50 days than across Joe Biden's final year in office. Now, many in the America First movement are asking, “What about reducing legal immigration?” Big Tech moguls Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy accidentally raised awareness of this controversial topic in December by defending—while also calling for reforms to—the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire specialist workers from abroad for up to 6 years. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,” Musk noted on X. Ramaswamy said the “badly broken” program “should be replaced with one that focuses on selecting the very best of the best.” Yet he's also blamed American culture for “venerat[ing] mediocrity over excellence,” justifying the foreign worker program. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” Ramaswamy declared, so “top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans.” The resulting debates were colorful and worth reading, and they revealed a powerful, widespread desire to reduce America's influx of legal immigrants, and not just among America Firsters. A Rasmussen poll published days after the Musk-Vivek ruckus found that 60 percent of likely voters believe America does not need more H-1B workers since the country “already has enough talented people to train and recruit.” That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans, two-thirds of swing voters, and almost half of Democrats. At least one California Democrat in Congress has criticized the H-1B system for rampant fraud and abuse. Trump, for his part, denied a larger share of H-1B applications in his first term (18 percent) than either Obama (11 percent) or Biden (just three percent). Yet he recently praised the program, saying he was “a believer in H-1B” who had used it many times in his business properties. That doesn't mean Trump 2.0 won't scale down the program, though. In March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ruled that visa policies now fall under his purview as “foreign affairs,” allowing him broad discretion to revise visa rules without the drawn-out public notice/comment process. But what are the facts around America's immigration system, and what role do H-1B visas play in it? The H-1B program is capped annually at 85,000 three-year visas, which can be renewed for another three-year term. Estimates put the total number of H-1B workers in the nation at 500,000–600,000 people. At the same time, H-1B holders may apply for lawful permanent residency, allowing them to live and work here indefinitely. The process isn't automatic, but a significant portion—perhaps as high as 90 percent—of H-1B-holders ultimately receive green cards, according to Homeland Security “adjustment of status” statistics. (No one knows the actual figure, apparently.) While the debate that Musk and Ramaswamy kicked off centers on temporary foreign workers, the real debate on the Right should focus on the vastly larger mass-immigration pipeline permitted by our expansive “family reunification” policies. There are roughly 13 million green card holders in the United States, dwarfing the number holding H-1B visas, about half a million. We've admitted more than 1 million more each year since 1990 on average, even during the bleak COVID years of 2020–21. That includes an indeterminate number of H-1B workers. A permanent resident may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years, or three if they marry a U.S. citizen. Between 2021 and 2024, 2.6 million permanent residents became naturalized U.S. citizens, 98 percent of them through the green card process. Once naturalized, however, new citizens may invite in their spouses, married or unmarried children, and even adult siblings—and at 675,000 people per year, the annual immigration cap for family reunification is far larger than any temporary worker program. This is the mass immigration pipeline that a growing number of Trump voters wish to dramatically scale down, if not pause outright and indefinitely as past generations did after periods of intensive migration. We've been in such a period since the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. Since then, the percentage of foreign-born residents has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of 15.6 percent, or 51 million people, today. The mass immigration that the statute enabled has created serious political consequences for the republic. Naturalized citizens made up a record-breaking 1 in 10 voters in the 2024 election and voted at higher rates than native-born Americans. Forty-four percent self-identified as Democrats, compared with just 30 percent who called themselves Republicans. This has been true for decades, which is why leftist get-out-the-vote groups have spent a fortune courting immigrants as part of the Democratic Party's “New American Majority” program. Astonishingly, this aspect of our troubled immigration system has been largely forgotten, yet it's arguably the part that should concern MAGA voters most, given the movement's interest in putting American jobs, education, health, and well-being first. Perhaps far less attention should be paid to the people immigrating on temporary worker visas and more on this massive immigration pipeline of low-skilled workers under the family reunification policy. That doesn't excuse the glaring problems with the H-1B program, of course. Its proponents—such as Musk and Ramaswamy—often market the H-1B program as our nation's only tool for attracting highly sought-after experts, particularly in the tech industry. But the facts tell a different story. The H-1B program is marketed as importing “highly skilled foreign workers” into the United States. But that's stretching things… a lot. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) lists the requirements to apply: Attainment of a bachelor's degree and a sponsorship by a U.S. employer for a job requiring “highly specialized knowledge.” “Highly specialized knowledge” encompasses everything from a general neurology physician earning $380,000 per year down to an accountant paid $22 an hour, according to job listings on Indeed.com. Most of the positions offered to H-1B applicants are in Big Tech, but many are not. And the “nots” include entry-level mortgage assistants, e-commerce account executives, lathe machinists, bridge repair operators, college admissions consultants, AC/DC motor plant technicians, and life insurance call center specialists—jobs certainly fillable by native-born Americans. Speaking of the native-born, in most cases there is no legal requirement for companies to prioritize hiring Americans before foreigners. Nor are companies prohibited from replacing American employees with (presumably cheaper) H-1B workers, so many do. In 2022 alone, U.S. companies hired 34,000 new H-1B employees while laying off tens of thousands of Americans. Among them was Elon Musk's Tesla, which requested 2,000 new H-1B visas at the same time it was laying off 15,000 U.S. employees last April. The number one H-1B employer is Amazon at 9,265 foreign hires, per the USCIS list of H-1B employers and their total visa employees. Number two is the Indian tech multinational Infosys. This foreign company may be based in Bangalore, yet it's imported over 8,100 H-1B visa workers into the U.S. Infosys has a checkered past: In 2013, the company paid $34 million in a settlement with federal authorities for illegally using B-1 visitor visas for work requiring H-1B visas. Infosys admitted no wrongdoing. In 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with California for again funneling nearly 500 employees into the state on B-1 visas, instead of H-1B visas, avoiding paying payroll taxes or disability and unemployment insurance. It's a similar story with the third-biggest H-1B employer: Cognizant Technology Solutions, an Indian tech company that's imported over 6,300 foreign workers into the U.S. In 2024, whistleblowers sued the company for discriminating against 2,000 American workers over imported Indian employees. Not surprisingly, 73 percent of H-1B visa holders come from India and 12 percent from China, countries famous for their ethno-nationalism and highly restrictive immigration systems. Those nations rarely offer citizenship or even permanent residency to foreigners. “I definitely knew it was because of me being an American, not being Indian, and also because I was black,” said one woman who was fired by Cognizant three days after suing the company. A jury agreed with her. While U.S. law clearly protects H-1B workers from discrimination by employers, there's far less scrutiny on employers discriminating against native-born workers in visa holders' favor. Fortunately, the Trump administration has begun cracking down on the practice. But conservatives should ask, “Is it enough?” Other H-1B employers are less shady but their actions will still make conservatives bristle. Hitachi Energy (visas: 45) is a Swiss renewable energy firm that prioritizes “sustainability” and a “commitment to human rights” on the march “towards carbon-neutral” power in line with “the UN's Sustainable Development Goals” on global warming. Similarly, Schlumberger (visas: 97) is a French multinational oil producer “accelerating decarbonization” to “reduce emissions . . . on the journey to net zero.” Again, these are foreign companies outsourcing American jobs to foreign workers… in America. At least these positions are filled by only the best and brightest, bringing much-needed talent to bolster America's economy. But across the country, many more jobs are filled by the luckiest, not the most talented. Every year the H-1B program is flooded with 386,000 applications by individuals who meet its minimum standards. Of these, 65,000 are selected by lottery, while another 20,000 are picked at random from a pool of applicants with master's degrees. Wily companies game the system, using staffing agencies to hire thousands of foreign workers desperate to enter the United States and get a shot at permanent residency and U.S. citizenship, while big companies get lower-cost employees who can't afford to leave. Critics on the right and the left have blasted this system as a revival of indentured servitude. If visa holders lose their job, they have 60 days to find a new position—and a sponsor—or risk overstaying their visa. Consequently, “H-1B workers can't complain too much” about lower wages, writes Peter Van Buren in The American Conservative. “Unable to change jobs freely . . . they have to take what they are given.” Not only experts and analysts, but also everyday people, take issue with the H-1B system. On Reddit, a social media app popular among young people, several users have bluntly criticized the program. An example: H1Bs are a way for firms to force job loyalty through indentured servitude (in spirit) and increase bottom lines by undercutting the acceptable salary range of the already existent American workforce. It's not to fill roles that they can't fill through American labor [due to] lack of availability, that's just the Trojan horse. Then there's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). “Elon Musk is wrong,“ he tweeted in January. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire “the best and the brightest,” but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.” There are solutions to at least some of these problems. The Trump administration could raise the H-1B salary floor to stop foreign hires from undercutting Americans, prioritize the highest-paid positions to mitigate the lottery's “crowding out” effect, and weight certain industries above others. None of these fixes require shutting down the visa program entirely, but they would go a long way toward addressing its problems. But defenders of the system want to expand the H-1B cap, believing it the best way to discover the world's next Einstein. Yet the U.S. actually has a separate visa specifically for “extraordinary” individuals: the EB-1 “Einstein” visa, which grants permanent residency to 40,000 of the most gifted Olympic athletes, researchers, surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners each year. These are unquestionably the “high achievers” most Americans want to attract. Which raises the question, why invite so many middle-class, white-collar jobs through H-1B—particularly at a time of mass tech lay-offs? That's the question bothering so many 20- and 30-something men, a demographic sprinting towards Trump and the new Republican Party in search of hope, opportunity, and dignity. Recent tech industry lay-offs suggest H-1B visas, even if they worked as marketed, aren't needed—or wanted—in the current economy, especially if they lead to layoffs for hard-working Americans. In late February alone, healthcare, cybersecurity, and computer part manufacturers cut 6,000 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced restructuring plans affecting an additional 6,000 jobs. That's small fry compared with the 380,000 U.S. tech workers laid off between 2022 and 2024, led by Tesla, Intel, and Cisco. Partly this was the result of letting go of extra hands that had been hired during the COVID pandemic to meet ballooning consumer demand, which has since dropped off. Other firms fear a looming recession, so are cutting labor costs to preserve critical cash reserves. Experts expect more lay-offs to come in 2025. A jobs shortage would argue against importing more middle-skill workers. “There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers,” argues the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports H-1B reform. “The H-1B program has transformed over time from a means to supplement the American tech workforce to a means of cheaply replacing it. Americans who are replaced by H-1B guest workers are often forced to train their replacements or risk losing their severance.” At the same time, the center points out, “foreign STEM workers often come from sham universities abroad—particularly in India—and have far fewer specialized skills than they claim.” The center records the stories of 11 different American tech workers unnecessarily replaced by “underqualified” foreign hires. “99 percent of people with H visas are totally underqualified. No skills. I worked with so many of them from Infosys. There are millions of Americans who could do this work,” one Seattle worker writes. “If we said anything, they'd accuse us of being racist, using the company's anti-discrimination policies,” laments another woman laid off from her insurance job. Immigration policy is almost always a numbers game, and a large segment—if not a majority—of the America First movement wants significantly fewer immigrations… or perhaps just few, period. The discussion around H-1B policy both illuminates and obfuscates this. On the one hand, the resentment felt by Americans whose jobs have been outsourced in their very own country suggests the Right wants to go beyond deporting illegal aliens and tighten immigration altogether. On the other hand, too much public discussion is hung up on the relatively modest number of H-1B workers, instead of the million low-skill immigrants who flood in legally each year simply because a family member happens to live here. Sixty percent of green card holders entered either as immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen or through “family-sponsored preferences.” These are decidedly not the world's “best and brightest” doctors, engineers, or AI experts. Chinese and Indians combined comprise just 11 percent of the lawful permanent resident population, whereas Mexicans, Dominicans, Filipinos, and Cubans together make up 36 percent, with Mexicans as the plurality. Nor are they vibrant, young workers with decades in the career force ahead of them: Just 20 percent of green card holders are 34 or younger, while 57 percent are age 35–64. Even without U.S. citizenship, they're entitled to Social Security benefits such as retirement and disability if they worked in the U.S. for at least ten years. This is the consequence not of prioritizing merit, as is often argued, but of the mass immigration system created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The H-1B fight is really over two different visions of America: Is it a special economic zone without borders or a concrete identity (America the idea), or are we a distinct people with a history, language, culture, and tradition (America the nation)? For MAGA, the answer will make all the difference in the world. Hayden Ludwig is the director of policy research for Restoration of America.
