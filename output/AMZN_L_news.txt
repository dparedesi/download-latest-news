The books world is has been full of labor action in the last few years, most recently with Quirk Books voting to form a union with the NewsGuild and Abrams Books winning their vote to form a union with the UAW. Bookstores have especially been at the forefront of this push to organize. On May Day I went to an event at Verso’s offices featuring unionized booksellers talking about their work and their organizing. One fact jumped out at me: over 40% of all bookstores in New York City are unionized, which is four times the nation average. That 40% is likely about to be even higher with the news that The Center for Fiction just won voluntary union recognition. How did bookstores in New York get to such a high union density? I spoke to five bookstore workers in NYC about their experiences organizing, how COVID changed the perceptions of their work, and how they find inspiration in each others’ struggles. Thanks to Aaron, Pilar, Henri, Joe, and Maritza for taking the time to talk to me. Their responses, which were so in depth and thoughtful, have been edited for length and clarity. Aaron Lascano, shop steward, writer, game designer, and Senior Bookseller at Barnes & Noble Union Square, RWDSU Maria Pilar Beddall, bookseller at Book Culture, with RWDSU Henri Seguin, bookseller at The Center for Fiction, RWDSU Joe Gross, poet and Lead Visual Merchandiser at The Strand, UAW Local 2179 Maritza Montañez, improviser and buyer at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, RWDSU AARON: I wanted to organize a union at Barnes & Noble because every single one of my coworkers deserved to be treated and paid better … workers at other companies like Amazon and Starbucks had begun their own union campaigns to win better pay and working conditions. They showed us the path forward—the only way to regain power in the workplace and to bring your employer to the bargaining table is to unionize. HENRI: I had been asking around about a union because I came from Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. (Editor’s note: They started their own union!) Elliot Bay had this really wonderful structure they had started during COVID and fought for during that crazy time. So they were just total seasoned veterans of union work and the benefits that it brought to the space … So I came in [to The Center for Fiction] very eager and with some backgrounds in that work. And then getting into the Center, it was lot different than I expected. It’s not just a bookstore, it’s also a cafe, and it’s also a nonprofit. And so although it’s a small organization, I saw a lot of the same issues as at Elliott Bay … And then there was a big renegotiating of contracts at the end of the year. A lot of shuffling around that—you know, I can’t totally speak to everyone’s experience—but my own, I was told one thing and then didn’t get that in terms of pay … It was a big upset and we started discussing how to fix this, and how the Center can work in the long term, because it just didn’t feel, without the union, like it had longevity in the system. So we saw [the union] as a tonic to fix these structural issues. PILAR: We need unions, we have always needed unions, without them we have no real chance of a better, more just future. MARITZA: Most of my extended family has spent decades in physically demanding jobs, and many of their hardest jobs as migrant or seasonal farm workers offered the fewest protections. I took their stories to heart and cared about worker rights sort of implicitly. I didn’t anticipate organizing myself, but working in retail changed me a lot and made me more comfortable talking to people, including my coworkers. Eventually it became clear that we wanted similar things from our jobs, and that it would be safest to advocate for ourselves with formal union protections. JOE: In short, non-union life is no kind of life. AARON: I think I talked a lot about a union as stability. A union contract sets pay and certain policies clearly, meaning you’re no longer at the whims of management. You can bargain out policies to protect people in case of layoffs or store closure (which we did), you can bargain for more safety training and a clear banning policy (which we did). Without a union, we felt like bookselling wasn’t a job you could depend on for more than a year. JOE: We talked about precarity. We talked about being the lowest paid unionized booksellers in the city, which had become common knowledge inside and outside the shop as people who worked or applied to work at other shops filtered through. …We talked about how many of us worked two jobs or picked up freelance assignments to make ends meet. A bargaining committee member who wanted to continue working at The Strand but couldn’t afford to left the store early in negotiations and returned home—we talked about that. MARITZA: Our earliest conversations were casual in tone, validating, and a huge relief. One of my coworkers got a handful of BIPOC booksellers she trusted from both stores to join a Zoom after her last day at the store, and we essentially had a three-hour venting session as our first meeting. After that, our meetings got much more structured but it felt very much like we were looking out for one another and trying to make meetings as easy as possible to attend. PILAR: Because we need to! The threat of Bezos, and the more existential threats posed by capitalism and the government mean that the interests of booksellers and the literal work of book selling is more important than ever. And probably in the face of Trump and everything else, owners and bosses seem much less formidable. JOE: My longtime friend since elementary school, Aaron Lascano, was working at Barnes & Noble Union Square and helping to negotiate his bargaining unit’s first contract while I was assisting with Strand workers’ contract renegotiations, and of course we spoke to each other about our various victories and defeats until eventually we got members of our bargaining committees into a room together and began trading information. We showed up for each other’s rallies and pickets where we could, and RWDSU research…confirmed our suspicions that Strand workers were earning less than any other unionized booksellers in the city. The big takeaway from their reporting, though, was that upwards of 40% of all book shops in NYC were unionized, which is extremely high for any industry and opens a world of possibility in terms of contract alignment, the creation of industry-wide standards, and a base from which to organize related industries. AARON: I think that part of it has to do with the types of workers that bookstores draw. There are plenty of students working at my shop, but there are also a lot of working artists (writers, actors, etc.), as well as people who have previously held unionized jobs as mail carriers, truck drivers, and teachers … We also are kind of in a bookstore resurgence–in NYC, B&N is really coming back, but the smaller stores are seeing it too. So we’re working harder days, moving more product and talking to more people, and we’re not seeing our pay rise with the rise in sales and work unless we unionize. HENRI: Bookstores and the larger literary world is an industry of passion and personal interest. It’s very easy to gloss over a lot of issues because you’re sharing your love of literature, and of books, and you have a community of like-minded people around you. But the thing about COVID is that it really stripped us down to “oh, no, it’s a service industry job.” It’s minimum wage, you’re under the heel of a lot of pressures, and you don’t have a lot of agency when it came down to it… you’re doing something you love, but you’re not treated in a loving manner. MARITZA: It almost feels cliche to say, but I really do think the pandemic pushed a lot of people to act on their values. The economy and our industry shut down and stripped away some of the biggest perks that come with bookselling and left a lot of booksellers with just the toughest parts of our jobs. I think a lot of us had similar experiences: we lost the higher paying jobs and gigs that subsidized our low bookseller wages, and we either risked our health for low wages or got laid off by employers who received PPP loans. Many of my newer coworkers came from other industries that also got shaken up by the pandemic and were surprised by conditions so many booksellers accepted as industry standards, and that really reframed our expectations as well. JOE: And we read. Anyone who reads history knows the only reason any workers anywhere have any sort of rights is because past workers formed unions, and radical, militant ones at that. AARON: I was most surprised by how quickly people were willing to step up. Bargaining took about a year and half, and in that time, we had a lot of different people volunteer their time to help run the union. Even as new people got hired at B&N, they’d immediately get involved by coming to bargaining and making time to meet with the committee. Keeping any shop organized is difficult and time consuming, and it can only be done if workers step up to make it happen. JOE: Organizing tests whether you’ll show up for something that’s possible but not yet probable, and every one of my comrades did. MARITZA: I was anxious about talking to people who might think bookselling is too easy a job to organize, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many workers in other industries immediately understand that bookselling is worth unionizing. More and more people agree that workers benefit from unions regardless of what industry they work in. HENRI: It’s been really encouraging to see the different workers and my colleagues step up in really encouraging ways. You know someone through their function at work, but the union work has really broadened that perspective. I’ve seen my colleagues and now my friends stay up late,wake up super early, plan all sorts of sort of contingencies and write drafts letters. And to see that work was a reflection of our commitment to The Center and its mission, it just makes the workspace feel a lot more purpose driven and inviting. AARON: I’ve been inspired by the progress we’ve made as a unionized industry. In NYC, the RWDSU now covers B&N, McNally Jackson, Book Culture, and Greenlight. I’ve started organizing meetings with shop stewards from those stores and also Strand (covered by the UAW), so we can begin having conversations about building a new standard. I firmly believe that, if unions are to really make headway and regain power in this country, they need to provide a robust vision for working people. It can’t just be about raises, it has to be about reclaiming power, reclaiming dignity, reclaiming time from our jobs. And to get there, to really get contracts that can change people’s lives, unions have to link arms and act in concert with one another. We have to bargain together, picket together, and strike together. We have to re-learn what solidarity means and how to effectively perform solidarity. JOE: So many people showed up for us when our negotiations stalled and we went on strike: the patrons who boycotted the store, comrades from Alamo Drafthouse, Cinema Village, and Nitehawk Cinemas who are currently negotiating their own contracts, comrades from UAW Region 9A and UAWD, comrades from the RWDSU, and socialist elected officials from across the city including Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. I’m grateful, and I think people are realizing the existential importance of organizing outside traditional political structures, and unions are key to providing alternative avenues of engagement. Unions should not be siloed in singular shops. They are political vehicles, and the most obvious ones at that. MARITZA: It’s been inspiring to recognize that we’re part of a larger labor movement. The organizer who worked most closely with us at Greenlight also worked with Amazon workers in Bessemer, and that was humbling for me. I am sappy so the things that most inspire me are hearing my coworkers advocate for each other or praise each others’ work. I also love little and tangible things, like so many of my coworkers got new and long-overdue glasses after our first contract because the company agreed to a vision plan for part-timers, and that felt like a small but important and immediately actionable win. MARITZA: My advice is to do it! And more specifically: make space for your coworkers to talk. Not everyone is comfortable complaining about work, especially at work– give your coworkers a safe place to talk, maybe on Zoom or some bar where their complaints won’t be overheard by the wrong people at the wrong time. Then give people some grace while you find common ground. Very practically, I’d recommend researching similar workplaces that have unions and find a contact there to start walking you through what you need to do (and stress that you want to be discreet). If you’re in an industry that hasn’t historically had many unions, think about what the day-to-day of your work looks like, and see if there are parallels in another industry. AARON: Before I started my own journey, all I could think about was how much better my coworkers deserved. I knew that we could and would win this campaign, that we could and would improve our lives. But I didn’t anticipate how our campaign would ripple outwards. The militancy of the B&N campaign, which involved actions including delegations, practice pickets, and a couple of walkouts, made conditions more favorable for other union campaigns to push back against their bosses. We rallied and picketed with Strand, took note of the concessions their bosses made to them, and then the concessions our bosses made to us were noted by other bookstores that were re-negotiating their contracts. The work that we did at B&N Union Square, B&N Park Slope, B&N Upper West Side, Strand, etc., didn’t just improve our individual stores. It helped improve the lives of hundreds of workers around NYC. JOE: Talk about the shit that sucks. Don’t get any lofty ideas to start with; just complain to and commiserate with each other about every little and big way your job drains you and disrespects you and you’ll find that Baldwin quote about Dostoevsky proven true: your pain and heartache aren’t unprecedented in the history of the world and you share the path toward their alleviation. And never, under any circumstances, accept a tiered contract. PILAR: Do it, talk to each other, ask questions, reach out to members, and remember that no one has ever relinquished power willingly, even for things as small as better hours, or more holiday time. AARON: I am reading Roberto Bolaño’s Savage Detectives. I’m Latino, and I’ve been spending more time reading and thinking about Latino history, politics, and culture. I think Bolaño does an incredible job at capturing the fallout of American-backed coups and American imperialism in Latin America. PILAR: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. JOE: Andrei Platonov’s Chevengur, which is a novel of ardent ennui that follows the forays of the October Revolution into the expanse of the Russian steppe and the people navigating that horizon, the space between the joining of a fight that was always going on whether they acknowledged it or not and the future they hope to win from it. MARITZA: I’m currently reading Miriam Toews’ A Truce That Is Not Peace and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s Cursed Daughters. HENRI: One that I adored is this very strange book called One or Two by H.D. Everett. It’s [published] by Mandylion Press who highlight lost feminist and female writers, and this book is about a woman who, in order to lose weight, exorcises her body, and then that exorcised clump of weight that she loses gains sentience and haunts her. And it’s also probably the most beautiful book binding I’ve seen in a long time. It’s an absolutely gorgeous little book. AARON: Solidarity is altruism, faith, strength … You engage this fight not knowing where it will go, not knowing that you’ll succeed, but knowing that you have a moral obligation to stand with fellow workers… it begins with the basic understanding that our fight is one fight, and that an injury to any worker is an injury to every worker. HENRI: For me, solidarity is just very simply showing up when things get hard. Especially just across the nation, there’s been a lot of examples of moments where showing up is the hardest thing to do, but it is the most important thing. And I’ve seen it at The Center, which is really wonderful. I’ve seen workers who are at their limits reach out for help and people lift them up… it’s kind of banal, but I think that’s it’s very at its core it’s just showing up when it’s hard. JOE: Solidarity is a full and complete commitment to causes that nominally are not your own because you realize that every human cause is of mortal importance when you live in the same time and space and can only affect a real reduction in suffering by collectively exerting the power of all peoples. Either everyone has unalienable rights or no one does. MARITZA: For me, solidarity means mutual support, a willingness to take risks for one another and protect one another, and a feeling of investment in each other’s well-being. PILAR: Solidarity means remembering that we are not alone in the struggle, that victories have been won before and will be won again, as long as we fight together.

Title: Google Has Reportedly Cut its Smart TV Budget by 10%

Google has reportedly cut the budget of its smart TV team by 10%, according to a report from The Information, citing people familiar with the situation (via Android Police). The budget cuts are said to be linked with recent layoffs at the Google TV division, despite Google planning to revamp the smart TV platform with its Gemini AI later this year. Google TV is what powers the Google Chromecast with Google TV, the new Google TV streamer, and various smart TVs and media players made by third-party manufacturers. Back in September, Google announced that there are now over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices on the market. However, it’s hard to see Google taking its smart TV platform as a priority despite aggressive competition from Amazon, Roku, and built-in software experiences from Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS).

"*" indicates required fields Δ Still, a Google representative shared the following statement with The Information. “We continue to invest in Google TV with new user experiences including the upcoming integration of Gemini. There are more than 270 million Android TV devices, and we remain committed to growing this ecosystem with an exciting road map ahead.” According to the report, the budget cuts affecting Google’s smart TV team come at a time when the company is focusing more on YouTube as its main entertainment platform. Earlier this year, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan boldly claimed that “YouTube is the new television,” with TV now being the primary device for YouTube viewing in the U.S. YouTube also brings Google a lot of revenue through advertising and premium subscriptions like YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which has 8 million subscribers in the US. The Information reports that Google would like to take the platform into new directions to better compete with streaming platforms like Netflix. YouTube recently hired long-time Disney executive Justin Connolly as its global head of sports and media. The move quickly led Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against YouTube and Connolly. Laurent is a Senior News Editor at Thurrott.com.

Title: If you think your job is hard right now, try working in HR
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-hr-workers-miserable-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-24T08:35:03Z

Over the past 18 months, Evan Loveless has led seven rounds of layoffs, personally informing hundreds of his ad-agency colleagues that they were being let go. "It's a chronic feeling of sadness because it's so frequent for me," said Loveless, a senior human-resources partner in St. Louis. "It's like being stuck under a raincloud." Loveless recalled a particularly soul-crushing layoff conversation with a worker who thought he was reaching out with news about a promotion. "Sometimes the person's husband or wife also just lost their job," he said. "You see their faces and then their faces haunt you a little bit." Working in HR has never been glamorous, as the occupation often requires enforcing unpopular company rules and decisions. Now, HR professionals say the job is getting downright ugly. Unceasing layoffs, stricter return-to-office mandates, immigration raids in the workplace, and a sudden need to help everyone master AI are among the latest challenges upending their workloads. "It's a confluence of events that are occurring simultaneously, the likes of which and magnitude of which I never have observed in my more than 30 years of being a human-capital leader," Jim Link, chief human resources officer for the Society of Human Resource Management, told Business Insider. The new rigors come after another tumultuous period for HR workers. During the pandemic years, they suddenly had to develop and manage remote-work set-ups, grapple with anti-vaccine pushback, and deal with employee tensions and calls to action following the murder of George Floyd. Today, HR teams are juggling even more, said Tracy Brower, a Ph.d sociologist in Michigan who researches organizational behavior. "The demands on HR today are significant, increasing, and intense," said Brower. One of the new tasks HR is having to deal with is the impact of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the workplace. Several times a week foreign workers now come to Alexandra Valverde, an HR director for a midsize food manufacturer in the Southeast, with concerns about getting swept up in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Some have tears in their eyes. "This is the hardest year I've had in HR," said Valverde, who's been working in the industry since 2019. "The fear I'm seeing from employees, even if their status is completely fine — that is something I hadn't experienced before." The steady drumbeat of layoffs is also particularly unsettling for HR workers at companies with staffers on H1-B visas, which allow foreigners to temporarily live and work in the U.S. if they meet certain criteria. "It's never easy to lay anybody off, but it's even harder when you're telling someone they're probably going to leave the country," said Mike Smart, an HR executive at a California tech company. Upon losing a job, H1-B workers typically have just 60 days to find another employer or face deportation. "Even in the best of job markets, 60 days isn't ample by any stretch," said Smart. As of May, employers have announced 696,309 job cuts this year, an 80% increase compared with the same period last year, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Making matters worse, the cuts are coming at a time when company chiefs are warning of even more layoffs coming down the line due to the rise of generative AI and AI agents. Last week Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company's extensive use of the technology is expected to reduce its total corporate workforce, which totaled approximately 1.5 million last year. CEOs of other companies, including chatbot maker Anthropic, freelance-job site Fiverr, and payments provider Klarna, have recently issued similar declarations. HR workers are used to taking heat for implementing policies that don't sit well with workers. But lately they say it's gotten a lot harder to keep their cool. In the second quarter, employees at organizations that experienced layoffs in the past year committed 67% more acts of so-called workplace incivility on average than those at firms without such cuts, according to new SHRM data. Those acts, which the trade group says includes silencing and excessively monitoring colleagues, were also 63% higher among workers at organizations with return-to-office mandates than at those without. David Gaspin, the head of HR for a commercial real-estate company in New York, said that at his previous employer he was hit with "some serious vitriol" from a colleague he thought he had a good relationship with after having to lay this person off last year. The tongue-lashing included comments such as "you're just a corporate tool" and "you're a horrible human being." "That's never easy to hear," said Gaspin. Given the more taxing landscape, it's perhaps no wonder that fewer people are looking for work in HR. Searches for HR jobs on Indeed.com in the first half of this year were down nearly 5% from the first half of 2024, and they've been declining annually since 2021, Indeed data show. Separately, a 2022 study from LinkedIn found HR had the highest turnover rate of any job function. (The job site hasn't updated the report since then.) Rebecca Taylor, a former HR professional in New Jersey who co-hosts a podcast called HR Confessions, said one reason she left the field is that she was tired of always being the office grinch. The final straw came after a worker she was tasked with laying off looked up her parents' landline and called them repeatedly to chastise her. "It was scary," said Taylor, who uses a pseudonym partly because of that incident. If a disgruntled employee is angry enough, she added, what else will they try to find? Jump to

Title: A Postcard from Cannes Lions: Power Struggles, Winners, and AI

This year’s Cannes Lions, the ad industry’s biggest festival, unfolded against a backdrop of upheaval and anxiety. The industry is at a critical moment—facing “an existential crisis,” as S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell told ADWEEK’s editors—but little of that fear was present on stage. While celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Schwarzenegger took center stage, and teams posed with gold trophies on the red carpet, executives on the ground spoke with ADWEEK about issues such as AI, agency consolidation, and layoffs. The event was also marked by an aggressive land grab, both for literal pieces of the Croisette and for marketing budgets. Certain power struggles were visible throughout the festival: Adobe versus up-and-comer Canva, both of which upped their budgets for activations this year. Amazon versus… everyone else. And Michael Kassan’s 3CV versus his former company, MediaLink. Even in the creative awards, rivalries–such as that between holding companies Publicis Groupe and WPP–were on display. Publicis Conseil, a jewel in the crown of the former holdco, won both Agency of the Year and the Titanium Grand Prix, while WPP was named Creative Company of the Year. In the latest episode of Adspeak, the ADWEEK editorial team reports from the sandy beaches and hot pavements of Cannes about who came out on top at the festival, what’s behind the parties and beachfront activations, and what Cannes says about where the industry is headed.

Title: Amazon Ramps Up Enshittification With Even More Ads On Prime Video

(Mis)Uses of Technology Back in early 2024 Amazon announced that Prime Video customers (who already pay $140 per year) would be charged $3 extra every month just to avoid ads that didn’t previously exist. It was just the latest example of “enshittification” in a streaming sector all out of original ideas, desperate to provide Wall Street with impossible skyward quarterly growth — regardless of consumer annoyance or brand harm. When originally announced, Amazon promised it would try to keep the ad load to three-and-a-half minutes per hour to try and be less annoying than its competitors. But the march toward enshittification yields to no one; 18 months later and Amazon has already doubled that volume of advertisements per hour: “According to six ad buyers and documents reviewed by ADWEEK, the current ad load on Prime Video now ranges from four to six minutes per hour. And while that could bring down CPMs, buyers will be watching whether this impacts user experience.” In the modern era it’s simply not allowed for a public company to offer people an affordable product everyone really likes. The unyielding pressures for quarterly growth at any cost inevitably result in the cannibalization and enshittification of most of your favorite products. It’s obvious everywhere; but particularly in newer industries (like say, video streaming) that were disruptive just a few years earlier. Amazon has told eager investors but hasn’t bothered to communicate the latest enshittifcation to consumers yet. When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) and if it was it would be okay because Amazon is focused on “improving ad experiences”: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” As new growth in streaming customers has slowed down, giant media companies have relegated to seeking old ways to give Wall Street their sweet, sweet, improved quarterly returns. That means not just price hikes, but layoffs, pointless mergers, less money spent on content and residuals (meaning they’re too cheap to keep popular programs online), and crackdowns on things that used to be consumer benefits, like the lax treatment of things like password sharing. The short term stock boosts and tax gains from this kind of gamesmanship and consolidation disincentivizes execs from learning anything useful from the experience. By the time consumers begin a backlash and the brand begins to tank, the executives who led the charge are already off working at a different company on the basis of their “savvy deal-making prowess.” It’s purely extractive and utterly pathological. Consumer interest, employee welfare, and the long term integrity or quality of the brand or product simply have nothing to do with it. In this case, streaming companies are going to keep pushing their luck until piracy sees a massive resurgence (which is already starting to happen), at which point the executives will blame everyone and everything but themselves. Instead of any sort of self-awareness of the doom cycle they participate in, they’ll do something even more harmful: like lobbying Congress to make VPNs illegal. Filed Under: ad load, advertisements, amazon prime, competition, consumers, enshittification, streaming, tv, video Companies: amazon Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown So they’re going to stop showing ads? Hold on, they didn’t say they were gonna do that—just that they’re “committed to” doing it, whatever that means; it’s certainly not a guarantee you can collect on. And, of course, they didn’t say it would be an improvement for the viewers. Maybe they’ll “improve ad experiences” for the advertisers, but I suspect the real improvements be for their own employee-bonuses and for Jeff Bezos’s pocketbook (which may imply accidental short-term benefits to minor shareholders, too). Thank God! I sure was getting bored of watching shows without ads! Giving up Amazon Prime turned out to be much easier and painless than I expected, and that was before they started enshittifying in earnest. Amazon in general turns out to be ridiculously easy to walk away from. I highly recommend doing so. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.

When asked for comment by Adweek, Amazon offered a redundant lie about how total ad load isn’t increasing (it is) […]: “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown,” said an Amazon Ads spokesperson. “While demand continues to grow, our commitment is to improving ad experiences rather than simply increasing the number of ads shown.” This is not a lie, just your standard marketing double-speak. It doesn’t say what Karl says it does. It never actually says ad load isn’t increasing, or won’t be increasing. Rather, it avoids the question entirely, and answers an unasked question about their “commitment” instead. Even their “commitment” is compatible with increasing the number of ads shown, as long as they’re not “simply” doing that. “Improving ad experiences” (for whom?) could include increasing the number of ads. That’s not “simply increasing the number”; it’s increasing the number, combined with doing some other stuff. People have been complaining about the enshittification of Amazon’s shopping site for about a decade now, to no avail. Apparently, counterfeit products are a big concern. I don’t shop there, but I do come across Amazon links from search engines sometimes, and it’s astounding how often (for the last year or two) I’ve seen errors about something failing on Amazon’s end, and asking me to try again. When it does work, even if the search has a brand name, the screen’s often full of other brands instead, and I have to scroll to find whatever the search was for. And most reviews aren’t without logging in now. The thing to remember about Amazon Prime is that most of its customers probably never subscribed because of the streaming. They subscribed for the free shipping, and maybe at some point started watching the video service because it was bundled. If Amazon can get them to not watch the video service, but to stay subscribed, that’s the ideal outcome. Youtube already have dominated the news about war against adblocking, copied Hulu’s pause ads on TV and mobile app, and introduced double non-skip ads. Amazon charges you AND serves you ads. If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads (other than sponsors content within the video, if the content creator does that). BIG difference there. You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! You’re just one person, and evidence suggests this is not a widespread view. Newspapers and magazines generally did both, plus abused people’s personal data by selling it to postal spammers. (While dead media may not be a great example, that’s not the reason it died.) You can charge me a subscription or you can advertise to me, you can’t do both! Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. That’s why I’ve never had a subscription for Sky. Pkease tell that to satellite and cable TV providers, because they’ve always done both. They haven’t. I had cable TV (via older relatives) in the 1980s and 1990s, and don’t recall the provider advertising except on the TV guide channel (and maybe the bills, and radio and TV stations). The main ads anyone saw were from the broadcast channels that the cable provider was being paid to relay. What were they gonna do, black those out? Eventually, cable-only networks did appear, some of which had advertising. That sucked, but, again, it was done by the channel providers, not the cable providers. A lot of people, by the way, have been telling satellite and cable TV providers to take a hike. Techdirt’s written about “cord-cutting” many times—but, at this point, I think it’s kind of done, and subscriber counts are going down more due to death than cancellation per se. (If you haven’t watched live television in a while, you may not have noticed that the ads have become targeted to old people—hearing aids, motor-reclining chairs, etc.) If you pay for YouTube Premium you don’t see ANY ads Maybe not on YouTube, but are they still collecting viewing data and using it for ad targeting elsewhere? Fuck Hulu. – 🇨🇦 “Our commitment is to improving ad experiences Translation: “Our commitment is to ramp up our spying and data mining even more, so as to present viewers with advertisements for items, for example, that they’ve talked about in the presence of an Amazon Echo” Every thing you want to watch on it costs extra. What are you even paying for? What are you even paying for? Generally, people are buying it for the free and faster shipping. Sure, Amazon touts other benefits such as video, but it’s best for them if people don’t use any of that. Preferably not even the shipping benefits (there are ways to get them for free without Prime, and if a subscriber falls into such patterns by accident, their Prime subscription is just free revenue for Amazon). Last I checked uBlock Origin worked on Prime Video ads, but it’s been a little while since I watched Prime Video. In biology, unchecked constant growth is known as cancer. And if capitalism is not brought under control, it will go on to drive humanity right to extinction. I wouldn’t mind the commercials if they were more relevant to my interests. Yes, I know people find relevant ads to be creepy and intrusive, but my point is that Amazon already collects so much data about my shopping habits that I shouldn’t see the same drug ads that I see on regular TV. I stopped watching CBS This Morning because it became drug ads interrupted by a news segment. If I were advertisers, I’d be more picky about the data that the streaming services provide. Do people interact with the ads, such as scanning the QR code, or ignoring it? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? Or is the bottom line that it’s cheaper for companies to run ads on Amazon than on CBS? I don’t know what’s cheaper, but I think the bottom line is that advertising companies are able to convince their clients that, whatever it is that the ad company is doing, it’s working. I mean, their business is basically to sell people stuff they don’t need; that doesn’t just apply to the ad viewers. Or if they weren’t the same damn 2 commercials over and over again? Streaming was only ever of value when it was more convenient than piracy. That is no longer the case. It is worse. I paid for ad free, but it has suddenly gone away. Bye Amazon i got’s me one of them raspberry pi’s. it’s nicely loaded with ad blockers! so the likes of prime and you tube can fuck right off! 100% add free! well almost….some video’s have sponsored ads presented by the channel host/ maker. but that can be skipped through. YouTube Premium has rapidly increased in cost over the few couple of years. All the content is freely produced by content creators – nothing is paid for directly upfront any more as far as I know. The content creators are constantly complaining about the lack of revenue. Alphabet keeps promising “improvements” for the increasing price. But as a user I struggle to think of a single improvement, let alone one that benefits me. There are heaps of features I’d love to see but there is no process for users to offer feedback, the only feedback is from content creators and advertisers. If the price increases don’t benefit me or the content creators , that leave one last beneficiary of the price hikes… Over the years I have successfully “voted with my wallet” away from so many services but YouTube really feels like a monopoly – I paid for Pandora for a year but its just too small and found myself just going back to YT. I think only an antitrust action can save the users from Alphabets unbridled greed. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Have a Techdirt Account? Sign in now.

Title: The Computer-Science Bubble Is Bursting

Artificial intelligence is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. The job of the future might already be past its prime. For years, young people seeking a lucrative career were urged to go all in on computer science. From 2005 to 2023, the number of comp-sci majors in the United States quadrupled. All of which makes the latest batch of numbers so startling. This year, enrollment grew by only 0.2 percent nationally, and at many programs, it appears to already be in decline, according to interviews with professors and department chairs. At Stanford, widely considered one of the country’s top programs, the number of comp-sci majors has stalled after years of blistering growth. Szymon Rusinkiewicz, the chair of Princeton’s computer-science department, told me that, if current trends hold, the cohort of graduating comp-sci majors at Princeton is set to be 25 percent smaller in two years than it is today. The number of Duke students enrolled in introductory computer-science courses has dropped about 20 percent over the past year. But if the decline is surprising, the reason for it is fairly straightforward: Young people are responding to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. In recent years, the tech industry has been roiled by layoffs and hiring freezes. The leading culprit for the slowdown is technology itself. Artificial intelligence has proved to be even more valuable as a writer of computer code than as a writer of words. This means it is ideally suited to replacing the very type of person who built it. A recent Pew study found that Americans think software engineers will be most affected by generative AI. Many young people aren’t waiting to find out whether that’s true. “It’s so counterintuitive,” Molly Kinder, a Brookings Institution fellow who studies AI’s effect on the economy, told me. “This was supposed to be the job of the future. The way to stay ahead of technology was to go to college and get coding skills.” But the days of “Learn to code” might be coming to an end. If the numbers are any indication, we might have passed peak computer science. Chris Gropp, a doctoral student at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, has spent eight months searching for a job. He triple-majored in computer science, math, and computational science at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and has completed the coursework for a computer-science Ph.D. He would prefer to work instead of finishing his degree, but he has found it almost impossible to secure a job. He knows of only two people who recently pulled it off. One sent personalized cover letters for 40 different roles and set up meetings with people at the companies. The other submitted 600 applications. “We’re in an AI revolution, and I am a specialist in the kind of AI that we’re doing the revolution with, and I can’t find anything,” Gropp told me. “I found myself a month or two ago considering, Do I just take a break from this thing that I’ve been training for for most of my life and go be an apprentice electrician?” Gropp is contending with a weak job market for recent college graduates in general and the tech sector in particular. Although employment for 22-to-27-year-olds in other fields has grown slightly over the past three years, employment for computer-science and math jobs in that age group has fallen by 8 percent. Not long ago, graduates from top comp-sci programs—such as those at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon—would have been fending off recruiters from Google and Amazon. Now, professors at those schools told me, their graduates are having to try much harder to find work. Gropp’s dad, William Gropp, runs the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “I can say, as the father of a computer-science master’s degree holder with expertise in machine learning who is still looking for a job, that the industry is not what it used to be,” he told me. In the ultimate irony, candidates like Gropp might be unable to get jobs working on AI because AI itself is taking the jobs. “We know AI is affecting jobs,” Rusinkiewicz, from Princeton, told me. “It’s making people more efficient at some or many aspects of their jobs, and therefore, perhaps companies feel they can get away with doing a bit less hiring.” Derek Thompson: Something alarming is happening to the job market The best evidence that artificial intelligence is displacing tech workers comes from the fact that the industry that has most thoroughly integrated AI is the one with such unusually high unemployment. Tech leaders have said publicly that they no longer need as many entry-level coders. Executives at Alphabet and Microsoft have said that AI writes or assists with writing upwards of 25 percent of their code. (Microsoft recently laid off 6,000 workers.) Anthropic’s chief product officer recently told The New York Times that senior engineers are giving work to the company’s chatbot instead of a low-level human employee. The company’s CEO has warned that AI could replace half of all entry-level workers in the next five years. Kinder, the Brookings fellow, said she worries that companies soon will simply eliminate the entire bottom rung of the career ladder. The plight of the tech grads, she told me, could be a warning for all entry-level white-collar workers. Not everyone agrees that AI is causing the turbulence in the job market. The tech industry frequently goes through booms and busts. The biggest companies exploded in size when the economy was good. Now, with high interest rates and the specter of new tariffs, executives are likely holding off on expanding, and workers are reluctant to leave their job, says Zack Mabel, director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Companies have an incentive to blame layoffs on AI instead of forces within their control, David Deming, an economics professor at Harvard, told me. “Before we see big changes from AI in the labor market, companies have to internalize this new capability and change what they ask for. And that’s the thing that I have not seen very much of,” he said. “It could be AI, but we just don’t know.” Enrollment in the computer-science major has historically fluctuated with the job market. When jobs are scarce, people choose to study something else. Eventually, there aren’t enough computer-science graduates, salaries go up, and more people are drawn in. Prior declines have always rebounded to enrollment levels higher than where they started. (And some universities, such as the University of Chicago, still haven’t seen any enrollment drops.) Sam Madden, a computer-science professor at MIT, told me that even if companies are employing generative AI, that will likely create more demand for software engineers, not less. Read: Silicon Valley braces for chaos Whether the past few years augur a temporary lull or an abrupt reordering of working life, economists suggest the same response for college students: Major in a subject that offers enduring, transferable skills. Believe it or not, that could be the liberal arts. Deming’s research shows that male history and social-science majors end up out-earning their engineering and comp-sci counterparts in the long term, as they develop the soft skills that employers consistently seek out. “It’s actually quite risky to go to school to learn a trade or a particular skill, because you don’t know what the future holds,” Deming told me. “You need to try to think about acquiring a skill set that’s going to be future-proof and last you for 45 years of working life.” Of course, when faced with enormous uncertainty, many young people take the opposite approach and pursue something with a sure path to immediate employment. The question of the day is how many of those paths AI will soon foreclose.

Title: CEOs Using AI to Terrorize Their Employees
URL: https://futurism.com/ceo-ai-scare-labor
Time Published: 2025-06-20T17:09:36Z
Full Content:
As artificial intelligence becomes the corporate buzzword du jour, executives are finding more and more ways to shoehorn the trendy tech into their everyday business operations. That has a lot of workers anxious about automation, income inequality, and increased workloads — something c-suite bigwigs are all too happy to take advantage of. Though AI — really just a fun name for large language models (LLMs), or predictive chatbots — in its current state isn't likely to bring a labor revolution anytime soon, CEOs find that the threat of AI automation works just as well. As Axios highlighted this week, CEOs are increasingly using AI adoption as a cudgel to justify layoffs, or to manufacture consent for layoffs in the future. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, recently said AI is likely to "reduce our total corporate workforce," while JPMorgan executives told investors that AI will allow for a "10 percent headcount reduction." Others, like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, are threatening workers directly, saying that AI is now the "baseline expectation." Per Axios, Shopify managers hiring human workers now have to explain to top brass why AI wouldn't be a better choice for any given job. This kind of doomsday messaging goes hand in hand with increased expectations for workers' productivity. A recent survey found that 77 percent of workers reported that AI adds to their workload. Of that, a staggering proportion — 39 percent — involves fixing the buggy tech's sloppy mistakes. While AI is a pretty recent phenomenon, these kinds of scare tactics aren't new. "Disciplining labor" is a concept that occasionally gets thrown around discussions of supply side economics. It's a term used to describe broad economic measures that keep workers in line, in order to keep corporate profits high — suppressing unions, keeping wage growth low, and dangling the threat of unemployment over their heads. In this sense, AI in its current form is simply a new whip for CEOs to use on their employees. It's having what Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, calls an "inculcation effect" on workers. It's a "warning with an anticipatory alert that preempts later trauma going viral," he told Axios. Plus, now that the job market has been devastated by AI spambots, finding a new gig is harder than ever. With AI, workers are forced onto their back foot as their corporate overlords demand more productivity for less pay. If the choice is to either work harder or clear out their desk, employees are then less likely to ask for quality of life improvements, or to organize for unions that could win them. And that, of course, means corporate honchos get an even bigger piece of the pie.

Title: Andy Jassy says AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce but at least he’s honest about it

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the quiet part out loud this week, predicting AI will reduce its workforce. At least he’s honest about it, even if he trotted out the “free up workers for higher-value work” cliche. Microsoft is reportedly laying off 3% of its staff too, no doubt for partly the same reason. Can Mark Zuckerberg vault Meta into the top tier of AI providers via acquihire? He sure seems to be trying. Meantime, Google kept up its recent stream of new models coming with an entry-level edition, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite. Continuing a recent series of Silicon Valley tech companies chasing the opportunity in government technology, OpenAI won a hefty defense contract. Speaking of big money in AI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab reportedly raised $2 billion on a $10 billion valuation. And in late-breaking news, Apple reportedly has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity. Two enterprise tech stalwarts attempted to position themselves to take advantage of customers’ focus on AI and data and the evolving mix of public and private cloud services needed for that. For one, Broadcom announced the general availability of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the latest iteration of its private cloud platform. Pure Storage also introduced its Enterprise Data Cloud, a rethink of enterprise storage aimed at recasting itself not just as a storage vendor but as a platform for autonomous data operations. At its re:Inforce conference this week, Amazon Web Services issued a raft of new features all aimed at making cybersecurity simpler, led by a preview release of a new version of AWS Security Hub. Texas Instruments joined the pack of chipmakers promising to build much more domestic factory capacity, saying it will invest $60 billion in U.S. fabs, though the time frame is not clear. Meanwhile, the Intel shakeup continued with several new executives … and several thousand fewer factory workers. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Must-read for anyone wondering what’s next for data and data platforms: Ali Ghodsi’s data intelligence playbook: Turning data into agentic advantage The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims joins others on cautioning against assuming AGI is around the corner: Why superintelligent AI isn’t taking over anytime soon Maybe a good thing given the dangers even OpenAI admits: OpenAI exec warns of growing risk that AI could aid in biological weapons development Moreover, it appears that ChatGPT isn’t so great for learning, at least initially: Study finds that LLM use leads to ‘likely decrease’ in learning skills Meanwhile, on the job front: Andy Jassy says generative AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years He even used the canonical argument that these agents will free up human staff to take on more creative roles. But since Jassy is saying Amazon will have fewer employees as a result of AI, it appears that some will have to find those creative roles somewhere else. Of course, AI, like many new technologies, will also create new jobs, but it’s not yet clear how many. Amazon partner Anthropic predicts even more sweeping layoffs coming. Agentic AI is the disruption du jour at this year’s TM Forum DTW Ignite conference Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab valued at $10B after $2B fundraising (per Financial Times) Google updates Gemini 2.5 LLM series with new entry-level model, pricing changes Midjourney debuts new V1 video generation model Domino Data Lab introduces new AI governance, data management features Nurix AI launches enterprise-grade human-like voice AI agents with NuPlay Vehicle intelligence startup Applied Intuition raises $600M at $15B valuation OpenAI bags $200M Pentagon contract to explore defense industry AI applications Healthcare technology startup Commure raises $200M ahead of IPO AI startup Tennr raises $101M to revolutionize patient referrals Clay reportedly raises new funding led by CapitalG on a $3B valuation Maven AGI, which aims to unify the full “customer journey,” raised $50M in Series B funding Traversal launches with $48M to tackle site reliability and observability with AI Wildfire detection startup Pano AI raises $44M (per WSJ) Browserbase reels in $40M for its browser automation tools Sedai raises $20M to optimize cloud environments with AI agents Tadaweb raises $20M to scale open-source intelligence platform enhanced with AI Extend gets $17M in funding to boost the speed and accuracy of document processing with AI models Diskover gets $7.5M from Snowflake, NetApp and others to facilitate unstructured data discovery for AI Startup Typedef gets $5.5M seed funding to build customized data pipelines for AI model workloads There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Broadcom says VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 recognizes the ascendancy of private cloud And our analysis: VCF 9 goes live: Recapping the execution roadmap for Broadcom’s AI and cloud infrastructure vision Pure Storage launches unified data management cloud and new flash arrays AWS to introduce updated server CPU, new AI training chip Vibe coding, platform power and the new face of AppDev – theCUBE Research analysis Mixpanel expands analytics platform with metric trees, AI insights and experimentation tools Trend Micro debuts data center appliances with built-in cybersecurity software Key takeaways from Cisco Live 2025 Texas Instruments to invest $60B+ in US fab network Amazon to invest nearly $13B in data centers in Australia Coralogix gets $115M in funding to pioneer agentic AI-powered observability Defense technology startup Mach Industries raises $100M PostHog raises $70M to simplify software development projects Clinical AI startup Nabla to focus on agentic automation after raising $70M in funding With $27M in funding, Fleet wants to bring more freedom to enterprise device management Onebrief, a platform for operational planning and military staff workflows, reaches $1.1B valuation with $20M Series C extension, nearly doubling in 3 months Tensec to deliver real-time, cross-border payments to smaller businesses after raising $10M in funding We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Security researchers find 16B stolen credentials from malware in open cloud storage UBS confirms employee data leak after ransomware attack on supplier INKY warns of new QR code phishing tactic using embedded JavaScript AWS focuses on simplifying cloud security at re:Inforce 2025 conference CrowdStrike launches Falcon for AWS Security Incident Response at re:Inforce 2025 Operant AI expands Gatekeeper platform with MCP Gateway for AI runtime security New Commvault and Kyndryl partnership focuses on hybrid cloud recovery and regulatory compliance Apiiro report reveals industry differences are shaping generative AI risk profiles Kusari debuts AI-powered pull request security tool for software supply chain protection Cyolo updates privileged access platform with tools to monitor unmanaged vendor connections Dashlane adds AI phishing alerts to Omnix platform to bolster credential protection Base44 joins Wix in $80M deal to support natural language software development Bitdefender to acquire Mesh Security to bolster email protection for managed service providers Neovera acquires Greenway Solutions to expand fraud testing capabilities More cybersecurity news here Waymo’s robotaxis will soon hit the streets of New York City Trump will push TikTok deadline another 90 days SpaceX competitor Eutelsat raising €1.35B in new funding And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Amar Subramanya, head of engineering for Google’s Gemini chatbot, is leaving the company, employees were told in a reorganization announced last week.

Title: Top takeaways from BI's conversations with real-estate investors
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-tips-how-to-start-investing-property-homeowner-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-20T13:16:34Z

Happy Friday! It's not goodbye. It's see you later. I start the second half of my paternity leave next week. I'll be out for the summer, but you're in good hands with my UK colleague Hallam Bullock. Just try not to give him too much grief on July 4. In today's big story, some advice for people looking to get their real-estate empire off the ground. What's on deck Markets: Why understanding Goldman Sachs' "coffee culture" is so important for interns. Tech: How Gen Z is getting around the brutal market for entry-level jobs in the tech industry. Business: It turns out that Target's loss is Walmart's gain when it comes to wealthier customers. But first, location, location, location. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. On the path to financial freedom, real-estate investing is typically a key stop. The stock market or e-commerce side hustles can be popular options, but collecting investment properties is often viewed as the Holy Grail of setting yourself up financially. But real-estate investing doesn't come easy … or cheap. There's also plenty of risk when taking on so much debt. Lucky for you, BI's Kathleen Elkins has written extensively about people who have set up real-estate empires. That includes a couple who built a portfolio of over 100 units and now work part time and travel half the year. It might sound a world away from someone just starting out, but it didn't happen overnight. When they started scooping up investment properties, Letizia Alto and Kenji Asakura didn't even own a primary residence. They shared six main pieces of advice they always follow when trying to make money in real estate. Here are some more takeaways from Kathleen's conversations with real-estate investors: It's not just for people with deep pockets: High upfront costs (down payment, closing costs, potential renovations) can be a big deterrent for hopeful real-estate investors. But a little can sometimes go a long way. A former firefighter went from earning $1,600 a month to owning over 30 properties. He spoke to Kathleen about how he got creative to land a $3 million deal with just $30,000 in savings. Do your homework: Real estate's biggest challenge can be figuring out where you want to buy something. A 32-year-old who retired early thanks to his real-estate investments shared the two software tools he swears by to find markets to buy in and price rentals appropriately. Another investor said this business book helped shape his investing strategy. The beauty of being stuck in the middle: When you think of real estate, you might immediately gravitate to vacation-style properties or long-term rentals. However, some investors see the most value in mid-term rentals. Don't forget about taxes: Generating income from multiple properties complicates how you file your taxes. But as the aforementioned Asakura put it to Kathleen, "The tax code is essentially a series of incentives to encourage certain behavior that the government wants." Here's how they get the most out of their investments from a tax perspective. 1. An intern's guide to succeeding on Wall Street. If you're one of the lucky interns in Goldman Sachs' summer class, take full advantage of the company's coffee culture to build connections. And if you're over at Blackstone, CEO Steve Schwarzman thinks you should embrace the change. 2. Citi gets an AI level-up. The bank's trio of AI strategy leaders gave an inkling of what's to come in a memo seen by BI. It's scaling AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with its tools. Read more about the strategy. 3. Don't overpay for your Aperol spritzes this summer. The value of the US dollar has dropped amid trade war and deficit concerns. That means unfavorable exchange rates and transaction fees can jack up costs when traveling abroad. Here are some ways to avoid excess charges overseas. 1. Is AI rejecting your job application? As companies turn to AI to boost productivity, BI has spoken to many frustrated job seekers who wonder if humans are even reviewing their applications. BI reached out to seven companies, from Kraft Heinz to Google, to find out what role AI plays in their hiring process. Spoiler: their answers varied. 2. Harvey and LexisNexis hard-launched. AI legal-tech darling Harvey is partnering with LexisNexis to let users access the vast legal database within Harvey's app. The move strengthens Harvey's claim as the go-to legal software provider as its rivals make gains. 3. How young techies cope with the industry's hiring downturn. Gen Z is staying optimistic about tech jobs, though many have had to lower their expectations and take what they can get. Layoffs, getting ghosted by potential employers, and dealing with the threat of AI are just part of the process. 1. Wait, is Walmart cool now? Clothing sales are up 23% at the retail giant this year, and shoppers are sharing "haul" videos online, impressed by its surprisingly trendy finds. BI's Katie Notopoulos found Walmart is attracting wealthier customers overall and picking up some Target defectors. 2. Efficiency secrets of the Wall Street elite. Leaders in the hot, high-growth secondaries industry are busier than ever. Fourteen industry power players told BI their top efficiency tips, from fake calendar blocks to just saying "no." 3. Peyton Manning goes from signal caller to shot-caller. Manning's Omaha Productions is looking to move its content off the field. He recently spoke with BI about his production company's success and said there's no one-size-fits-all definition of an Omaha show. Not every pro athlete reaches Manning's roaring financial success, though. Kroger reports earnings. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Jump to

Title: The tech job market is rough for entry-level workers right now. Here's how Gen Z is dodging the downtrend.

Time Published: 2025-06-20T09:00:02Z

Recent years of rolling layoffs in tech have some Gen Z tech workers stressed — but not deterred. "I feel like everyone feels a bit stressed that there are layoffs," said Merc Heredia-Ferran, a 26-year-old brand marketer at Google who joined the company last year. "I get sent articles that Google laid off people that I didn't even know about, like I'm reading that in the news." The job market has hit Gen Z hard. While older millennials faced higher unemployment rates following the Great Recession compared to Gen Z now, Gen Z experiences unique challenges such as increased Big Tech cost-cutting and AI upending the workplace. BI spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z tech workers and job seekers about their experiences as they hustle to start their careers and as artificial intelligence and changing corporate and immigration policies transform early-career workers' introduction to the workplace. A SignalFire report found that entry-level hiring in Big Tech is down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels; at startups, it's down more than 30%. The percentage of graduates from top computer science programs employed at Big Tech companies has halved since 2022, the report found. As tech companies pull back hiring across the industry, it's become a tighter job market for Gen Z. The New York Fed reported that unemployment for recent college graduates who majored in computer science was 6.1%, compared to 5.8% for recent college graduates overall. Layoff concerns also weigh heavily in the tech field. Over 28% of job seekers age 18 to 24 and over 21% of those age 25 to 34 say they were laid off in their last job, a ZipRecruiter survey from the first quarter of this year found. Tech still remains a popular career choice for Gen Z in part because of its schedule flexibility, which is prioritized by 90% of graduates, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter. Tech jobs often pay more compared to many other careers. "Agencies, you can be cut at any time," Heredia-Ferran said. "You don't even see it coming. Here I feel like, with the high salary, if it happens, I have a cushion now, and the Google name, I can maybe land something if it happens." A software engineer at Amazon says he "got lucky" in landing his full-time job at Amazon. When the 26-year-old India native interned at the e-commerce giant in 2023, the timing was anything but ideal: Their offer coincided with a hiring freeze. "After September 2022, Amazon just stopped hiring interns for that year," the engineer told BI. They completed their internship and received an "inclined to hire" evaluation in August 2023. Due to the freeze, they didn't start their full-time role until June 2024. Compared to the thousands of laid-off employees across tech and at Amazon, among them, peers still looking for work, they're grateful. "I can't give much advice to someone who is looking for a job. I myself can't crack exactly how I landed the job. I just got lucky in that," the engineer said. Expectations don't always match reality. Nearly 40% of rising graduates believe an internship will help them land a job, yet 9% of recent grads said their internships helped them do that, ZipRecruiter found in a 2025 survey of 3,000 recent and rising undergraduate students ZipRecruiter found that rising graduates believe they'll earn a salary of $101,500; recent grads earned an average of $68,400. "The expectation versus reality gap is quite high," said DeMase. If young workers do get the tech job they seek, a complicating factor is the growth of AI. A Hult International Business School survey found 37% of HR leaders say they'd rather use AI than hire a recent graduate. Young workers say AI has helped them and left them feeling uncertain. "In terms of work, it's gotten to a very interesting place because a lot of things that used to take me a day to do, I can now do them in one hour, but that hasn't translated into my work decreasing. It's just more work," the Amazon engineer said. "I don't know if we'll reach the point when AI is doing everything I'm doing and finally replace me," they continued with a nervous laugh. Upon graduation in 2022, Jonathan, a now 26-year-old software engineer, set about applying for tech jobs. He applied to about 300 roles and received 12 responses, some of which were coding tests, before finally landing a full-time job after three months. Nine months later, he was laid off when his tech company closed the office where he was based, meaning he was once again on the job hunt. This time, he applied to about 600 roles, and he heard back from five. "I was talking with some other former classmates and people graduating in the same year," said Jonathan, who asked to withhold his last name due to company policies on speaking with the press. "Most of us were in the same boat. We just graduated, never found anything, and had just gotten laid off from another position. We were all weighing our options. Should we go back and get our master's? It didn't seem like anyone was hiring early-level positions." Tyler Creach, a 26-year-old senior business development manager at software company Freshworks, also said she found the job market difficult before landing her role, which took about four to five months. The tech industry can be "hard to predict" for young people, and it's tough to "see yourself in it for a long time, she said. "Young people are struggling to find stable, relatively well-paying jobs," Creach said. "That's creating a lot of resentment or frustration, possibly from young people. Instead of getting a start right away, they're punting it down the line." The ZipRecruiter survey found that over half of tech job seekers age 25 to 34 and nearly 44% of those age 18 to 24 say they received zero job offers in the past month. ZipRecruiter found that a majority of job seekers in these age demographics say they've been ghosted by an employer during their job search, an experience that has become more common for Gen Z. Over 30% of them say their job search is going "poor" and over half say it's just going "fair." Creach found she had to compromise her job expectations, particularly in location. She previously had all-remote roles and ended up taking a job that required going to an office. She hopes to eventually do something more creative in her career or move into management. "Now it is super difficult to get a job for those remote roles," Creach said. "I had to think about how I could start getting more interviews. Once I started looking at more jobs based in my area, whether hybrid or fully in-office, I started to get more responses and make more progress." Jonathan landed his current job after three to four months. It did require moving states, and he now works in defense tech and not his preferred industry, video games. He says he's trying to get any experience he can. "My dad said when he graduated, it was difficult for him to find a job," Jonathan said. "In the early 90s, there was a mini-recession. To some degree, it has gotten harder over the years to land anything. Everyone tells you to get into computer science. That's where all the money is at, that's where the jobs are at. It's a lot harder than they make it out to be." Despite the job market slowdown, many Gen Z tech workers are still optimistic about working in tech. Justin Dobey, 27, pursued a master's degree in 2020 as the COVID pandemic began. After graduation, his job search just took about a month since there's a "deep lack of electrical engineers" where he lives in South Carolina. He works in a federal government engineering job that has rolled back hiring, though he hasn't been affected by cuts. Dobey said his friends with non-engineering degrees are struggling more to find work than his peers in engineering. "We might not all be in our dream jobs, but they are doing all right, last time I checked." Dobey said he's optimistic about the future of STEM jobs. "If you want to live comfortably and not want to work your whole life like, be a doctor or lawyer, get a STEM degree in computer systems, cybersecurity, AI," he said. DeMase, the ZipRecruiter career expert, said it's important for tech job seekers to learn more about AI and use it ethically. She also advises using their network, getting to know more people in the industry, and tailoring résumés to better align with target roles, which can even include skills from volunteering or part-time work "When folks think about the roles they'll apply for, it's important to lean into their strengths and target roles that are hyperaligned with their superpowers," DeMase said. She also said it's important to speak clearly about the impact they've made in their work or in their projects. "Gen Z approaches the interview as an interrogation rather than a conversation," DeMase said. "It's a conversation, not an interrogation. Come prepared to have an organic chat. Don't be afraid to remember you're interviewing as well." Jump to

Title: Do The Woo Community: The Value of Starting Over in the Tech Industry

Posted by Bob Dunn There’s a myth in the tech industry that success is a straight line: get the degree, land the job, climb the ladder, maybe start a startup, and everything falls into place. But as shared by Mendel Kurland on an episode of the series DevPulse: Expanding the Stack,” the truth is anything but linear. Mendel’s story starts with a refreshingly humble admission. He failed out of college, earning what he calls a “0.52 GPA.” Instead of this being the end, it marked an unconventional new beginning. Mendel launched his first startup while scraping by, sleeping in his car with his cats, and building websites for local businesses. The drive to bounce back, hustle through uncertainty, and learn along the way became his greatest assets. Thanks to our sponsor Woo: As a shop owner or site builder, whether you’re just starting or scaling up, WooCommerce makes it simple to build and grow an online store, your way. The podcast episode revisits Mendel’s journey through major players like GoDaddy, Amazon, and DigitalOcean. But what stands out is his advice for anyone feeling stuck: “People unfortunately need resilience right now. They need hustle, and they need to reinvent themselves.” In today’s climate of restructuring and layoffs, Mendel stresses that the key to thriving is not to cling to past successes, but to be willing to try something new, even if it means starting from scratch. Mendel and the hosts emphasize an often-overlooked skill in tech: self-awareness. Whether shifting from coding to consulting, product management to community building, or even just taking a new route to an old job, regularly stepping outside routine and asking, “Does this still fit who I am?” is what separates those who thrive from those who stagnate. For Mendel, reinvention isn’t just about career pivots. It’s about re-examining what brings you fulfillment and finding ways to be useful sometimes in roles you’d never anticipated. As tech rapidly evolves, he advocates exploring adjacent paths, embracing discomfort, and connecting with community. “Progress is always forward and progress is always new,” Mendel says. The people who succeed aren’t guaranteed a path, they’re just better at finding the next one. The episode is a candid conversation about the realities of tech careers, but it’s just as much a call to action for anyone in the WordPress, WooCommerce, or broader tech ecosystem. Reinvention and resilience aren’t reserved for the rare. There are common skills we can all practice: active listening, self-analysis, and genuine curiosity. So, for anyone feeling uncertain about what’s next, remember Mendel’s story: sometimes the best way forward is to pause, reflect, and have the courage to build the future you want, even if it means starting over.
