Title: Amazon has lots of software bugs with Kindle Updates

The latest Amazon Kindle software update, which includes all the new accessibility features, has been a resounding success. However, there are always a few bugs that need to be addressed. The 15.8.4 update causes the screen to flicker constantly, but this issue can be resolved with a reboot. Multiple popups appear, blank and without any text. Sideloaded books had invalid ASIN numbers, but this issue has been resolved with a new Calibre update issued on September 5th. The update also has errors with borrowing e-books from the Kindle Unlimited program. Many of the books that users want to download are not downloading properly. The only way to fix this issue is to factory reset the Kindle, which will obviously delete all your content, including sideloaded books. Obviously, users should not have to go to these great lengths to use their Kindle as they normally would. Software updates have been causing more problems for the past couple of years, causing more problems than they solve. This started in 2022 when Amazon switched its programming language from JavaScript to React Native. This happened right after the new home screen experience was rolled out. Instead of your library being on the home screen, it now features page after page of recommendations and Amazon trying to sell you more Kindle Books. Firmware updates have been steadily deteriorating after the programming change. Still, they reached a breaking point every year since Amazon conducted layoffs of Kindle executives, engineers, programmers, and the book recommendations team. Hundreds of people left during those years, and dozens more did so due to the increased workload, but their pay remained the same. A few people in the Kindle division told me last month that morale is at an all-time low and Amazon simply doesn’t really care about Fire Tablets, Kindles, and Fire TV boxes anymore.

Title: Perfect Competition Will Crush AI Profits
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/perfect-competition-will-crush-ai-profits/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T14:30:01Z
Full Content:
By Dan Amoss PostedSeptember 6, 2025 Today’s AI investment craze suffers from the same flawed assumptions that sparked past bubbles. Without a course correction, the U.S. economy faces a self-inflicted bust. In the mid-2000s, Wall Street’s best and brightest were packaging subprime loans into complex securities and assuring the world they were safe. Regulators nodded. Rating agencies blessed them. Investors snapped them up. Few asked the obvious question: What if the assumptions behind these instruments are wrong? Today, a similar blind spot is spreading through the economy – not through mortgages, but through artificial intelligence (AI). Everyone from Big Tech giants to startup founders, institutional investors, and Washington policymakers is convinced that artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, and that big capital expenditures (capex) today will lead to countless industrywide profits in the future. But there’s a problem: Demand in value-added, real-world applications is unlikely to be large enough to justify all this investment. The demand that AI promoters constantly highlight is drawn from Large language model (LLM) training sessions and queries – neither of which is associated with much sustainable, real-world revenue. Much of the revenue being booked in this ecosystem ultimately comes from a limited pool of venture capital (VC) funds. A recent story from The Information estimated that these LLM companies generate roughly $18.5 billion in annualized revenue. Ironically, The Information was trying to rebut the claims from an MIT Media Lab report that concluded 95% of businesses are seeing no return on AI pilot projects. It’s ironic because $18.5 billion in annualized revenue is peanuts relative to the astonishingly large amount of capital poured into these companies. The revenue streams in the chart above are also not very valuable because LLM companies are not showing positive operating leverage. Plenty of evidence indicates that costs scale alongside revenue at LLM companies. Heavy users burn lots of electricity and shorten Nvidia chips’ lives in their usage of the models. And free users will just switch to a competing LLM if ever required to pay a subscription fee. Today’s AI investment mania has two key blind spots: the fallacy of composition and adverse selection. Let’s break those down. The fallacy of composition is the mistaken belief that what’s true for one player is true for all. If one company like Microsoft makes money selling AI products, then investors assume the entire AI sector will do the same. But that’s not how competitive markets work. In fact, success in a competitive market often comes at the expense of rivals. There can be winners, but not everyone can win. This fallacy infected the telecom boom of the late 1990s. Just because one broadband provider had profitable demand didn’t mean every fiber-optic network was worth building. Billions were spent laying cables that no one would use for another decade. Then there’s adverse selection. In insurance, this happens when sick people are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people, leading to losses for the insurer that doesn’t attract enough healthy customers. In AI, something similar is unfolding: the heaviest users of AI chatbots and tools – those demanding the most computing resources – are often not paying enough in subscription fees to cover their costs to the LLM provider. The casual users, who make up the vast majority, may never convert to paying customers. This undermines the very business model these companies are betting on. What happens when the market discovers this? You get a doom loop: companies overspend on infrastructure, hoping for future demand that never materializes, while investors keep piling in – until someone finally notices the emperor is minimally clothed. There’s a popular narrative that the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) will capture most of the economic value created by AI. But history suggests otherwise. In past tech revolutions, the biggest winners weren’t always the biggest companies. The advent of the internet helped millions of small and mid-sized businesses gain customers and compete globally. Low-cost e-commerce tools like Shopify and advertising platforms like Google and Facebook gave them the reach they never had before. Similarly, it’s possible that AI’s biggest beneficiaries won’t be the firms building the models, but the dentists, restaurant owners, and local manufacturers who use those tools to accelerate mundane processes and serve customers better. The irony? While these SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) benefit, the AI platforms enabling them may struggle to get paid. If Google’s new Veo video model helps a dentist craft a great local ad, will that dentist pay Google more? One of the most dangerous assumptions in AI capex is that these platforms will enjoy pricing power – meaning they can charge enough to cover their costs and then some. But look closely, and this assumption crumbles. The AI chatbot market looks a lot like perfect competition, a textbook term for markets where many providers offer nearly identical products, and prices fall toward the cost of production. Unlike the broadband boom of the 2000s, where companies had to rip up streets to lay wires and customers had few broadband alternatives, switching from one AI model to another takes a few clicks. If you’re a free user of ChatGPT, and it suddenly costs $20 a month to use it at all, but Claude or Gemini is free and just as good, nothing is stopping you from switching. That’s the nightmare scenario for the AI providers: they’ve built massive infrastructure assuming recurring subscription revenue, but the customer base may have no loyalty and little willingness to pay. It’s like investing billions into oil wells only to find out your oil sells for $10 a barrel instead of $70. In a healthy economy, production and consumption communicate constantly. If a company builds something useful, customers respond by buying it. If they overbuild, inventories pile up and prices fall, sending a signal to slow down. AI infrastructure, by contrast, is being built largely on faith. Companies are scaling up compute power without clear signs of sustainable demand. Unlike oil and gas, where prices adjust second-by-second, AI companies operate in a fog. They release tools, collect usage stats, and hope that paid conversions will follow. But hope is not a business model. In fact, today’s AI leaders resemble 2006-era banks more than healthy, feedback-driven enterprises. They’re in an unhealthy relationship with venture capital (VC) firms that need higher and higher valuation “marks” to justify their fees. VC firms don’t want transparency about customer conversion rates, churn, or operating losses that scale with revenue. That would kill the narrative before the VCs can cash out in IPOs to the public market. Meanwhile, China is asking a much more grounded question: How can we use AI to make real-world industries more efficient? Companies like DeepSeek are building AI tools designed to solve narrow problems in energy, logistics, and manufacturing. That’s closer to how the human brain works – selectively activating regions based on the task at hand. And it’s proving to be more effective than trying to create superintelligence in a box. While U.S. Big Tech chases lofty visions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – often undefined and possibly unachievable – China is deploying AI in practical ways that produce results. To compete, the U.S. must start asking more rigorous questions: What is AI actually for? Who pays for it? And how does it improve the lives of average Americans? If there’s one place where AI hype is meeting hard reality, it’s software engineering. Veteran developer Carl Brown, in an interview with Ed Zitron, shredded the idea that large language models (LLMs) will replace human coders anytime soon. He explained how writing code is only a small part of the job. The real work is long-term thinking, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the software should do. AI tools can crank out lines of code fast. But they often do it sloppily, duplicating functions and ignoring best practices. The result is software that’s harder to maintain, easier to hack, and more prone to crashing. Brown compared AI code to “vibe coding,” which is typing something into a chatbot and hoping it works. That might be fine for a one-time prototype, but it’s a recipe for disaster in a software program that’s meant to last. Worse still, managers – who assume AI is miraculous because they hear about it so much on CNBC – don’t understand programming. These managers are using AI to justify layoffs or to demand unrealistic productivity increases from their teams. This may create a generation of junior engineers who never learn to code properly because they’re relying on tools that don’t understand the long game of software development. It’s often claimed that software is the most natural market for AI to disrupt. However, Carl Brown’s view, plus dozens of other examples, confirm that in real-world stress tests, AI misses too many things, or hallucinates too often, to be considered a revolutionary technology trend. So, in the months ahead, we’re likely to see more hints that Big Tech companies are tapping the brakes on Nvidia chip orders. They’ll do this to avoid an accelerating decline in their free cash flows – a trend that’s already looking scary. For example, see this projection from BofA Global Research. It shows capital spending as a percentage of operating cash flow at the companies building hyperscale data centers. A recession or a bust in venture capital funding for AI LLM companies (like OpenAI) could drive operating cash flow lower. That would make the BofA chart surge higher than they project in the dotted lines. And higher capex relative to cash flow means free cash flow would dive toward zero. To avoid that scenario, hyperscale data center operators would cut AI chip orders. Editor’s note: Members of Strategic Intelligence Pro can access Dan’s full report, including the stock pick, here.

Ireland and Hungary go head-to-head in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier in Dublin on Saturday evening. Both sides will be searching for a positive start to their Group F campaign, in an intriguing group that also contains Portugal and Armenia. Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has named a 23-man squad for the games against Hungary and Armenia, although there are some notable absences. Captain Seamus Coleman has been left out after being an unused substitute in Everton’s opening three Premier League matches this season. The experienced defender has not featured since withdrawing from the June friendlies through injury. Gavin Bazunu and Chiedozie Ogbene return to the squad after lengthy injury layoffs. Bazunu has recovered from knee surgery to reclaim his place at Southampton, while Ogbene is back for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in October 2024. Celtic defender Liam Scales is available to play after rolling his ankle against Rangers at the weekend, while Johnny Kenny has come in as attacking cover after Troy Parrott pulled out of the squad. Nathan Collins will captain the side in Coleman’s absence, with Caoimhín Kelleher providing experience in goal after his move from Liverpool to Brentford. However, Robbie Brady, Callum O’Dowda and Festy Ebosele all miss out through injury. Read – The mind-blowing numbers behind record-breaking transfer window Hungary manager Marco Rossi has named a larger-than-usual 27-man squad, including four potential debutants. The Italian coach has emphasised selecting players in good form, with Barna Tóth, Rajmund Molnár, Dániel Lukács and Bence Ötvös all earning their first call-ups. Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai will captain the side, with the 24-year-old having been Hungary’s talisman since taking over the armband in November 2022. However, there are concerns over Hungary’s over-reliance on their skipper, with the team struggling when he is marked out of games. Milos Kerkez, Willi Orbán and András Schäfer provide experience in the squad, while striker Barnabás Varga remains a key attacking threat. Rossi has stressed the importance of starting the campaign well against a physical Irish side. Read – The biggest Champions League omissions as squad lists announced Hallgrímsson’s side have shown gradual improvement since replacing Stephen Kenny in the hot seat last year. They secured their League B status in the UEFA Nations League, defeating Bulgaria 4-2 on aggregate in a relegation playoff. Their most recent friendlies both ended in stalemates against Senegal (1-1) and Luxembourg (0-0), highlighting their struggles in front of goal. Marco Rossi’s team endured a difficult Nations League campaign, finishing bottom of Group A3. They were relegated after losing 6-1 on aggregate to Turkey in the promotion/relegation playoffs. Recent friendlies brought mixed results, with a 2-1 win over Azerbaijan and a 0-2 defeat to Sweden.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp says U.S. labor workers won’t lose their jobs to AI—‘it’s not true’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-ai-wont-replace-labor-jobs/

Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. As fears swirl that American manufacturing workers and skilled laborers may soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and robots, Alex Karp, CEO of the AI and data analytics software company Palantir Technologies, hopes to change the narrative. “It’s not true, and in fact, it’s kind of the opposite,” Karp said in an interview with Fortune Thursday at the company’s commercial customer conference, AIPCon, where Palantir customers showcased how they were using the company’s software platform and generative AI within their own businesses. The primary danger of AI in this country, says Karp, is that workers don’t understand that AI will actually help them in their roles—and it will hardly replace them. “Silicon Valley’s done an immensely crappy job of explaining that,” he said. “If you’re in manufacturing, in any capacity: You’re on the assembly line, you maintain a complicated machine—you have any kind of skilled labor job—the way we do AI will actually make your job more valuable and make you more valuable. But currently you would think—just roaming around the country, and if you listen to the AI narratives coming out of Silicon Valley—that all these people are going to lose their jobs tomorrow.” Karp made these comments the day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August jobs report, which showcased a climbing unemployment rate and stagnating hiring figures, reigniting fears of whether AI is at all responsible for the broader slowdown. There has been limited data thus far suggesting that generative AI is to blame for the slowing jobs market—or even job cuts for that matter—though a recent ADP hiring report offered a rare suggestion that AI may be one of several factors influencing hiring sentiment. Some executives, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, have cited the efficiency gains of AI for layoffs at their companies, and others, like Ford CEO Jim Farley and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, have made lofty predictions about how AI is on track to replace jobs in the future. Most of these projections have been centered around white collar roles, in particular, versus manufacturing or skilled labor positions. Karp, who has a PhD in neoclassical social theory and a reputation for being outspoken and contrarian on many issues, argues that fears of AI eliminating skilled labor jobs are unfounded—and he’s committed to “correcting” the public perception. Earlier this week, Palantir launched “Working Intelligence: The AI Optimism Project,” a quasi-public information and marketing campaign centered around artificial intelligence in the workplace. The project has begun with a series of short blog posts featuring Palantir’s customers and their opinions on AI, as well as a “manifesto” that takes aim at both the “doomers” and “pacifiers” of AI. “Doomers fear, and pacifiers welcome, a future of conformity: a world in which AI flattens human difference. Silicon Valley is already selling such bland, dumbed-down slop,” the manifesto declares, arguing that the true power of AI is not to standardize but to “supercharge” workers. Jordan Hirsch, who is spearheading the new project at Palantir, said that there are approximately 20 people working on it and that they plan to launch a corresponding podcast. While Palantir has an obvious commercial interest in dispelling public fears about AI, Karp framed his commitment to the project as something important for society. Fears about job replacement will “feed a kind of weird populism based on a notion that’s not true—that’s going to make the factions on the right and left much, much, much more powerful based on something that’s not true,” he said. “I think correcting that—but not just by saying platitudes, but actually showing how this works, is one of the most important things we have to get on top of.” Karp said he planned to invest “lots of energy and money” into the AI Optimism Project. When asked how much money, he said he didn’t know yet, but that “we have a lot of money, and it’s one of my biggest priorities.” Palantir has seen enormous growth within the commercial side of its business in the last two years, largely due to the artificial intelligence product it released in 2023, called “AIP.” Palantir’s revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time last quarter. And while Palantir only joined the S&P 500 last year, it now ranks as one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its soaring stock price. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Paramount’s new CEO tells employees to return to office full-time or quit ahead of layoffs
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/paramount-skydance-ceo-david-ellison-return-to-office-mandate/

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Paramount CEO David Ellison, in one of his first companywide memos, demanded staff come back to the office five days a week or else find a new job. Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, became CEO of Paramount after its long-stalled $8 billion merger with Skydance was finalized last month. Since then, he has warned employees of efficiency changes, and said in an email that the new return-to-office mandate, which will be pushed out in phases starting January 2026, will “unlock Paramount’s full potential,” Fox News reported. But the mandate came with a not-so-subtle deadline: New York– or Los Angeles–based employees have until Sept. 15 to decide whether they will comply or take a buyout. The company will announce plans for employees based outside New York or L.A. in 2026, Ellison said in the email. “As I said during our town hall, some of the most formative moments of my life happened in rooms where I was a fly on the wall, listening and learning. I’ve never seen that happen on Zoom,” he wrote, according to Fox News. Paramount is the latest company to end COVID-era remote work policies as power shifts back to employers in the context of an increasingly worrying economic environment. Over the past year, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart have all told employees to get back to the office. At times these mandates have been slow to stick or have led to important losses, including for Walmart, which saw its Sam’s Club chief technology officer resign rather than move to the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. The return-to-office mandate comes as Paramount is reportedly preparing to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees in November now that the merger is approved and resolved. As of December 2024, the company had 18,600 employees, Variety reported. Paramount did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Paramount’s revenues for the first half of the year fell 3% year over year to $14 billion from $14.5 billion. The company reported a slight uptick in overall revenue for the second quarter, but saw a 6% decline in its cash cow TV media segment, which includes broadcast operations like CBS and cable networks, including Showtime and Nickelodeon. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Paramount+, increased 15% year over year thanks to a subscription boost and price increases. Post-merger, Paramount has sought deals to spur growth, especially for its streaming services. The company in July signed a $1.5 billion landmark deal to host the animated comedy South Park on Comedy Central and Paramount+ for five years. The company also signed a three-year deal with Legendary Entertainment to market and distribute its theatrical films globally, starting with the new Street Fighter film set to release next year. At the same time, executives previously said $2 billion in potential cost cuts could be realized under the combined company. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

I'm always shocked when I remember Amazon got started way back in 1994. For more than a quarter century, this company was run by itsthe same founder, Jeff Bezos, who built it into America's second-largest employer. He pursued a dizzying array of products, services, businesses, moonshots, and side projects. Then, in the midst of a global pandemic, he stepped aside and Andy Jassy took over as CEO. Jassy was suddenly responsible for more than 1.5 million employees located all over the globe while COVID-19 spread. And he was taking the reins from a boss who'd stamped his unique approach on almost everything at Amazon. Daunting stuff. It's been over four years since then, and Jassy has finally made Amazon his own. That's according to an exclusive inside look at how this new CEO is changing the world's largest e-commerce and cloud company. Superstar reporter Eugene Kim spent many weeks on this project. If you're an Amazon employee, or you're thinking of working there, this is a must-read. Here are some highlights, but go read the whole thing: Costs Before Culture: When Jassy stepped into the top job in 2021, Amazon was ballooning from pandemic-era growth while suffering massive losses. The new CEO couldn't tackle cultural challenges until he first stabilized Amazon's cost structure. That meant big layoffs, project cuts, and tightening the belt at every level. "Arena" Leadership: Some leaders aren't mincing words. One high-level email obtained by Kim bluntly told managers to "step into the arena" and meet higher standards or leave. It's a tone that underscores a harder-edged, performance-first culture. From Spreading Bets to Big Bets: Jassy is rethinking how Amazon innovates. Unlike Bezos, who encouraged wide bets across hundreds of projects, Jassy is concentrating resources on a smaller number of "big bets" with clearer paths to profitability. The Petty Edge of Frugality: The company's legendary frugality now extends to the fine print. Some employees must track how much of a $50 phone allowance is actually work-related, with reimbursements adjusted accordingly. Owners, not employees: Jassy wants staff to think like owners. Would they spend their own money on this project, or that work trip? He sees Amazon as "the world's biggest startup," with a sharper, leaner culture. That's testing how far today's workforce is willing to go along for the ride. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com. Jump to

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: NY Fed Survey Sees Minimal Impact on Jobs From AI Adoption

Highlights Layoffs tied to AI remain rare, with only 1% of service firms reporting job cuts due to AI, and none among manufacturers, though some anticipate layoffs ahead. About 12% of service firms scaled back hiring due to AI, but similar shares are adding AI-skilled workers, suggesting offsets rather than mass job loss. Nearly half of firms plan to retrain employees to use AI, with Fed and PYMNTS surveys showing workers see AI more as a tool for skill augmentation than replacement. Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping hiring decisions in the U.S. labor market, but fears of widespread job loss remain unfounded, according to new regional surveys from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Δ The August regional business surveys found a sharp uptick in AI use among firms in the New York, Northern New Jersey region, with 40% of service firms reported using AI in the past six months, up from 25% this time last year. For the next six months, 44% expect to use AI. Service firms are those in finance, healthcare, business services, hospitality, retail and other industries outside of manufacturing and the public sector. Among manufacturers, usage rose from 16% to 26% over the year. For the next six months, 33% expect to use AI. The New York Fed surveys excluded companies that only used AI to search for information. But instead of expanded AI adoption leading to widespread job losses — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI could reduce up to 70% of jobs — the New York Fed found that only 1% of service firms have cut jobs due to layoffs, with manufacturers not reducing their workforces at all. “Layoffs have been almost nonexistent due to AI use,” Richard Deitz, economic policy advisor at the New York Fed, said during a press call Thursday (Sept. 4) to discuss the surveys. Moreover, manufacturers do not plan to cut jobs as a result of using AI over the next six months. For service firms, 13% plan to reduce their job count in the near future. The strongest labor impact is on reduced hiring. Among service firms, 12% said they hired fewer people in the past six months due to AI use. For the next six months, 23% of service firms said they would do so. Among manufacturers, none reduced hiring in the last six months but 8% plan to do so in the next half year. But plans to reduce hiring are offset by increased hiring of workers with AI know-how: 11% of service firms and 7% of manufacturers. For the next six months, 12% and 14% of service firms and manufacturers plan to hire more AI-adept workers, respectively. Also, workers were more likely to be retrained than let go. A third of service firms and 14% of manufacturers are retraining the existing workforce. For the next six months, 47% of service firms and manufacturers plan to do so. “When we’re looking at the implied economy-wide impacts from our surveys, these impacts are likely to be really limited,” Deitz said. “For those that have a job, they are actually more likely to be retrained than replaced by an AI, which is a clear positive for workers. Moreover, AI has created job opportunities for workers who are skilled in AI use.” A PYMNTS Intelligence report had a similar finding: While most workers surveyed agreed that artificial intelligence poses a systemic risk of job displacement, nearly two-thirds do not believe their jobs are at risk. Moreover, a higher percentage of respondents across occupations see AI as augmenting their skills instead of taking away their jobs. Read more: GenAI: A Generational Look At AI Usage And Attitudes The biggest impact is on job seekers, where AI “likely made it a bit harder” to get employment now and in the near future, Deitz said. The reduced hiring more often affects workers with a college degree. Recent Stanford University research supports the finding that AI is making it harder for young workers to get jobs, especially in fields where generative AI tools can automate tasks. These include software developers, receptionists, translators and customer service agents. The PYMNTS report showed that while 82% of workers who use AI at least weekly say it increases productivity, millennials and Gen Z workers are more likely than older generations to worry that AI can take away their jobs. Overall, 54% are concerned about the technology’s impact on jobs. In the New York Fed surveys, paid AI services were gaining traction: About half of service firms that use AI reported paying for tools, up 16 percentage points from a year earlier. For manufacturers, 46% of manufacturers do so, up from 7% last year. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity AI all have free or paid tiers. The top three uses for AI were the same for both types of businesses, differing only in ranking. For service firms, the top use case is to search for information (54%), followed by marketing and advertising, and business or predictive analytics. For manufacturers, marketing and advertising was at the top (61%), followed by search for information and business or predictive analytics. The findings suggest AI’s effects on jobs are both overstated and underestimated — overstated in the sense that layoffs remain minimal, but underestimated in that hiring is already shifting in ways that make it harder for new entrants and some college graduates to land positions. Still, expected job changes will likely be affected by economic conditions. As Deitz noted, last year about 10% of service firms anticipated layoffs, but very few actually occurred. “What firms are anticipating doing with respect to AI is dependent on economic conditions,” he said.

Title: Record profits, layoffs: Wall Street cheers as workers fear

Time Published: 2025-09-04T18:31:53Z

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Layoffs are grabbing headlines this week. On Tuesday, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it will slash up to 25% of its workforce, or about 3,250 roles — a pattern now visible across many other oil and gas companies. Chevron has likewise announced up to 9,000 cuts likely this year. Too much oil in the market and too little confidence in future demand have squeezed margins across the industry, so companies like Conoco and Chevron are leaning on job cuts to preserve cash flow. It makes sense, even if it’s not a pretty trend. Layoffs at Big Tech companies also appear elevated, but the profit and growth story in that sector could hardly be more different. Even as companies post record second-quarter profits and boast of expanding margins and AI breakthroughs, players large and less-large are slashing headcount. On Wednesday, Salesforce posted a 10% revenue jump to $10.2 billion and an 11% rise in its favored demand metric. Profits surged, and buybacks ballooned by $20 billion. Yet the company also reportedly gutted 4,000 support jobs, with CEO Marc Benioff saying he “needs less heads” as AI agents now handle about a million customer conversations. Oracle is also enjoying its own banner year. Shares are up 33% year to date, hitting record highs this summer as AI cloud demand spiked. Its most recent results, released mid-summer, showed sales growing by 11% to nearly $16 billion. Behind the scenes, however, state filings and worker posts show thousands of jobs disappearing across Seattle, California, Texas, and Kansas — longtime employees included. Oracle's next earnings are due Sept. 9, with analysts predicting more positive financial news. Cisco is another example. The company recently said that hundreds of positions are set to be cut, many of them in software engineering. The announcement came even as the company reported an 8% rise in its recent quarter, with revenue rising to $14.7 billion. It also came on top of deep cuts in 2024, when Cisco eliminated some 5,000 jobs, or roughly 7% of its workforce, as part of a plan to redirect spending toward “high-growth areas.” Cisco stock has risen about 15% year to date, behind some tech competitors, but still well ahead of the overall S&P 500. Microsoft, in its most recent quarter, posted sales of nearly $80 billion, and net income of $27 billion, up 24%, with earnings per share rising in tandem at 24%, too. Shares have risen some 20% this year, and the company has cut its workforce deeply at the very same time — with 15,000 workers laid off so far in 2025. Amazon, which like Microsoft is spending tens of billions on various AI buildouts, has also cut jobs throughout 2025, while also posting rocketing sales and profits. In its most recent release, CEO Andy Jassy expressly tied the growth to AI, saying: “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out as we’ve expanded Alexa+ to millions of customers, continue to see our shopping agent used by many millions of customers, launched AI models like DeepFleet that optimize productivity paths for our 1M+ robots, made it much easier for software developers to write code with Kiro,” on top of similar AI developments. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy concluded. Bucking the overall tech-stock trend, Amazon shares have lagged the market so far this year. But taken together, the message appears clear. Efficiency is in, even if it comes at the expense of payrolls — or perhaps explicitly because it comes at the expense of payrolls. Wall Street keeps rewarding companies that adopt AI while trimming, automating, and streamlining. Meanwhile, for workers, the era of record profits feels more like an era of record precarity.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is scrapping its budget line in the brand's latest shift

Things aren't so good for Good Clean Goop. Less than two years after it launched, Good Clean Goop — the accessible product line from Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand — is shutting down, a company spokesperson confirmed. The line's relationship with Target, its exclusive brick-and-mortar retailer, ended earlier this year. Both the retailer and Goop declined to provide further details about the line's performance. The line launched in 2023 at Target and on Amazon, and boasted about a dozen products, all under $40 — a far cry from the costly products, like a $150 peptide serum, that Goop had become known for. "I'm so excited for more people who are curious about clean beauty — or who simply appreciate a quality cream or a hardworking cleanser — to be able to try our new line of essentials," Paltrow said in a statement ahead of the line's launch. Some products remain available for purchase on Amazon, though more than half are discounted. "Good.clean.goop introduced many new customers to the goop brand," a Goop spokesperson said in a statement. They described it as "part of a broader strategic shift, focusing on its core business and upcoming initiatives where we're seeing significant momentum." There were signs that the line struggled to gain traction. Last year, Puck reported that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target, and two former Goop employees told Business Insider that they expected the partnership to end in early 2025. The brand's Instagram profile has not posted since October 2024. In June, Goop attempted another strategy to reach the masses: partnering with Ulta Beauty to sell its primary beauty line, Goop Beauty, both on Ulta.com and in 800 stores. Paltrow told WWD last month that beauty was the brand's primary revenue driver. Since its 2008 founding, Goop, which has raised about $140 million according to PitchBook, has made several pivots. Goop launched as a media company, though it has since made significant cuts to its editorial staff and folded its magazine. The brand tried its hand at developing books and TV shows, including a Netflix docuseries, but hasn't released any such projects since 2023. A push into the wellness space with a supplement regimen, which the company said generated $100,000 in sales in one day in 2017, did not last, and other initiatives, like the cruise Goop at Sea, have also shut down. In 2024, the company underwent two rounds of layoffs and remained unprofitable, as Business Insider previously reported. Last year, Goop said that it would focus on beauty, fashion, and food moving forward. Jump to

Title: I'm a Gen Xer who's been looking for full-time work for 18 months. After more than 1,000 apps, I'm trying to reinvent myself.

Time Published: 2025-09-04T09:20:02Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert Poe, a 56-year-old former e-commerce director. His identity and former employment have been verified. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career at IBM in digital marketing. My brother used to say to me, "You're always going to have a job." I've been through layoffs and worked at companies that shut down, but I never really had to look for a job in my role. My last position was as director of e-commerce at Badcock Home Furniture. I made $120,000 as my base salary. The company was eventually bought by a company that filed for bankruptcy. I lasted about six months in a new role that I landed. I wasn't worried about finding another job. But that was a year and a half ago. Since then, I've sent out over 1,000 résumés. The experience has been a shock. My wife and I sold our house and moved into an apartment. We've had to claim bankruptcy. I sold my car. We're partially living off of our sons' Social Security and my wife's job. Our daughter, who lives with us, helps pay rent. I pretty much have given up on finding e-commerce director roles. I guess I'm too old. I hear a lot of people saying, "Go start your own business," and "This is the time to reinvent yourself." So at 56, that's what I'm trying to do. I got my real estate license and tried that for a little. I was commuting about an hour each way to sit in an office with a bunch of 20-year-olds, doing exactly what I could have done at home. At some point, I realized that it's not realistic to work off strict commissions and commute to an office when nothing is coming in. So I tried out being an Amazon delivery worker for five months. I'm in shape and I work out. But at the end of the night, I couldn't walk up the stairs. It's a different world, especially when you're not used to being spoken to that way. It's a great side gig if you want some extra money, but it's not enough to live on. In addition to the gig work stuff, I've tried to be entrepreneurial. I launched a digital marketing startup called JBP Media Group with a partner who used to work with me. It will be another six months before any income comes in and I've had money come out of my pocket just to get it going. We've gotten a handful of clients, which is wonderful, and we have some employees offshore to help with some of the work. But when clients pay you $200 a month, you need a lot of those small clients. I've also published a book. I have two 20-year-old twin sons with special needs, and the book is about the expenses that hit special needs families. There are probably around $60,000 a year in expenses per kid, including transportation and insurance. Publishing the book has been a bucket list type of thing, and it's one that keeps your mind going. Starting a company has also kept me busy. Even if I'm working technically for free, it keeps my skills sharp. I keep trying everything on top of interviewing, thinking that something will hit. In the meantime, I have to keep going. I have been putting out about two to five résumés a day. I've met with tons of recruiters and have relationships with some of them. But a recruiter will ask to schedule a call and then never get back to me. I'm hearing more and more of that happening, where you get through an interview round and they put the job on hold or find someone internally. It's depressing. Everybody's saying, "LinkedIn's not the place to be anymore" or "You have to make your résumé different." It's incredibly confusing. It's like they flipped a switch overnight. The system's broken. For Gen X folks, it feels like if you're out of a job, then it's just too bad. Right now, I feel like a failure. But my message to other people is that something will work out, even if you have to go from a six-figure job to making $50,000 a year. For me now, I want to work for the Special Olympics, where I volunteer and coach paddleboarding. Even if it's a pay cut, I can start over, and we'll figure it out. Have you struggled to find a job? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or through the secure messaging app Signal at aalt.19. Jump to

Title: Crystal Dynamics’ and Amazon MGM’s Tomb Raider TV Series Casts Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, Filming Kicks Off in 2026

The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from Variety. This is the same series that was announced in May 2024 with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films. "I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…" For Turner's part, she added that she is "thrilled beyond measure" to be stepping into the role. "She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking." It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio confirmed layoffs last week, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "unaffected," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.

Title: Stop Using Brave Browser
URL: https://www.spacebar.news/stop-using-brave-browser/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T17:24:31Z

Seriously. The Brave web browser has carved out a niche over the past few years as an alternative to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other mainstream web browsers. Some of that has come from its marketing as a privacy-preserving web browser, and it has also been repeatedly evangelized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. If someone recommends Brave to you, you should ignore them, because they are wrong. Brave Browser is a mess of a software project, and the company building it is even worse. Brave Software, the company behind the browser of the same name, was founded by Brendan Eich. He's best known as the creator of JavaScript from his days at Netscape Communications, and he was later the co-founder of Mozilla. He remained at Mozilla Foundation and its for-profit segment, Mozilla Corporation, well into the 2000s. In 2014, he was appointed as CEO of Mozilla Corporation, which immediately caused backlash from at least a few people inside Mozilla and many people outside the organization. Why was appointing Eich as CEO so controversial? It's because he donated $1,000 in support of California's Proposition 8 in 2008, which was a proposed amendment to California's state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Eich wrote a blog post defending himself in 2012, when the donation was initially discovered, where did not apologize and denied the donation made him a bigot: In other words, because he silently donated to causes seeking to strip rights from minority groups instead of directly harassing them, the outrage was unjustified. Okay, Brendan. The appointment was a full-on PR disaster for Mozilla, and as an example of how far-reaching the criticism became, OkCupid started showing a popup to its Firefox visitors about the donations and suggested switching to another browser. Brendan Eich quit after 11 days as CEO. He then went on to create Brave Software and obtain $2.5 million in early funding by late 2015, then another $4.5 million by mid-2016. Here's a bonus fun fact: one of those early investors was Founders Fund, which is operated by billionaire Peter Thiel. He's a regular campaign donor to far-right political candidates, and said in an essay that "I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible." He also keeps funding libertarian “seasteading” ships designed to function as independent cities in international waters (think BioShock), all of which have failed miserably. Targeted advertisements can be incredibly damaging to online privacy, because most of them rely on ad networks that purchase or quietly monitor your online behavior to serve personalized ads. That has given ad blockers a dual mandate — they make the web less annoying (at the expense of web revenue), and protect your privacy online. The advertising industry is fighting back with increasingly-complicated detection methods for ad blockers, but as of right now, it’s still a cat-and-mouse battle. From the start, Brave Software had a different idea than just blocking ads outright. The initial version of Brave allowed some advertisements hosted by the site itself (e.g. pre-roll ads on YouTube), and had a long-term goal of building its own advertising network. Here’s what Brendan Eich said in 2016: Brave’s plan was to remove most of the third-party advertisements in a page, create its own ad units based on data collected by the web browser itself, and then split the revenue with publishers. Brave said originally that it was aiming for at least 55% of the money to go to the publisher, with the eventual goal of giving 70% of the revenue to the publisher. The web browser user would also receive a cut. The Newspaper Association of America responded with cease-and-desist letter to Brave Software, calling the ad replacements “blatantly illegal” and insisting it amounted to “republication” of copyrighted content. Brad Flora, who was previously Director of Business Development at Brave, said this never ended up happening: Brave started a 1,000-user trial of its advertising network in 2018. The program rewarded Brave users with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), based on how long they spent viewing ads and content, which would then be kept in a digital wallet or given to publishers as a sort of tipping system. That system hasn’t significantly changed since then, but some of the ad formats are different now. Brave’s website explains that the ads are served in search results in Brave Search, the New Tab page, the Brave News newsfeed, and notifications. BAT is a cryptocurrency. That means its value is highly volatile, and the initial coin offering (ICO) generated another $35 million for Brave in 2017. Brave users can’t redeem BAT for actual (fiat) money without first transferring it to another cryptocurrency wallet, and publishers/content creators are also paid in BAT. There’s an option for publishers/content creators to automatically convert the tokens earned into real money, but again, the value of BAT changes constantly. Brave’s replacement for ads doesn’t reward users in a meaningful amount (reports in 2021 were around 2-6 BAT per month, which is $0.40-$1.25 on the current exchange rate), and requires publishers and content creators to jump through additional hoops to reclaim lost revenue from ad blockers. If the goal was to create a more fair payment system for content on the web, it has largely failed. It has generated a lot of revenue for Brave, though, so that’s nice. Brave’s BAT was built around the cryptocurrency ecosystem (it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain), which helped it attract users from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts. Brave Software continued to bake in more crypto-adjacent functionality over time, billing itself as the ultimate browser for crypto and web 3.0. A full crypto wallet was added in 2021, replacing the original wallet built around BAT. It supports live and historical market graphs, sending and receiving crypto, managing NFTs, and interacting with decentralized apps (Dapps). The past year has revealed how most of this ecosystem was built on overvalued startups, hype, and outright scams. Here are some of the companies, individuals, and organizations that Brave has worked with in the crypto industry: Brave was also caught up in a privacy scandal in 2020, when it was revealed that the browser was adding affiliate codes to some URLs typed into the address bar. For example, typing in “binance.us” would add Brave’s affiliate link to the end, allowing Brave Software to collect revenue from signups or purchases. An official blog post called that “a mistake,” and the functionality was later turned off. That should have been enough to swear off Brave as a privacy-centric browser forever, considering the entire point of affiliate links is to collect data about the user and traffic source. For example, when you click an Amazon affiliate link in a web article, the publisher can see the exact products you purchase in the timeframe the tracking cookie remains active (which is currently 24 hours). Brave's defenders will point to the revenue sources for other browsers as something similar to Brave's URL replacement experiment. Vivaldi adds sponsored bookmarks on the new tab page, for example. However, I’m not aware of another browser ever rewriting what the user types in the address bar. Ultimately, Brave Browser is the apparatus of an advertising company, a bloated and complicated experience for the average user, and the pet project of the person kicked out of Mozilla for continuing to defend harmful political donations. If you want a privacy-focused web browser, use Firefox or Vivaldi. If you want to support your favorite content creators and publishers, turn on advertisements or support them through the methods they already support (Patreon, Ko-Fi, and so on). Brave Browser is irredeemable, and you should not use it under any circumstances. Tech companies wanted "AI" to represent a bright future. Now it represents every annoyance in our daily lives. Servo was supposed to be Firefox's future. Now it's an independent effort to make a fast and secure web browser engine. FireWire, the Newton PDA, and other technologies from Apple's past are still hiding in macOS. You can download videos and audio as MP3, M4A, OGG, or other audio formats with the yt-dlp command line tool. An inside look at the technology around us.

By Eddie Makuch on September 3, 2025 at 10:37AM PDT Amazon MGM Studios has announced that Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner will indeed play the role of Lara Croft in an upcoming Tomb Raider series. A previous report said Turner had dropped out and the show itself was "dead." Variety and others confirmed the news today that the Tomb Raider TV series is moving ahead. Additionally, Amazon MGM Studios confirmed that filming will begin in January 2026. As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, and executive producer for the series, with Chad Hodge (Single All the Way, Wayward Pines) joining as co-showrunner and executive producer. Shogun director Jonathan van Tulleken has also come aboard as executive producer and director. Waller-Bridge said in a statement, "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out ... Croft is coming ..." Before Turner, the actors Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander brought the character Lara Croft to life in film. For her part, Turner said she is "thrilled beyond measure" to play Croft. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking," she said. The Tomb Raider series for Prime Video was greenlit under the leadership of Amazon MGM Studios boss Jennifer Salke, but Salke exited the company earlier this year amid reports of a power struggle. Salke was said to be personally overseeing the Tomb Raider series. Matthew Belloni of Puck reported in March that the Tomb Raider series went through multiple writers rooms, with "tens of millions" spent on development costs. In addition to producing the TV series, Amazon is publishing the next Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. This new game was never expected to be connected to the TV series. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
