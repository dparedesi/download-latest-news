July 08, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: After Amazon's Hit Show, New Fallout Rumor Makes A Lot More Sense
URL: https://screenrant.com/fallout-games-multiple-projects-bethesda-leak/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
Although the franchise has always been an iconic pillar of the RPG genre, Amazon's Fallout show helped bring the series to a much wider audience of new viewers. Not only was the record-breaking series a hit with plenty of fans, but it also caused a massive spike in player counts for Bethesda's older Fallout games. Despite the show's significant success, Bethesda seemed somewhat unprepared to take advantage of the spike in popularity, which thankfully might be changing this second time around. While it will likely be a long wait until the highly anticipated Fallout 5 makes its appearance, official confirmation of a third season for Fallout means there won't be a content drought for too long. If its first season was anything to go by, the show's follow-ups are likely to be another smashing success for Amazon, which could have some significant benefits for Fallout players. Whether we'll be getting a look at the next entry in the series or some surprise projects, a recent report is a great sign of things to come. As reported by ComicBook, Video Games Chronicle's Jordan Middler made some significant claims regarding the future of the Fallout series after the recent layoffs at Xbox. As a guest on an episode of the Friends Per Second podcast, Middler claimed that "There are multiple Fallout projects in development," which he says includes "that one I'm sure you're all wanting". While the vague statements don't explicitly confirm any specific hopes for future Fallout content, it would honestly be more of a surprise if Bethesda didn't have more Fallout projects in the works. Although the vague rumor isn't too much to go on, the idea that we could see a new major release for the Fallout series following the second or third season of the Fallout show would be a more than welcome surprise. Even if Middler says that we're "not going to be playing this game anytime soon" regarding the biggest project from the studio, it's only a part of what's coming to the series in the future. Bethesda has confirmed the upcoming Fallout 5 won't be released until some time after the next Elder Scrolls game, so it's much more likely that the next big project for the series will be in the form of a remaster. Much like Bethesda's latest The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it's not hard to see a modern overhaul of Fallout New Vegas or the heavily rumored remake of Fallout 3 being a massive success for the studio. Even if Fallout 3 would be the more likely candidate given its in-house development at Bethesda, Fallout New Vegas is easily the more popular choice among fans, given its cult classic nature and significant ties to the show. Oblivion Remastered has been massively successful, and if a Fallout 3 remaster wants to achieve the same result, some changes will need to be made. While Bethesda may not be quite ready to announce a new sequel or even a remake by the time Fallout's second season rolls around, there's still plenty of room to take advantage of its popularity. Even mobile games like Fallout Shelter show just how much potential the series can have in other mediums, not to mention the Fallout 76 MMO still going strong years after release to show there's still plenty of love to be had for the Fallout franchise.

Title: David Ellison’s $8B Paramount Takeover Inches Forward as Drama Surrounds Deal
URL: https://observer.com/2025/07/david-ellisons-8b-paramount-takeover-inches-forward-as-drama-surrounds-deal/

Full Content:
A second 90-day extension on Paramount Global’s proposed merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media was triggered yesterday (July 7), giving regulators, company executives and the Federal Communications Commission more time to finalize and agree on the deal’s terms. One key hurdle remains: the FCC’s approval to transfer CBS’s broadcast licenses to Skydance, which must come from a commission currently led by Trump-appointed Republican Brendan Carr. Importantly, any ongoing negotiations will now play out against what’s presumed to be a more favorable regulatory climate, following Paramount’s controversial $16 million settlement with President Trump announced last week.

By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. That legal clash with the President stemmed from Trump’s lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with then–Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been unfairly edited. The settlement, which has drawn sharp scrutiny, is just the latest twist in what’s been perhaps Paramount’s most turbulent year in recent memory—a saga that’s seen the company shift from Redstone family control to the edge of a new era under David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. For decades, Paramount embodied everything old Hollywood stood for, from its air of glamour to its dynastic leadership. This is the studio that gave moviegoers The Godfather and Top Gun and TV audiences hits like Cheers and Frasier. But with a merger in motion to hand the reins to Skydance, Paramount is now poised to become something very different: a tech-forward brand working to reinvent itself in an industry that’s long since moved on from the old rules. Needless to say, the road to this moment hasn’t been smooth. If anything, the story of how Paramount got here reads less like a typical business evolution and more like one of Taylor Sheridan’s soapy dramas on Paramount+, this one featuring a media dynasty clinging to power as its empire is carved up by outsiders. The $16 million settlement with Trump wasn’t just about clearing a legal hurdle; it was also seen as a way to neutralize a potential political threat. Inside Paramount, there were real fears that Trump could use regulatory leverage to derail the Skydance merger. That concern now seems far from hypothetical. On July 3, Trump appeared to confirm the existence of a “side deal” with Ellison that’s worth between $32 million and $35 million. He was referencing what Fox Business’s Charlie Gasparino first reported as a private commitment by Ellison to run PSAs supporting Trump-aligned causes. Paramount has denied any knowledge of such an arrangement, but Trump’s comments are likely to intensify worries about editorial independence within CBS News. “What you’re seeing now is all must pay tribute to the king,” said Jon Stewart, whose The Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central, during a recent appearance on The Bill Simmons Podcast. Stewart added that he, too, is bracing for whatever comes next: “I’m in a spot where I can do [The Daily Show] on Monday until the company is bought out by people that don’t want anything to do with The Daily Show.” South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, whose series streams on both Comedy Central and Paramount+, took to social media to slam the merger’s fallout for their show. “This merger is a [expletive] and it’s [expletive] up South Park,” they wrote in a post circulating on Instagram, responding to a delayed premiere announcement. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.” The wheels for much of this were set in motion back in late 2023, when Skydance first began exploring a merger with Paramount Global. At the time, cord-cutting was accelerating, streaming losses were mounting, and Wall Street had largely lost faith in Paramount’s long-term strategy. Then–CEO Bob Bakish was holding merger talks with several potential partners, including Warner Bros. Discovery. But it was Skydance’s interest that kicked everything into gear. From the start, the deal was complicated by one name: Redstone. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, owns the family firm that effectively holds the keys to the company. Any buyer had to make her whole first, setting the stage for months of boardroom drama, internal power struggles and shareholder confusion. Skydance’s original offer, roughly $2 billion in cash and stock, triggered immediate backlash. Investors balked at the terms. Paramount’s special committee stalled. And in April 2024, Bakish was pushed out reportedly over disagreement with Redstone. The deal collapsed, and rival bidders began circling. Redstone seemed open to anything—until she wasn’t. Then, in a quiet but dramatic reversal, the Skydance talks were revived. This time, the restructured deal offered shareholders a better payout and a more straightforward path forward. By July 2024, an agreement was finalized: Skydance would merge with Paramount in an $8 billion transaction, ending the Redstone family’s decades-long grip on the studio. For many, the Redstones were synonymous with Paramount. Sumner Redstone built a sprawling media empire with ruthless focus. His daughter Shari spent years defending that legacy. But in the end, not even she could hold off the tide. Streaming hadn’t delivered, ad revenue was shrinking, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon were outpacing Paramount at every turn. David Ellison has laid out a vision centered on A.I.-assisted production, a renewed focus on tentpole films and reshaping Paramount+ into a leaner, more viable streaming platform. Still, major hurdles remain. Layoffs have already impacted hundreds. And whether Skydance can actually pull off a successful integration—blending old-school Hollywood with a tech-forward playbook—is far from guaranteed. Ellison and his team will face pressure from all directions: investors, regulators, unions and the press. But at least for now, for the first time in years, Paramount’s future is beginning to take shape—even if it means letting go of everything it once was.

Title: Microsoft reportedly focusing on new Fallout games and remasters after Xbox Studios upheaval

Considering Fallout 76 debuted in 2018, fans of the post-apocalyptic RPG series are anxious for new quests. Although Bethesda has yet to confirm any release dates, rumors suggest that multiple games are in development. In the Friends Per Second podcast, Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle confirmed that Fallout 3 Remastered is still in the works. Fallout 5 is also planned, but may not arrive until 2030 or later. However, Middler also referenced a potential Fallout 2 remaster and New Vegas follow-up. Part of the broadcast centered on the recent turmoil in Xbox Game Studios. The loss of 9,000 Microsoft jobs impacted developers, leading to untimely deaths of titles like Perfect Dark. After the layoffs, Microsoft wants to focus on profitable Xbox titles and IPs, like Fallout. Fallout 3 Remastered may be one of the first projects that's ready for public consumption. It's believed that Obisidian Entertainment is partnering with Virtuous, who developed Oblivion Remastered. Still, initial leaks indicated a 2023 release date, and Bethesda hasn't provided an official update. When the title inevitably arrives, players can expect Unreal Engine 5 to power its revamped visuals. For fans who don't consider Fallout 76 a mainline game, it's been a decade since Fallout 4 arrived. Insiders don't anticipate Fallout 5 surfacing anytime soon. Sadly, Middler also doesn't see any evidence of rushed development. What's even more unclear is the timeline for other Xbox games hinted at in the podcast. Bethesda and Obsidian are considering various spinoffs and remasters. One project in particular could excite fans of the 2010 Fallout: New Vegas. For now, the TV show will have to tide supporters over until any new Fallout game is ready. The second season of the Amazon-produced series will premiere in December 2025.

Title: A.I. Drives Job Cuts Across Silicon Valley Giants: By the Numbers

Tech layoffs are nothing new in Silicon Valley, a region long shaped by boom-and-bust hiring cycles, speculative investment and shifting economic conditions. But in recent months, executives have offered a different explanation for job cuts: the rapid rise of A.I. So far in 2025, nearly 400 tech companies have announced layoffs, affecting close to 94,000 employees, according to TrueUp’s tech layoff tracker. Many of these roles are expected to be replaced—directly or indirectly—by A.I.-driven efficiencies. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Salesforce, for example, cut 1,000 roles earlier this year, redirecting hiring toward sales roles focused on A.I.-powered products. CEO Marc Benioff said last month that A.I. currently handles 30 to 50 percent of the company’s work, reducing the need for roles in fields like software engineering and customer support. Despite the job cuts, Salesforce remains financially strong, reporting $9.8 billion in revenue for the February-April quarter, an 8 percent year-over-year increase. Microsoft, the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, has also made significant cuts in 2025. The company laid off around 9,000 employees in July, following a separate round of more than 6,000 in May. Software engineers have borne the brunt of these reductions. Though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the layoffs to A.I., the technology’s growing role inside the company is undeniable. In April, CEO Satya Nadella disclosed that A.I. now writes about 30 percent of Microsoft’s code—a figure he expects to climb. Microsoft isn’t alone in its internal shift toward A.I. At Google, well over 30 percent of new code includes A.I. generated suggestions, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed earlier this year. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has described developing an A.I. agent with coding abilities comparable to a mid-level engineer as one of the company’s top goals for 2025. Startups across Silicon Valley are following suit, increasingly requiring A.I. fluency in hiring and day-to-day operations. In a March memo to staff, Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke wrote that A.I. use is now “a fundamental expectation,” adding that any team requesting additional headcount or resources must first prove that the task can’t be handled by A.I. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn echoed a similar stance the following month. He told employees that headcount increases would only be approved if teams demonstrate the need for human involvement over automation. A.I. proficiency, he added, will also play a bigger role in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo will stop using contractors for tasks that A.I. can complete. With 2025 only halfway through, A.I.-driven workforce changes are poised to continue. In a June memo, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy laid out the company’s sweeping integration of A.I. across areas like shopping, AWS, and internal operations. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time,” he wrote, “but in the next few years, we expect this will reduce our corporate workforce as we gain efficiency from using A.I. extensively across the company.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Food delivery robots carrying everything from pizza to hamburgers are trying their luck on city streets and college campuses. It’s not clear if it is the future or a hilarious misstep. Visitors to Hollywood have probably seen them around, where they have been in operation since 2020, but there’s now an effort to spread usage to college towns. The Wall Street Journal wrote about how the robots are getting flipped over, stuck in snow piles and some students have been found to sit on them, or trip over them, when drinking. Companies like Coco Robotics, which makes food robots, noted they are a huge hit on social media, and kids find them cute. Tokyo also has seen a growth in food robots but, in general, has residents who are more respectful of the robots and it seems to be going a little better than U.S. college campuses. Question: Will food delivery robots be a success in the U.S.? Caroline Freund, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy YES: If you build them, they will deliver. When Uber launched the first U.S. ride-hailing app in 2009, people asked who would get in the personal car of a stranger? Uber’s market cap is now nearly $200 billion. Americans love food delivery. Where labor is scarce, streets are easy to navigate, and people are hungry, robots will thrive. College campuses are great places to innovate, expand and refine service. Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic Research YES: Deliveries by robots certainly have potential to work well, particularly in congested urban areas having access provided by ADA compliant streets and buildings as well as ability to enter elevators. They clearly need some form of security as they inevitably will be misused, perhaps like Tesla cars having cameras to record vandalizing and to prevent misappropriating of their operations. Flying drones may avoid some problems navigating terrestrial obstacles and potentially be less intrusive and faster. Alan Gin, University of San Diego YES: There are some current problems, but the technology will undoubtedly get better in the future. Some Americans like the convenience of having their food delivered, and the food robots can do it at a lower cost than delivery services. Yes, college students may drink too much and try to abuse the robots, but that is likely to decrease as the novelty of the robots wears off and they become a more accepted part of life. David Ely, San Diego State University YES: College campuses, resorts and dense urban areas would seem to provide a suitable environment in which food delivery robots can be successful. There are many prospective customers in these markets who will appreciate the convenience and novelty of this innovation. Delivery via robot can be less expensive than alternatives that require a human. Experience will soon allow businesses to determine the distances, sidewalk conditions, regulatory constraints and weather conditions where robots can be successful. Ray Major, economist YES: But not in their current form, the current tech needs more time to mature. Think of this as a V1.0 of a generic personalized delivery service. As with many V1.0s, the concept is ahead of its time, and its implementation needs to be refined. Inventions like Apple’s Newton laid the foundation for iPhones. Segways failed, but in another form became e-bikes and set the stage for micro-mobility. Give it a few years and it might compete with Amazon. James Hamilton, UC San Diego YES: At least in some settings. In controlled environments like college campuses, hospitals and large corporate complexes delivery robots are already proving to be successful. The extent to which they can succeed in tougher urban environments is another question. They pose a new potential sidewalk hazard for the elderly and those of us with disabilities. And it’s yet another step leading people to greater social isolation with less interaction with real humans. Norm Miller, University of San Diego YES: Eventually these will be perfected and become part of normal operations, just as self-driving cars are inevitable. I’ve seen them used in Asian restaurants. I once had tenants that stole every campus machine not bolted down, and if these guys are not in jail, then the challenge for U.S. public delivery robots is that they are too easy to steal from, or abuse, and none, at present, have any defense mode like electric-shocks. Hmmm? Chris Van Gorder, Scripps Health YES: I don’t know if they will be successful in the general populations just like I’m not sure drones will be either, but in select communities like college campuses or major business campuses, they could be quite helpful and efficient. Scripps has been using food delivery robots or “TUGs” to deliver patient meals to different nursing units at Scripps La Jolla for years and it’s likely the use of these robots will be expanded in years to come. Phil Blair, Manpower YES: The U.S. will become early adopters of any technology that improves service and saves money. Jamie Moraga, Franklin Revere NO: Like the Bird and Lime e-scooters, these “cute” food delivery robots are likely to face significant challenges. While the intention is good and the concept promising, the reality is that these robots will be vandalized, damaged, robbed or intentionally destroyed. Additionally, they could pose liability issues and dangers to walkways and roadways, not to mention the threat of overregulation by local municipalities. The U.S. still has a way to go before food delivery robots can be successful. Gary London, London Moeder Advisors YES: I’ve seen them in Westwood (Los Angeles) and New York City. Early autos were probably targeted by horse and carriage people. Once the novelty wears off and delivery robots become ubiquitous, I’m sure they will just blend into the urban fabric. Change is hard, but the combination of densification in the cities, labor costs and technological advances makes them inevitable. We will eventually see a coupling of autonomous vehicles and robotics deliver to the suburbs, as well. Bob Rauch, R.A. Rauch & Associates YES: Food delivery robots are already gaining significant traction in the U.S., particularly in urban areas such as Los Angeles, San Jose and Dallas. Companies like Uber Eats and Serve Robotics have deployed over 2,000 delivery bots. Each of our hotels has a “service robot” for food, beverages and supplies, and customer satisfaction is high. Delivery speed and cost efficiency are improving, which is critical since uninformed politicians want to raise the minimum wage by 45%. Austin Neudecker, Weave Growth YES: Robot couriers may stumble today, but over a longer horizon, their spread feels inevitable. Early pilots will hit curbs, pranksters and regulatory roadblocks. Many will fail. Yet technology improves rapidly, labor continues to tighten, and consumers expect increased convenience. There will be a period of adaptation and acclimation for a diverse population, spanning early users to luddites. Ultimately, simple economics will prevail. Expect a messy adjustment marred by layoffs, zoning fights and skepticism. Have an idea for an Econometer question? Email me at phillip.molnar@sduniontribune.com. Follow me on Threads: @phillip020

Title: Lara Croft is popping up everywhere except in a new Tomb Raider game

World of Tanks collaboration announced. Fans eager to hear more about the next Tomb Raider game are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure. Since Shadow of the Tomb Raider wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of Netflix's animated series, as well as Brawlhalla, Call of Duty, Dead by Daylight, Magic the Gathering, Fall Guys, Pinball FX, and now even World of Tanks as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here, in my opinion the best Lara. The new trailer for World of Tanks, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game. Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games. As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series. But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider games rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around the next mainline Tomb Raider game. In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well". Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics has been subject to layoffs, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time. Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider. I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.

Title: The stock market's biggest bet is setting investors up for a smackdown
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/massive-ai-investment-slowing-economy-recession-stock-market-crash-earnings-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-07-07T08:04:01Z

Wall Street really needs AI to live up to the hype. A lot has been said about the emerging technology's world-changing potential: Its ability to create stunningly realistic images and videos, ace the LSAT and the MCAT, and complete rote research tasks. You could argue it's ready to augment — or even replace — entry-level jobs. These features have investors up and down the Street very excited. Staunch supporters like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives say AI could revolutionize the human experience. Research desks from big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have given subtler nods to the prospect of AI as a productivity and profit booster, which could provide an undercurrent to stock market success over the next several years. In fact, analysts are counting on the AI mania to fuel the market even as the White House's chaotic trade policy eats into corporate America's profit potential. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to grow 8% this year, a fairly average showing for an anything-but-average year. What is notable is just how much of that growth relies on the tech sector: Silicon Valley companies are expected to boost their earnings by 21% — the highest growth of any sector. By contrast, profits for retailers are forecast to grow a measly 2.5%. Within the tech sector, semiconductor companies — one of the most globally exposed industries on the stock market — are expected to supercharge profit this year, with a projected climb of 49%. This enthusiasm is a signal Wall Street is betting that demand for AI's use cases will supersede tariff turmoil or job market wobbles. AI's growth has been incredible, and its adoption has been strong enough to leave its fingerprints on economic data sets like business investment and manufacturing spending. Yet no matter how rabid the world is about AI's possibilities, the amount that investors are relying on the tech to fuel the market's gains — especially in the face of rising economic uncertainty — feels short-sighted. Tech stocks helped the market recover from its April malaise, yet earnings expectations and economic momentum are even weaker than they were at the lowest point of the sell-off. This combination leaves the stock market in a precarious spot: Either AI needs to live up to the hype, or investors could be looking at a gnarly second half of the year. One way to tell the story of human history is through our technology — the lightbulb, the calculator, the tractor, the computer all stand as markers to our societal progress and have helped drive the level of efficiency and productivity we enjoy. Tech has perhaps played an equally prominent role in our investment portfolios. The Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are collectively worth $18 trillion, or about 33% of the S&P 500's total market value. Together, their stock prices have increased 330% over the past five years, compared with a 100% rise in the S&P 500. It makes sense. Big Tech's products have become deeply integrated into our daily lives, and that level of ubiquity has also captured Wall Street's attention. Venture capital fundraising reached a record in the first quarter amid a huge appetite for AI investment, and S&P 500 companies mentioned AI more than tariffs on second-quarter conference calls. The $65 trillion US stock market may be particularly gripped by Big Tech's ups and downs these days, but it hasn't always been this way. Tech has averaged about 20% of the S&P 500's market value over the past decade, including 13% in the five years before COVID. The dominance is not set in stone, and while the wider market's fortunes are tied to tech now, that may not always be the case. While the stock market may seem like one big proxy for the tech sector's explosive growth right now, there is one deeper connection that should draw investors' attention. Over time, the S&P 500 has been attached at the hip to the fate of the broader US economy. Eight of the past 12 market crashes — S&P drops of 20% or more — overlapped with recessions. No matter how high-flying an industry is, recessions tend to pull stock prices and business hopes back to Earth. The internet revolutionized the world in the late 1990s, and the explosion in social media dominated the 2010s, but the information sector has shed employees and seen share prices fall in the past three recessions. Given that setup, we've set the stage for a portfolio smackdown of the ages. Economists are worried a recession is coming, yet investors are surprisingly upbeat about AI's prospects — so upbeat that they've bid S&P 500 tech stocks to nearly a record high. Sell-side analysts who evaluate company-level trends are similarly optimistic. But in the real economy, layoffs are growing, and hiring has ground to a halt. The sharply diverging views between economists and stock analysts mean someone has to be wrong. The freight train that is AI adoption — a three-year story of rapid innovation and progress — could collide with a massive wall from historic tariffs, high interest rates, and low consumer confidence. What's particularly rich about this is that tech companies are the most exposed sector to global tariffs. They gather the highest percentage of revenue internationally, plus they have the most suppliers and factories outside US borders. In fact, semiconductor companies — the firms providing chips for AI technology — are expected to hit that aforementioned 49% earnings growth despite generating 67% of their revenue abroad and sourcing 70% of their supplies from overseas. Some analysts believe that if AI hopes can keep the stock market chugging along, maybe it can do the same to the economy. After all, companies invested an inflation-adjusted $2.2 trillion on computers and other processing equipment last quarter, about one-seventh of the $16 trillion Americans spent on goods and services. Investing more in AI does ultimately help boost the economy, but that $2 trillion is peanuts compared with the real engine of the US economy. Americans' spending accounts for about 70% of GDP — by far the biggest driver of output — and spending has dropped in each of the past nine recessions. If tariffs intimidate consumers and lead to layoffs that decimate American incomes, then the economy is probably bound for a crisis — whether the robots pan out or not. And based on history, an economic crisis could topple the stock market. The math shows us that AI isn't much of a match for some effects of tariffs and may not logistically be enough to save the economy from ruin. Your portfolio's outcome may be a different story, though. This is when I have to introduce you to one of the most frustrating adages of investing: The stock market is not the economy. The economy is the value that we create — the hard assets, the cash spent, the paychecks we get. Stocks are an expression of that value, but they use the present reality to project future expectations. AI's impact on the economy may not bear out through numbers. But in your portfolio, AI's influence depends on how willing we are to collectively dream up better days ahead in terms of what AI is capable of and how much money AI-dominant firms will amass in the years to come. Dreaming is already a big part of the AI trade. S&P 500 tech companies' estimated earnings grew about 50% in 2023 and 2024, yet their share prices jumped 112%. Nothing is cut-and-dried when it comes to the stock market. It is the ultimate tangled web of logic, psychology, and mixed incentives. The stock market's future depends on investors' ability to dream, and people are willing to dream when they feel confident in the present moment. The problem is, investors are awfully confident about tech stocks right now. S&P 500 tech companies made up about 23% of total index profits in the first quarter, yet their shares account for 32% of the S&P 500's value. To close that gap, tech profits would have to grow 40%, or tech stocks would have to drop 29% from their end-of-June levels. Stocks can thrive when expectations are higher than reality, but in these conditions, they require reasons to stay hopeful. The problem arises when investors aren't willing to dream. When they're too focused on present issues to give compelling stories the benefit of the doubt. Or in big market drops, crushed by financial strain. Then, the numbers matter. People claw for any concrete evidence of AI's value. They demand proof of profits, even though companies are spending money on a pivot to the next big thing. Stock prices adjust, and if you hold a swath of US stocks or index funds, your money is probably heavily exposed to this reality check. This is what happened in 2000. Investors were willing to dream about this brave new technology called the World Wide Web until interest rates climbed too high and the reality of how much computing was needed for Y2K was found to be way overblown. Suddenly, the dream died, and tech stock prices came back down to reality. These days, we all know that dream wasn't completely off base. Yet share prices took an 80% crash before the promise of the new tech came to fruition. This is what I worry about the most in the clash between AI and the economy. We're somewhere between AI saving the world and being an overhyped bust of a technology that can be ripped off by another country. I'm not foolish enough to call this a bubble, and I think AI will eventually deliver benefits for our economy. We're not there yet, though, even though investors like to think so. It takes years for big technological trends to take hold, and productivity usually shines through when workers feel empowered and companies feel comfortable expanding. That's far from the case right now — business confidence is in the dumps, so we're in the opposite scenario. When the economy is getting weaker, it's best to grasp onto what's real in your portfolio. And there's a striking gap between AI and reality.

Title: Microsoft Washes Its Hands Of Ad Tech; Google’s Network To Get Work

Call It ‘Don’t Invest’ Microsoft is undergoing its second round of massive layoffs in as many months, Bloomberg reports. The details on the latest round are still unknown, but Microsoft Advertising was keenly affected by layoffs in May, which fell hardest on legacy product and engineering roles. But regardless of how the latest layoffs play out, Microsoft is clearly deprioritizing – if not wholesale abandoning – much of its third-party ad tech: i.e., former AppNexus products, a publisher ad server and PromoteIQ, its retail media acquisition. Microsoft is also calling it quits on Invest, the one-time AppNexus DSP, which is shutting down in early 2026. PromoteIQ went the way of the dodo last year. Having had a taste of third-party programmatic tech, Microsoft appears to be spitting most of it back out after extracting the bits it still finds valuable. Yet Microsoft Advertising says it remains “committed to our end-to-end platforms that help our clients reach the audiences they need wherever they are across the open web,” a spokesperson told AdExchanger in 2023 for a story about a reorg related to the former AppNexus. “Nothing has changed here,” they added. (Okay.) After those statements were made, it would be just another 18 months before Microsoft’s DSP was given its notice of pending termination. Google’s Pub Crawl Google wants to get back into the good graces of publishers, which isn’t easy, considering Google’s AI searches are siphoning their traffic. Oh, and not to mention a landmark antitrust case regarding Google’s sell-side ad tech. But Google is now growing its sell-side ad tech enterprise sales teams, The Information reports. Google Ad Manager’s (GAM) clientele indexes to smaller businesses that are typically less willing to pay ad premiums, which means publishers get relatively lower rates via GAM. One publisher saw “a lower percentage of revenue coming from Google’s advertising technology tools than they did three years ago,” according to The Information. Google’s ad network, which encompasses GAM and accounts for money paid out to publishers, has been declining for years, even as Google’s overall revenue has skyrocketed. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, Google announced a new paywall product called Offerwall that gives readers a variety of options to access articles, such as paying a one-time fee or watching an ad. Perhaps Google is shining its sell-side business in advance of a potential forced divestiture, speculates The Information. Or Google could genuinely see a need to shore up its sell-side ad tech due to market share gains by vendors like PubMatic, Magnite and Amazon. Regardless, Google has a steep mountain to climb if it wants to regain its standing with publishers. Meta-Friendship Meta has been quietly developing chatbots that proactively engage with users, Business Insider reports. The goal, per documentation from Alignerr, the AI chatbot vendor working with Meta on the project, is to “provide value for users and ultimately help to improve re-engagement and user retention.” For creators, the chatbots could respond to comments and fans on their behalf. For brands, it’s an organic way to retarget people. And users might turn to specialized chatbots for recipe ideas, say, or music recommendations. Meta already laid out its vision of a future where AI chatbots populate its platform indistinguishably from real people. Mark Zuckerberg frames this work as a potential fix for the “loneliness epidemic” afflicting Meta users and people in general. It hasn’t been smooth sailing, though. Earlier this year, Meta had to frantically delete its first AI chatbot friends, which came off as painfully cringe to actual humans.

Title: After a Year of High-stakes Financing, Saks Turns Back to High-stakes Retailing

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The luxury department store has access to the funds it needs to operate now; the question is how well it will square up to a tough retail market. Deputy Managing Editor The year since Saks and Neiman Marcus Group cut their landmark $2.7 billion deal has been dominated not by talk of a new luxury retail giant or a modern merchant force taking shape. Instead, it’s been all about the rough and tumble of high-stakes corporate finance. On that score, it’s been a story of quick and agile dealmaking that would be surprising or just unbelievable from almost anyone else but Richard Baker, executive chairman of what is now Saks Global. Related Articles Financial S&P Cuts Saks Global's Credit Rating to CC Fashion Features From Sex Clubs to Castles, Latex to Upcycling, Berlin Fashion Week Had Something for Everyone Consider this: You May Also Like And then things really got started. Hudson’s Bay was spun off and went bankrupt, Saks and Neiman’s vendors were thrown into a tailspin by a yearlong schedule to repay past due bills and 90-day payment terms on all shipments going forward. And bondholders — some of whom seem to haven’t bothered to read some very important fine print — revolted when they learned their debt wasn’t directly secured by the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship. Saks then lined up $350 million in new financing in May only to ditch that in favor of $600 million in financing last month from a group of bondholders jockeying for a better position in the capital structure. From the outside, the company has appeared to be lurching from one crisis to the next. And from the inside, it’s seemingly been a nightmare. But last week, new money in hand, Saks made a crucial $120 million interest payment on the bonds. It’s said to be paying vendors on time under the new terms and Marc Metrick, chief executive officer, has even floated the possibility of making back payments earlier than planned. “As we progress over the next few months, if we see a return to what we believe to be normalized receipt flow, we plan to evaluate the possibility of accelerating the timeline to pay back past due balances to our brand partners,” Metrick told vendors in a memo last month that was obtained by WWD. At least for now, the Saks story is no longer a tale about financing. Everyone inside and out agrees that Saks has the money to get through this year and sources close to the company maintain that it has the financial wherewithal to last much longer even if Christmas doesn’t turn out to be a blockbuster season. One source said Saks’ outside auditors gave the company a clean bill of health — good for at least a year — after the $350 million in financing was lined up and now that’s been upsized to a potential total of $600 million, giving it even more cushion. Right now, the future of Saks is not about its ability to wrangle investors or lenders, but the company’s retail savvy and its ability to push what Metrick has called a “reset” of luxury retail through an increasingly complicated retail market. “All we heard about is ‘We’re running out of money,'” said Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, summing up the bondholder take on the company. “’We need money for inventory, we need money to make interest payments.’ Money, money, money. So OK, we got you set up, you told us you needed this much money, now you show us that you know what to buy and you bought the right inventory and you know how to sell it to make a reasonable profit.” That’s the trick in retail anyway — and one that requires finesse in good times and real skill in tough ones, like now when consumers are skittish and President Donald Trump’s trade war is still disrupting supply. Big retail mergers are dicey to start with. “Now, they have control of the best high-end retailers,” Hynes said. “In theory it should work out. Nobody’s going to open a new high-end retailer tomorrow. It’s just not going to happen. So they got the market cornered. In theory, if anything’s going to work, this should work. Everybody says, ‘Rich people always have money, this should work out.’ However, if you look at history, combining retailers has never worked out.” That point could be argued, kind of — the Federated-May mega merger worked for a time and changed the retail landscape, but that company, now Macy’s Inc., is now morphing again for a new age. But nobody argues that Saks is working in a tough space. “Department stores are not the best neighborhood to be operating in,” said Mickey Chadha, the Moody’s Investors Service debt analyst who follows Saks. “They’re relying on cost cuts, layoffs, efficiencies between the two companies,” Chadha said. “And that’s all great. If you can accomplish that, you’re definitely better for your bottom line. However, you have to grow, you have to grow. And their sales have been declining quite dramatically in the last couple of years. So if you don’t grow, there’s only so much you can do in synergies and cost cuts. “This $600 million of new monies that we’re talking about is great,” he said. “It gives them more runway to get the ship back on course. But it’s not going to be the end all. If they continue to burn cash, that $600 million will then disappear again in the next 12 months, and then they’ll need more capital. The holiday is going to be key for them.” Holiday, next year and beyond relies not on raising more money or courting investors, but on making the big Saks reset work. It’s a complicated bit of work for Metrick. Saks Global is combining operations for the two nameplates, reestablishing trust with vendors, cementing the new payment terms, expanding through a luxury shop on Amazon and looking at brands in new ways with its Authentic Luxury Group joint venture. Somewhere in there could be a bright future for the idea of the luxury department store, which has suffered blow after blow since the bankruptcy of Barneys New York in 2019. There is no shortage of brands with real gripes against Saks as it just now starts paying bills due years ago. But some luxury labels are also sensing new potential ahead — and brands both large and small say Saks Global is vital to their businesses and its survival is key. One adviser to independent designer brands said they are getting more excited about Saks’ shop on Amazon, which launched with 50 brands and is said to be bringing new shoppers into the business. “Are we going to actually see more sales through e-commerce than we’re seeing in the physical stores?” the adviser wondered. “How does the retail footprint shrink or change?” That refocuses the narrative around Saks back to where it really should be — its retail fortunes.

Title: The Broken Microsoft Pact: Layoffs and Performance Management
URL: https://danielsada.tech/blog/microsoft-pact/
Time Published: 2025-07-06T22:54:21Z
Full Content:
When you join Microsoft, you hear stories about people who’ve been there for 20 years, who grew up with the company, who never had to worry about sudden changes (maybe except for 2008). The performance management system had its quirks, but there was an understanding that if you did solid work, you’d have a place. But something shifted. Maybe it was the market, maybe it was the pressure to stay competitive with companies that move faster and pay more. The implicit agreement that made lower compensation feel acceptable started to crack. For decades, Microsoft operated under an unspoken agreement with its employees—what I call “the pact.” The deal was simple: We’ll pay you 20-50% below market rate, but in exchange, you get stability, reasonable work-life balance, and most importantly, no layoffs. This wasn’t written in any employee handbook, but everyone understood it. It was the Microsoft way. For many strong performing engineers, this was an attractive trade-off. You might not get rich as quickly as your friends at startups, but you could plan your life around stability. You could get a mortgage, start a family, and sleep well knowing your job wasn’t going anywhere. According to layoffs.fyi, Microsoft has laid off around 30,000 people in the last two years. To put this in context: that’s roughly 13% of Microsoft’s workforce, and while the entire tech industry saw significant layoffs (Meta, Google, Amazon all made major cuts), Microsoft’s situation stands out because of their historical commitment to employment stability. Many people are confused about this departure from Microsoft’s traditional approach. As a former employee, I want to share my perspective on why this shift was almost expected. While economic factors certainly contributed, Microsoft’s performance management challenges made layoffs a more attractive option than addressing individual performance issues systematically. Microsoft’s performance management has always been atrocious on both sides of the ruthlessness/leniency scale. In the Ballmer era, the forced stack ranking of employees. Essentially a system where managers had to grade their teams on a curve, with a predetermined percentage forced into “underperforming” categories regardless of actual performance, caused people to live in this fear environment. Even if you had a team of stellar performers, someone had to be labeled as bottom 10%. This led to internal competition, backstabbing, and people gaming the system by avoiding high-performing teams or sabotaging colleagues. This caused great attrition and unfavorable business outcomes for Microsoft. The system was so universally hated that when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, eliminating stack ranking was one of his first major moves. The opposite became true: it seems managers had to fight HR to get someone on their team out. I personally saw the bad side of this. I had a co-worker who had no productive outcomes for a year, and it took a year of continued documentation to get him fired. This also caused a downstream effect on team morale, as he was still getting rewards and a salary similar to other people. Sadly, one of the tradeoffs you have to understand is that at the same level, over the same year, the difference in pay between someone at the highest level of performance versus someone who passably does their job does not create enough differentiation for most levels lower than principal, barring random exceptional one-off stock grants (which also don’t help retention, due to their randomness). This causes the system to not be a meritocracy, with “passing by” being the default. I’ll acknowledge upfront that Microsoft is a massive, diverse company with thousands of managers and teams. My experiences reflect specific orgs, specific timeframes (2016-2022), and specific leadership chains. Your mileage may vary dramatically depending on your team, your manager, and your timing. I recognize that some teams and managers at Microsoft do provide strong performance differentiation, meaningful career growth, and excellent employee experiences. However, these patterns were consistent enough across my tenure, conversations with colleagues from different orgs, and observations of broader company trends that I believe they represent systemic issues rather than isolated incidents. The goal isn’t to dismiss positive experiences but to highlight structural challenges that affect enough employees to warrant discussion. For me, coming from outside the US where employment contracts offer significantly more protection, at-will employment was a jarring concept. In most countries, terminating an employee requires cause, documentation, and often significant severance payments. Employment contracts typically specify notice periods — sometimes months — giving both parties time to plan transitions. At-will employment means your employer can terminate you for any reason (or no reason) at any time, as long as it’s not discriminatory. No advance notice required. No severance guaranteed. One day you’re planning your next sprint, the next day you’re cleaning out your desk. This reality requires a completely different approach to financial and mental planning. You can’t just budget for your monthly expenses, you need to maintain an emergency fund that can cover 6+ months of unemployment. You can’t get too comfortable or assume job security based on performance alone. You need to constantly network, keep your resume updated, and maintain relationships outside your current company. Here’s where at-will employment creates a perverse incentive structure that helps explain Microsoft’s recent layoff approach. While you can fire someone for any reason, firing individual employees for performance still carries significant legal risk and administrative burden. To fire someone for performance, managers must document everything meticulously. Every missed deadline, every subpar deliverable, every coaching conversation needs to be recorded. HR requires a paper trail that can withstand legal scrutiny. This process can take months or even years, during which the underperforming employee continues to collect their salary and potentially drag down team morale. The legal risk is real. Even in at-will states, wrongful termination lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming. Companies worry about discrimination claims, especially if the fired employee belongs to a protected class. Better to have an ironclad documentation trail than face a costly legal battle. Layoffs, paradoxically, are “cleaner.” When you eliminate entire roles or teams, you sidestep the performance documentation requirements. You’re not firing someone for being bad at their job, you’re eliminating the job itself. The legal risk is minimal, and you can even look compassionate by offering severance packages and transition support. Employees can even claim unemployment and keep their income for months! For VPs and executives, layoffs solve multiple problems at once: they can eliminate underperformers without the messy documentation process, reduce headcount to hit financial targets, and maintain the narrative that they’re making “tough but strategic decisions” rather than admitting they failed to manage performance effectively. The bitter irony? Getting laid off is often better for the employee than being fired. Layoffs typically come with severance, extended healthcare, and the ability to say you were “affected by restructuring” rather than “terminated for cause.” You get more time to find your next job, and your professional reputation remains intact. This creates a system where companies find it easier to fire good employees in bulk than to fire bad employees individually. The legal protections meant to prevent arbitrary termination end up enabling exactly that, just at scale. For visa workers, the math is even more stark. When fired for performance, H-1B and other visa holders typically have just 60 days to find new employment or leave the country. But when laid off, they get severance time plus the 60-day grace period, often giving them 3-6 months to secure new sponsorship. For someone whose legal status depends on employment, layoffs are significantly more humane than performance-based termination. The AI efficiency narrative provides the perfect cover for these layoffs. Companies can frame headcount reduction as “leveraging AI to increase productivity” or “optimizing for the future of work.” It sounds forward-thinking and strategic rather than admitting they failed to manage performance or simply want to cut costs. Whether AI actually replaces the laid-off workers’ productivity is rarely measured or proven, but the narrative sells well to investors and the media. The pact is fundamentally broken. Instead, a new pact has been formed: Rather than prescribing what people should do, I think it’s worth understanding the game theory at play. If exceptional performance only nets a negliglible level of improvement while layoff risk remains constant, rational actors might consider: Focus energy strategically. When reward differentiation is minimal, investing extra energy in building external networks and transferable skills may provide better long-term returns than purely internal recognition. Maintain financial cushions. Regardless of performance level, keep emergency funds for unexpected transitions. Keep options open. Whether this means networking, skill development, or periodic market checks depends on your personal risk tolerance and career goals. The optimal approach depends on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and what you value in a career. The Microsoft I joined no longer exists today.. The implicit contract that made lower compensation tolerable — stability and job security — has been broken. What remains is a company that pays below market rate while offering the same job insecurity as anywhere else. For current and prospective Microsoft employees, understanding this new reality is crucial. The company still offers excellent benefits, interesting technical challenges, and the prestige of working at a tech giant. But the days of trading pay for security are over. Would I return to Microsoft knowing what I know now? Maybe. But it would be with a completely different mindset than my first time around. I’d go in understanding that it’s a traditional job with traditional job insecurity, not the stable career haven I once believed it to be. I’d negotiate harder on compensation, knowing there’s no stability premium to justify below-market pay. And I’d never again make the mistake of believing that good performance alone guarantees job security. The Microsoft of today can still be a great place to work, if you go in with realistic expectations and plan accordingly. I want to be clear about something: I’m not bitter about my time at Microsoft. I learned enormously, worked on products used by millions, built lasting relationships, and gained experience that directly contributed to my current success. Microsoft gave me opportunities I’m genuinely grateful for, and I have tremendous respect and admiration for many of the people I worked with there. This analysis isn’t about personal grievances. It’s about a structural shift that affects how people should think about employment decisions. The same way you’d analyze any investment or major life choice, understanding the changing risk/reward profile at Microsoft (or any company) is just rational decision-making. Many people thrive at Microsoft today and will continue to do so. The goal isn’t to discourage anyone from working there, but to help people make informed decisions based on the current reality rather than outdated assumptions about job security.

Title: CEOs Say AI Is Poised to Wipe Out an Astonishing Number of Jobs

Full Content:
Billionaire tech moguls aren't the only ones doomsaying about artificial intelligence layoffs. CEOs across a range of industries are now jumping on the bandwagon, saying it's no longer a matter of "if," but "how many" jobs AI will take. A recent survey by the Wall Street Journal explored just how pervasive the automation idea is throughout a number of industries, and execs aren't pulling any punches. For example, CEO of Ford Motor Company Jim Farley recently predicted that AI "is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the US." He added that "AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind." In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy spooked his employees with a memo saying to expect layoffs in the next few years because of the "once-in-a-lifetime" revolution of AI. And at JPMorgan Chase, CEO Marianne Lake recently told investors to expect the company's overall head count — and therefore its payroll expenses — to fall by as much as 10 percent over the next few years, thanks to the magic of AI. If the AI automation dystopia really is upon us, it evidently slipped under the radar of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which recently released its latest jobs report. Among other things, it found that the US added 147,000 jobs in June, slightly dropping the unemployment rate from 4.2 percent to 4.1 — and seemingly refuting the claim of an impending AI takeover, at least for now. Over half of these jobs, NBC notes, were in state and local government roles, while healthcare, social, service, and construction work made up the bulk of other gains. Still, there are some major issues buried in the data, like the fact that long-term unemployment — people unemployed for six months or more — has skyrocketed from 190,000 to a whopping 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of people unemployed at the median length of unemployment, 15 weeks or more, jumped from 34.9 percent to 38.3 percent. That level hasn't been seen since the throes of the pandemic, NBC notes. While those numbers are bad news — like, really bad — the crisis they point to is a little more complicated than an AI-powered dystopia. At their core, these numbers are arguably the result of our economy's dependence on unemployment laundered through AI hype. As economic researchers Jeffrey Funk and Gary Smith observed in a recent column, revenue from large language model (LLM) adoption is falling far short of the tech industry's promises. What gets presented as proof of AI's automation potential is instead a mash of penny-pinching layoffs, outsourcing, labor market saturation, and in some cases, employer bias against recent college grads. With that view in mind, all the CEO bluster looks less like an imminent crisis brought on by AI, and more like business as usual in a market economy. What workers do about that whole situation is another story altogether.
