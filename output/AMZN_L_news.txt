Title: This 26-year-old’s TikTok-like AI app makes playful, creative short videos from just a few words—it’s built for Gen Z

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI, with AI reporter Sharon Goldman. In this edition…a TikTok-like AI video app that is built for Gen Z…Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom…TSMC profit surges 39% to hit yet another record on AI chip demand…Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Demi Guo, the 27-year-old founder of AI video company Pika, holds degrees in mathematics and computer science. But she’s also always had a creative streak, including writing poetry, and she loves showing off on social media with image and video tools. That’s why she dropped out of her Stanford Ph.D program and co-founded Pika in April 2023 with aspiring animator and fellow Ph.D student Chenlin Meng. Just as AI video companies like Runway were starting to get hot, the duo, after experimenting with making long-form generative AI films, decided to create an easier-to-use AI video generator—sparking interest from top Silicon Valley investors like Nat Friedman. Now, has Pika has raised about $135 million at a $470 million valuation and boasts 16.4 million users across several creative apps. It recently launched a new TikTok-like AI video app, also called Pika, that is already trending, and last week it debuted a new feature in that app called Predictive Video. Unlike other video tools which require long prompts to generate good results, Predictive Video allows users to upload a selfie and say something simple, like “make me a rock star,” or “I’m giving a TED Talk,” or “make me sing in Japanese”; the tool then infers your intent, delivering a complete video with a script, music and dance moves, background, lighting, and camera angles and visual effects. Instead of just producing a standalone video clip, Pika can anticipate motion and interaction, producing a sort of mixed reality by allowing users to weave themselves or real-world elements into AI-generated scenes—something that traditionally would take significant animation skills and production time. All of it is tailor-made for Gen Z and Gen Alpha, cohorts which have grown up on short-form video and uses online platforms to express themselves and share their thoughts, Guo explained. “Most nonprofessionals will never try to create a film using generative AI, but lots of people like to make short videos,” she said. “It’s really about self-expression.” That, she insists, is the opposite of what has become a catch-all tool for AI video: Slop. There may be artificial content at scale, but Pika is meant to, ironically, use generative AI to help people get more real, she says. “We really believe it is not meaningless content,” she emphasized. “It’s about self-expression, the personality is actually real behind it. So a person who is funny will post funny videos, or a person that is very egocentric will post egocentric videos.” Some people like to use one visual effect, or create a video that captures a vibe or a mood, or simply use the tool to do what they wish they could do in real life, she added. “It helps you achieve that in some sense,” she said. “Maybe you are a really bad singer, but in AI, you can sing very well, like a pop star.” Pika is stepping into a competitive landscape dominated by giants like OpenAI’s Sora and Meta’s new Vibes, but it’s carving out a very different niche. Sora is focused on cinematic, photorealistic text-to-video generation, and Vibes is about bringing AI-generated video feeds into Meta’s massive ecosystem. But Pika positions itself closer to the ground-level habits of Gen Z and Gen Alpha: It’s less about polished productions at scale, and more about emotion, creativity and interaction for everyday storytelling. With that, here’s more AI news.

A glimpse into AI’s small, cheap, DIY future – by Sharon Goldman Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say – by Jason Del Rey Challenges renting San Francisco apartments during the AI boom. According to the New York Times, a surge of AI start-ups is reshaping San Francisco’s housing market, driving up demand and prices and intensifying competition for apartments. After his company Cluely raised $5.3 million, 22-year-old founder Roy Lee leased eight luxury apartments just steps from the office to foster a “frat house” work culture—emblematic of how tech firms are reshaping city living. Fueled by growth from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, San Francisco rents have risen 6% in the past year, more than double New York City’s rate, with neighborhoods near A.I. hubs like Mission Bay seeing 13% spikes. The scramble for housing has led renters to tour dozens of units, face same-day rejections, and even bring cash to viewings, raising new concerns about affordability and displacement in one of America’s most expensive cities. TSMC profit surges 39% to beat estimates and hit yet another record on AI chip demand. CNBC reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) posted record third-quarter results as surging demand for artificial intelligence chips fueled a 39.1% jump in profit from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates. Revenue climbed 30.3% to NT$989.92 billion ($33.1 billion), while net income rose to NT$452.3 billion. CEO C.C. Wei said growing consumer adoption of AI models is strengthening the company’s conviction in the “AI megatrend,” prompting TSMC to raise its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and boost planned capacity investments to at least $40 billion. High-performance computing, including AI and 5G chips, accounted for 57% of revenue, and advanced 7-nanometer-and-smaller chips made up 74% of wafer sales, underscoring TSMC’s central role in supplying cutting-edge processors to clients like Nvidia and Apple. Spotify partners with Sony, Universal, Warner and more to develop AI music products. Variety reported that Spotify is teaming up with major music industry players—including Sony, Universal, Warner, Merlin, and Believe—to develop “responsible” AI products aimed at empowering artists and songwriters, marking one of the first large-scale collaborations between streaming and music rights holders on AI. As part of a broader push to invest heavily in AI research and product development, Spotify plans to build a generative AI lab and product team focused on four key goals: creating tools through up-front agreements with labels and publishers; allowing artists and rights holders to opt in to generative music technologies; opening new revenue streams; and strengthening artist-fan connections. The initiative reflects a growing effort across the music industry to shape how AI is integrated into creative and commercial practices. Oct. 21-22: TedAI San Francisco.

That's how many Americans are familiar with AI mental health tools, according to a new YouGov survey that highlights just how far such tools have to go to win over the public. A mere 11% say they’d consider using one, and trust is even lower—just 8% say they trust AI in this space, while 40% explicitly don’t. The top reasons for skepticism: concerns about lack of human nuance (53%), harmful or inaccurate advice (50%), and data privacy (49%). And despite the flood of startups and investment in AI therapy apps, only 4% of Americans have ever tried one. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

As much as 15% of Amazon's HR staff might be cut When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon workers could be facing yet another round of layoffs with as much as 15% of its human resources department at risk, Fortune reports have claimed. Sources confirm that the People eXperience Technology team (Amazon’s HR) is likely to be the hardest hit, but other consumer businesses are also in the firing line. Amazon’s workforce has been steadily decreasing since the end of 2022, with around 27,000 staff being laid off across a range of departments. This is continuing, especially with Amazon recently confirming it expects to cut human workers and replace them with AI. It seems clear that Amazon is reducing its workforce spending in order to prop up the $100 billion spend on data centers and infrastructure to support AI and data processing - pushing the company to a 32% global cloud market share during Q1 of 2025. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who has overseen somr recent dramatic cuts as well as huge data center spending, wrote in a companywide email, also published on Amazon’s corporate blog; “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.” This is part of an industry-wide pattern, with Intel planning to slash around 20% of its workforce, or around 25,000 employees in total. Alongside this, Microsoft let go roughly 9,000 of its staff as it pushes for investment into AI.

Title: Forbes Daily: Luxury Stock Surge Boosts Bernard Arnault’s Fortune

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Luxury fashion saw an investor resurgence on Wednesday, as French conglomerate LVMH reported an increase in quarterly sales growth for the first time this year. The CAC 40, a French stock market index featuring Hermès, Kering and LVMH, among others, closed up nearly 2% on Wednesday. LVMH’s rise also added to chairman Bernard Arnault’s fortune by more than $18 billion. The performance of LVMH, which includes brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Sephora, will “likely set a positive tone for the upcoming luxury reporting season,” analysts said. A positive turnaround for sales in China drove the gains, Reuters reported. Despite ongoing trade tensions, the Chinese government said Apple would boost investment in the country, though it did not provide details on the size of the investment. The company’s CEO Tim Cook made a trip to China this week, even as President Donald Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on the country after it enacted export controls over rare earths. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump Administration from laying off workers during the government shutdown, meaning those employees will have their jobs secured for at least two more weeks. Federal workers’ unions had argued the layoffs were being used as an unlawful pressure tactic against Democrats, and the judge said Wednesday that the government is using the shutdown to “assume all bets are off, the laws don’t apply to them anymore.” As the One Big Beautiful Bill Act limits student loans for parents and graduate students, the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, whose students rely more heavily on federal loans, are bracing for impact. But some billionaires are stepping in and supporting the institutions—including Atlanta Falcons owner and Home Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who this week committed $50 million in scholarships for students at four Atlanta HBCUs. Andy Slavitt left his government job and set out to use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities in 2018 through healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures. Since then, the firm has invested in 35 companies and started seven others. Now, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. A Colorado couple raked in millions in sales for a device that claims to help stop people from choking to death. The Dechoker was marketed as FDA-approved—but the government agency had not only never approved the device, it told the Carvers to stop selling the product entirely in 2023, records show. Anti-choking devices have been shown to be potentially more harmful than helpful, and Amazon began removing the Dechoker and rival unapproved suction devices after Forbes asked the retailer about them. Brown University became the latest institution to reject a deal with the Trump Administration that would have provided special federal funding considerations in exchange for widespread changes to its policies. In a letter to government officials, the school’s president said the deal would “restrict academic freedom” and undermine the autonomy of its governance. The U.S. military is considering land strikes against Venezuelan drug cartels, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday, a potential escalation of the controversial military operations aimed at curbing drug smuggling into the U.S. The president also said he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in the country, and alleged that Venezuela’s top officials have “emptied their prisons into the United States of America.” Inflation and tariff disruptions have had a big impact on the cost of your morning cup of joe, as coffee prices have risen more than 20% since August 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazil and 20% on Vietnam, the two countries that together produce more than half of the world’s coffee beans. For decades, Stanford Health Care had been trying to install a state-of-the-art proton therapy machine to add to its array of high tech cancer treatments. But try as it might, it just couldn’t find a place to put one. Three years ago, Stanford found an alternative: Startup Leo Cancer Care had developed a variation on the standard proton therapy machine design. Instead of rotating the radiation beam around a patient laying flat in a bed, it used a chair in which a seated patient rotated around the beam. That seemingly simple change had transformative consequences. It helped trim the space required for the machine to about 1,700 square feet from more than 29,000 square feet—a more than 90% reduction. That made it significantly less expensive and easier to fit where they wanted it. So Stanford teamed up Leo Cancer Care, which makes the chair and imaging technology, with Mevion Medical Systems, which had developed a small proton accelerator, and in 2024 they started building out the new facility. It’s still early days for Leo Cancer Care, and this is a hard and capital-intensive business. But the company, which has raised a total of $150 million at a valuation of $280 million, including a recent $40 million round led by Catalio Capital Management, is gaining traction. Revenue reached $11 million last year, and is expected to more than double this year. WHY IT MATTERS The number of proton therapy machines in use today is tiny: There are only 46 proton centers in the U.S. and just over 100 worldwide, Leo Cancer Care cofounder and CEO Stephen Towe said, while the global need for them is closer to 2,000. Proton therapy provides greater targeting in cancer treatment, allowing patients to receive effective therapy with less damage to normal tissue and lower radiation risk, but its cost has been prohibitive.

Nestlé layoffs: Switzerland-based fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Nestlé SA is planning to cut 16,000 jobs after its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Philipp Navratil, took charge and vowed to turn the company around. Nestlé SA's move to cut 16,000 jobs represents nearly 6% of the total number of employees working at the FMCG firm. “The world is changing, and Nestlé needs to change faster,” Nestlé CEO Philipp Navratil said in an official statement. “This will include making hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount.” However, the company also announced that a layoff of this scale will be carried out over the next two years, affecting employees working for the KitKat candy bar maker in an effort to save 1 billion Swiss francs in costs. Mint reported earlier that the layoffs include 12,000 white-collar jobs, in addition to the 4,000 job cuts already underway in production and the supply chain. 1. TCS or Tata Consultancy Services: Tata Group's IT arm, Tata Consultancy Services, has already laid off 6,000 employees, which represents 1% of its global headcount. The IT major also plans to cut another 6,000 jobs, bringing the total to 12,000 layoffs, or approximately 2% of its total workforce, as part of the company's restructuring plans amid the push for artificial intelligence (AI) in the industry. 2. Nestlé SA: The FMCG giant plans to cut 16,000 jobs, which amounts to nearly 6% of the company's total workforce. 3. Amazon: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% of job roles in departments, including human resources (People eXperience Technology team), consumer business, among others. 4. Google: Big tech giant reportedly laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 5. Accenture: The tech company in September 2025 announced that they are going to lay off more than 11,000 employees in a company-wide restructuring move. 6. Salesforce: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut the jobs of 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over in the IT and services industry. The company reduced its customer support workforce from 9,000 employees to 5,000 employees, marking 4,000 job cuts. 7. Microsoft: In 2025, Microsoft laid off more than 15,000 employees and around 2,000 more staff who were deemed as underperformers from the big tech firm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a memo, explained how the company has carried out the restructuring based on an objective measure considering the firm's ‘market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right.’ Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: AI stock frenzy sparks bubble fears as valuations skyrocket

Some argue open-source AI could mitigate risks of centralized control and financial instability. A historic surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has Wall Street buzzingâbut also bracing for a potential crash. Nvidia, once a niche chipmaker, now boasts a staggering $4.5 trillion valuation, while OpenAIâs deals with tech giants like Microsoft, AMD and Oracle raise concerns about financial circularity. With industry leaders warning of overinvestment and economists comparing the frenzy to past bubbles, the question looms: Is AI the next dot-com bust waiting to happen? The AI stock surge: Euphoria or excess? Since ChatGPTâs 2022 debut, AI has dominated markets. Nvidiaâs chips power the AI revolution, fueling its meteoric rise. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta have also seen explosive growth, collectively driving 80% of S&P 500 gains. Oracleâs stock soared 40% in a single day after securing OpenAI contractsâa sign of investor euphoria. But skepticism mounts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited," while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warns of an "industrial bubble." Bank of England analysts caution that markets are "exposed" if AI optimism falters. The parallels to the late-1990s dot-com bubbleâwhen vendor financing inflated valuations before a brutal crashâare hard to ignore. Circular deals and financial engineering Recent AI financing arrangements have drawn scrutiny for their self-reinforcing nature: Nvidia invests $100B in OpenAI, which then builds data centers using Nvidia chips. OpenAI buys AMD chips, taking a potential 10% stake in the company. Microsoft funds OpenAI while also relying on Nvidia-powered cloud services. Critics call this "vendor financing"âa tactic used during the dot-com bubble to artificially inflate demand. Goldman Sachs acknowledges "elements of investor behavior" mirror past bubbles but argues todayâs AI boom is backed by real profitsâfor now. The bubble debate: Optimism vs. caution Proponents insist AIâs transformative potential justifies the spending. OpenAIâs revenue growth is unprecedented, and Altman argues the industry is still undervalued. Federal Reserve officials even suggest this could be a "good bubble," driving innovation despite financial risks. Yet MIT research found that 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver returns, despite $30â40B in spending. Venture capitalist Alan Patricof warns, "The losses will be pretty significant." Meanwhile, AIâs impact on jobs remains uncertainâAnthropicâs CEO predicts mass white-collar layoffs, while McKinsey sees AI as a productivity booster, not a replacement. The road ahead: Crash or correction? Three scenarios could burst the AI bubble: Concentration risk: If OpenAI or Nvidia stumble, a domino effect could destabilize the sector. Governance failures: Poor oversight (like FTXâs collapse) could trigger regulatory crackdowns. Technological disruption: Quantum computing breakthroughs could render current AI infrastructure obsolete. Despite warnings, AIâs momentum shows no signs of slowing. The question isnât if but when reality catches upâand whether the fallout will be a minor correction or a catastrophic crash. A bubble with a fifference? Unlike the dot-com era, todayâs AI investments are fueled by trillion-dollar tech giants with vast cash reservesânot speculative startups. Yet history suggests unchecked exuberance rarely ends well. Whether AI reshapes the economy or becomes the next speculative bust, one truth remains: Investors should tread carefully. The bubble may not have burst yetâbut the warning signs are flashing. Keep up with the latest at MarketCrash.news and Glitch.news.

Nvidiaâs chips power the AI revolution, fueling its meteoric rise. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta have also seen explosive growth, collectively driving 80% of S&P 500 gains. Oracleâs stock soared 40% in a single day after securing OpenAI contractsâa sign of investor euphoria. But skepticism mounts. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admits investors are "overexcited," while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warns of an "industrial bubble."

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kent Ha, a 37-year-old job seeker in Portland, Oregon, who previously worked as a digital marketing strategist at Intel. He holds a bachelor's degree in new media communications from Oregon State University and an MBA from George Fox University with a concentration in leadership and management. He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe — getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 — once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment — and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan — that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching — and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers — and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs — but what actually worked was posting my résumé on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams — for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my résumé — with help from ChatGPT — to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in — she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard — I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity — that's what keeps me going.

Title: Tech Workers Versus Enshittification

Full Content:
The men who appeared on the dais behind President Trump at his inauguration were never good men. Take Tim Cook. Cook owes his elevation to Apple CEO—which made him a billionaire twice over—to his leadership in moving Apple manufacturing to “iPhone City” in south China.3 Other Apple execs had tried this, but they could never get the precision and reliability Apple demanded. Cook managed it, but the brutal working conditions created by Foxconn, Apple’s contract manufacturer there, led to the installation of suicide nets5 to catch workers who leapt to their death rather than facing another shift. Or look at Jeff Bezos. Workers in Bezos’s warehouses are injured (often critically) at three times the rate of workers in other companies’ warehouses.7 Bezos’s contract drivers have to relieve themselves in bottles because they are not given toilet breaks. They are also monitored by AI cameras that score their eyeball movements.11 Google’s top bosses covered up for a senior manager who allegedly preyed on a female subordinate, whom he subjected to violent sex acts. He was given millions of dollars to go away quietly12 while his victim was prohibited from suing by the “binding arbitration” waivers in her contract. These men have always abused anyone they could get away with abusing. If they seemed to treat some people well—for example, the pampered coders who get gourmet cafeterias, free massages, and all the kombucha they can drink—it was because they feared the difficulties of replacing those workers. Now that U.S. Big Tech has shed more than 400,000 jobs in just two years, there’s a reserve army of desperate techies who can be given the suicide-net-and-urine-bottle treatment. One of the first official acts of the current administration was to cancel every single labor investigation and enforcement action in the entire country.8 The administration’s antitrust boss canceled investigations into predatory pricing (selling goods below cost to drive out competitors) and surveillance pricing (using commercial surveillance data to charge you more (for example, by increasing the price of your breakfast sandwich on payday) or pay you less (for example, offering nurses lower wages if they are known to have overdue credit card bills).10 Instead of helping workers and shoppers resist predatory assaults fueled and perpetrated by Big Tech, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission chair is focusing all his energies on a new snitch line where FTC employees can report “wokeism.”4 The men who run Big Tech have always wanted to “enshittify” their services—to shift as much as they can from users, workers, suppliers, and business customers to themselves. The forces that prevented that—militant, scarce workers; competitors; regulators; and rival technologies—were critically weakened and even eliminated over the past 40 years. Biden’s administration was the first in two generations to take fighting corporate abuses seriously.1 Is it any wonder that Big Tech were all in for his rival? Enshittification would be much, much worse if not for tech workers. Tech workers have historically enjoyed remarkable workplace status—not just the material perks, from dry cleaning to personal trainers, but also the power to tell their bosses to go to hell. When your skills are in such high demand that you can quit your job, walk across the street, and get a better one later that same day, your boss has a real incentive to make you feel like you are their social equal, empowered to say and do whatever feels technically right, or just, you know, show up for work with facial piercings, a green mohawk, and a black t-shirt from Defcon with writing on it that your boss doesn’t understand but still feels uncomfortable about. Tech workers may have given their bosses tsuris and demanded sky-high wages, but at least they were wildly productive. The per-worker revenue for successful tech companies is unfathomable—tens or even hundreds of times their wages and stock compensation packages.2 What’s more, many tech businesses had more work than they could hire skilled workers to perform, so bosses’ strategy focused on getting the workers they could hire to put in longer hours. That strategy has a name: “vocational awe,” a term coined by the librarian-theorist Fobazi Ettarh to describe the grueling hours endured by workers who believe in the social value of their work. Teachers, nurses, librarians—any profession whose practitioners are motivated by a sense of duty is a profession vulnerable to vocational awe. Tech companies have been widely derided for their grandiose mission statements, such as Google’s “organize all the world’s information and make it useful” or Facebook’s “making the world more open and connected.” But whether the management of these companies believed in these high-minded words, they were absolutely internalized by employees, who—despite their job security—worked every hour god sent, sleeping under their desks and missing their parents’ funerals to hit their bosses’ arbitrary deadlines. As a motivational tactic, vocational awe (or, as Elon Musk puts it, “being extremely hardcore”) works very well, but it fails very badly. It turns out that when you actually care about your job, and when your boss can’t replace you, and when you can get a new job whenever you want, it’s damned hard to convince you to wreck the things you built and harm your users, even if that will make your boss more money. For many years, tech workers have been the last line of defense between Internet users and tech bosses, bravely holding the line on enshittification. But once tech started to shed workers en masse—260,000 layoffs in 2023,6 another 160,000 in 20249—the power of workers was shattered. Scarcity can give workers power, but scarcity is temporary: Eventually, enough people train to work in your industry, or your boss figures out how to outsource your job to overseas workers with fewer protections and rights, and your power is shattered. No wonder tech bosses are so excited about AI coding tools, which promise to turn skilled programmers from creative problem-solvers to mere code reviewers for AI as it produces tech debt at scale. Code reviewers never tell their bosses to go to hell, and they are a lot easier to replace. Now that tech workers are as disposable as Amazon warehouse workers and drivers, as disposable as the factory workers in iPhone City, it’s only a matter of time until the job conditions are harmonized downward. Jeff Bezos doesn’t force his delivery drivers to relieve themselves in bottles because he hates delivery drivers. Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow his coders to use a restroom whenever they need to because he loves hackers. The factor that determines how Jeff Bezos treats workers is “What is the worst treatment those workers can be forced to accept?” Throughout the entire history of human civilization, there has only ever been one way to guarantee fair wages and decent conditions for workers: unions. Even non-union workers benefit from unions, because strong unions are the force that causes labor protection laws to be passed, which protect all workers. Tech workers have historically been monumentally uninterested in unionization, and it’s not hard to see why. Why go to all those meetings and pay those dues when you could tell your boss to go to hell on Tuesday and have a new job by Wednesday? That’s not the case anymore. It will likely never be the case again. Interest in tech unions is at an all-time high. Groups such as Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition are doing a land-office business, and copies of Ethan Marcotte’s You Deserve a Tech Union are flying off the shelves. Now is the time to get organized. Your boss has made it clear how you’d be treated if they had their way. They’re about to get it. Walking a picket line is a slog, to be sure, but picket lines beat piss bottles, hands down.

In this week’s edition of InnovationRx, we look at the Khosla Ventures-Cleveland Clinic partnership, Town Hall Ventures’ $440 million haul, the CDC’s “Friday night massacre,” Boehringer’s new pulmonary fibrosis drug, and more. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. New technologies are transforming the way that hospitals operate. To try and gain an edge, Khosla Ventures and Cleveland Clinic signed a deal in which the health system will test new technologies that span AI, digital health and next-generation therapeutics from the VC firm’s portfolio companies—and the two will explore opportunities to incubate new companies together. “I think this is a novel approach,” Hal Paz, Khosla Ventures’ operating partner, told Forbes. Discussions that led to the agreement, announced at Cleveland Clinic’s Life Sciences Summit in London on Tuesday, had been in the works for a year. The storied VC firm, with $17 billion in assets under management and more than 300 portfolio companies (about one-third of them in healthcare), gains a substantial healthcare partner with whom to test new technologies from clinical validation through adoption, that may also become a valuable customer for the companies it’s invested in. Meanwhile, Cleveland Clinic, the highly-regarded non-profit health system that spans 23 hospitals and 280 outpatient facilities, gets access to a pipeline of emerging technologies that could help it improve care and efficiency. Already, some 10 to 12 of Khosla’s portfolio companies, mostly in AI and digital health, are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic about how they could work with the health system, Paz said. One, Vista AI, which has developed AI to automate and simplify cardiac MRIs, is already working with Cleveland Clinic at its Akron hospital. Vista’s software enables more scans to be done on a single machine with improved quality and consistency. The two are also already working on a first startup incubation, though neither the final idea nor the timing of its launch has been set. “We are at an inflection point in the industry,” said JD Friedland, Cleveland Clinic’s executive director of venture. “New transformational technologies are emerging that we believe are going to fundamentally address some of the perpetual challenges in healthcare.” The agreement comes as tech-based venture firms have increasingly viewed healthcare as an area of opportunity and as hospitals and health systems have been testing how technology could improve patient care, reduce physician burnout and increase razor-thin margins. It also follows a move by General Catalyst to acquire health system Summa Health, a $515 million deal that created the first hospital system to be owned by a VC firm. “I bet the more significant venture investors in healthcare are going to find different ways to get access to that clinical and research expertise,” Cleveland Clinic’s Friedland said. “It certainly costs a lot less money to partner with Cleveland Clinic than to buy a hospital, and it comes with less strings attached and less brain damage.” For both Khosla and Cleveland Clinic, their non-exclusive partnership could be the first of multiple collaborations—but both Paz and Friedland stressed there was much to do first. Said Paz: “Before we get over our skis and think about the second health system to partner with and the third, we need to give this a little time and learn from it.” When Andy Slavitt left government, he wanted to prove that you could use technology to improve healthcare for underserved and low-income communities—and still make a profit. The former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and overseer of the successful turnaround of healthcare.gov, set up healthcare-focused VC firm Town Hall Ventures in the summer of 2018 to do just that. “I’ve got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,” he told Forbes. “If [investors] think you are impact, they’ll put you in this bucket—people who do nice things and maybe some nice family office wants to invest in you because they’ve got an impact mandate. I have always resisted that.” Since its launch seven years ago, Town Hall Ventures has invested in 35 companies and started seven others, including kidney care specialist Strive and Suvida, which offers primary care focused on Hispanic seniors and their families. Its first fund posted top-decile performance, with a net internal rate of return from its July 2018 inception (thru June 30) of 33% versus 12% for the median VC fund. A total of 10 its bets surpassed a billion-dollar valuation, including Cityblock Health, a healthcare provider focused on low-income communities that was one of its initial investments and has since reached a valuation of $6.2 billion; SignifyHealth, a provider of tech-enabled at-home risk assessment acquired by CVS for $8 billion in 2023; and Landmark Health, a startup offering in-home medical care to patients with chronic conditions purchased by Optum Health for $3.5 billion in 2021. Buoyed by that track record, Town Hall Ventures told Forbes it has now raised $440 million for a fourth fund, bringing its total assets under management to $1.4 billion. While the New York-based firm, whose general partners consist of Slavitt, David Whelan and Meera Mani, remains small compared to venture capital giants like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst or Sequoia, each of which has tens of billions in assets under management, it’s a well-regarded player in healthcare. Read more here. Boehringer Ingelheim gained FDA approval for the first new treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in a decade with its drug Jascayd, a twice-daily pill. Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease in which scarring on the lungs makes it increasingly difficult to breathe. Martin Beck, head of Boehringer’s inflammation disease area, told trade publication Fierce Pharma that the drug represented a major shift forward in treating a disease that had been a “graveyard of clinical development” with more than 36 failed trials over the past decade. Jascayd blocks a type of enzyme, called PDE4B, that’s involved in the honeycomb-patterned lung scarring and inflammation associated with the disease. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that it slowed patients’ decline in lung function compared to a placebo over the course of a year. Plus: Obesity startup Kailera Therapeutics raised $600 million, led by Bain Capital Private Equity, to start Phase III trials of its lead drug candidate, an injectable GLP-1 drug similar to Lilly’s Zepbound. The size of the round ties it with Isomorphic Labs for the largest biotech fundraise of the year. Forbes profiled Kailera earlier this year. Kailera was worth $1.5 billion before the new funding; its new valuation was not disclosed. Duos, a digital health company focused on seniors, raised $130 million, led by FTV Capital, at an undisclosed valuation. The two-year-old company helps members enroll in government programs, retain Medicaid coverage and figure out benefits they may be eligible for but aren’t using. Plus: Umar Afridi, a pharmacist who previously cofounded Truepill, raised $20 million to bring AI to pharmacy operations with Foundation Health. Truepill was acquired by LetsGetChecked for $525 million last year. Digital Health-focused VC firm Define Ventures led the funding round. Biotech startup Immusoft safely re-dosed a patient with its experimental gene therapy for progressive genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I that causes skeletal abnormalities, heart disease and vision loss. The company’s gene therapy makes use of engineered B-cells, which the body typically uses to make antibodies, to make specific proteins that treat diseases instead. The benefit of the approach is that it doesn’t require immunosuppression or chemotherapy as other gene therapies do. The ability to safely re-dose makes the therapy more long-lasting, which had been a question during its clinical trial. Forbes spoke with CEO Sean Ainsworth about the company’s technology earlier this year. Plus: Johnson & Johnson is spinning off its orthopedics business, which generated $9.2 billion in revenue in 2024. The new company, called DePuy Synthes, is expected to launch in 2027. Last Friday, around 1,300 CDC employees received notices that they’d been laid off with no warning. Over the weekend, more than half appear to have been told their firing was rescinded, though some 600 employees still appear to remain fired, according to the National Public Health Coalition, an organization of former CDC employees. So far, many of the departments hit appear to be core to the agency’s work, including the CDC library, which provides access to crucial scientific data for agency scientists; the agency’s entire Washington office, which provides information and support to Congress, the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and staff focused on data collection and disease surveillance. The Health and Human Services Department blamed the layoffs on the current government shutdown and said that employees laid off had been declared non-essential. This is one of several waves of layoffs that have eliminated around 25% of the CDC’s staff since Trump took office. The American Federation of Government Employees has sued the Trump Administration, challenging the legality of layoffs during a government shutdown. In a lawsuit over a previous round of layoffs, a federal judge found that the Administration’s firing of CDC staff was likely unlawful. “Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump Administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” John Brooks, former chief medical officer for CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, told reporters at an National Public Health Coalition press conference on Tuesday. In response these ongoing program cuts, the Wall Street Journal reported today that 15 states, all with Democratic governors, are building an alliance to manage public health threats. The states have agreed that they will “help one another prepare for pandemics, track infectious diseases, write public-health guidelines, share expertise on preventive care and buy vaccines and supplies in bulk.” Novo Nordisk agreed to acquire Akero Therapeutics for up to $5.2 billion for its experimental liver disease treatment. San Francisco-based Akero has been testing its drug, efruxifermin, as a treatment for MASH, which causes fat to build up on the liver, leading to fibrosis. The deal follows Roche’s announcement last month that it was buying 89bio for $3.5 billion for its experimental MASH drug. Amazon sellers made millions from banned “Dechoker” medical devices, according to the FDA. Biotech dealmaking, from M&A to venture investments, ticked up in the third quarter. Political pressures are influencing work at FDA, according to career staffers there. Consumer Reports found that some protein shakes and powders contain extremely high levels of lead. Mixtures of common drugs that wind up in waterways may accelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria, according to research led by the University of Exeter. Wearable health company Oura raised $900 million led by Fidelity, bringing its valuation to $11 billion. That’s more than double the $5.2 billion it was worth last December. The United Nations World Food Programme warned that nearly 14 million people faced severe hunger due to cuts in global aid, especially from the Trump Administration.

Amazon is reportedly planning significant layoffs, targeting about 15% of its human resources staff and potentially impacting other departments. This move aligns with the tech giant's strategy to invest heavily in artificial intelligence while reducing employee costs. CEO Andy Jassy has previously indicated that AI adoption will lead to workforce reductions as the company seeks efficiency gains.

Title: Amazon plans layoffs: From Accenture to TCS, these companies have handed pink slips to employees this year

Amazon plans layoffs: Global e-commerce giant Amazon is planning to cut nearly 15% job roles in its human resources department, along with certain other roles, Fortune reported on Wednesday, 15 October 2025. According to the news portal's report, Amazon's HR department, also known as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, will bear the majority of the cuts, while other departments, such as the consumer business, may also experience some impact. Amazon's HR department has more than 10,000 people employed globally. The company is reportedly laying off staff as the e-commerce giant aims to reduce its employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure. Big IT companies such as TCS, Accenture, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are among other firms that have carried out restructuring to improve efficiency and reduce costs amid the rise of AI. TCS is cutting nearly 12,000 employees, or around 2% of its global workforce, in the financial year 2025-26, amid restructuring plans and a push for AI expansion. In the case of Wipro, although there is no official confirmation of layoffs, media reports suggest that the IT major has cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Global IT services giant Accenture announced in September 2025 that it would lay off more than 11,000 employees across its global workforce, while Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has cut 4,000 customer support staff as AI tools take over. Salesforce reportedly reduced its customer support workforce to 5,000 employees, down from its earlier 9,000 employees, marking a reduction of approximately 4,000 employees. 1. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — Laid off 6,000 employees or 1% of its headcount. It will lay off another 6,000 employees to cut a total of 12,000 jobs or 2% of its total workforce. 2. Google — Laid off 100 employees in design-related roles. 3. Accenture — To lay off 11,000 employees across its global workforce. 4. Salesforce — Cut nearly 4,000 customer support staff. 5. Microsoft — Cut more than 40% or nearly 4,000 jobs in its software engineering business. 6. IBM — Cut nearly 1,000 job roles as the firm shifted to its hybrid cloud and AI business. 7. Cognizant — Laid off 3,500 employees in an effort to simplify the organisation's structure. 8. Wipro — Cut 24,516 jobs to improve its cost efficiency and productivity in the sector. Many tech companies around the world are facing challenges due to pressure from their US business and recent concerns about US President Donald Trump's proposed increase in the H-1B visa fee. Jobs are at risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which some companies might prefer to boost productivity and efficiency over that of the human workforce.

Title: 4 New AI Jobs That Pay Up To $200,000+ In 2026
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/10/15/4-new-ai-jobs-that-pay-up-to-200000-in-2026/

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. We hear a lot about AI disrupting the workforce and making millions of jobs obsolete. We’ve seen AI-related layoffs last year and this year, with plans being drawn up for more layoffs at large companies like Amazon. But what roles is artificial intelligence actually creating? What are the new jobs of the future, the roles that will be in high demand in 2026 and beyond? In this article, you’ll learn about four AI jobs that you’ve probably never heard of, which offer eye-watering lucrative salaries of up to $200,000 and above. These will be the hot jobs of 2026 and will continue to grow in demand as AI implementation is rolled out across organizations. Keep reading to discover what these AI jobs are, the responsibilities involved, and how much they pay: This is the hottest new addition to the C-suite in 2025 and will continue to rise in demand in 2026. According to Asana’s Global State of AI at Work report, companies that have experienced the most success in terms of ROI and productivity when it comes to rolling out AI across their organizations, have designated roles in place, and have a strong strategy, treating it as a business-critical resource (82%). Part of this strategy involves having someone dedicated to AI implementation, digital transformation, and AI ethics and policy in the organization. This has carved the way for this new role, Chief AI Officer, who sits at the executive level and oversees all things AI implementation and strategy. Because this role, and many of the others listed below, are fairly new, we still don’t have access to broad numbers of salary data. However, based on the available information from salary comparison sites such as ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and analyzing job listings, here is what you can expect as an average pay rate in the U.S.: Average salary: $259,502 (some companies offer eye-watering pay packages in excess of $1 million) As a generative AI content expert, you would be optimizing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), by creating high-quality training data, using your own judgment to close gaps of information, and using your creativity to train AI models that produce the best outputs. An AI content expert or strategist’s job title can also refer to using AI tools to create and deliver a content schedule on behalf of a business, using your eye for detail to tweak the output and ensure accuracy while maintaining the company’s voice. Because this title is used to mean different responsibilities, take time to thoroughly review the job description before applying, so you know what you’re getting into. This role is best suited for professionals with extensive writing experience and a strong grasp on grammar, original creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. Having STEM background may also be preferred by some employers. Average salary: $55,000 to $90,000+ (there aren’t many advertized salaries in this field yet) An applied AI engineer builds, develops, and deploys customized AI solutions for a business to use internally and for their clients. Many of these roles are associated with building and deploying AI agents, which are the buzzword in workplaces right now. These customized solutions enable a business to implement AI and work at scale, using artificial intelligence in a way that best works for their needs, rendering them more effective when it comes to AI integration, or AI scalers, as Asana's State of AI report refers to them. As an example of what you’d be expected to deliver in this role, a job posting by The General Intelligence Company of New York says: When describing what they’d look for in their ideal Applied AI Agent Engineer candidate, the job posting says: Average salary: $154,442 When AI is being rolled out in an organization, there has to be guardrails in place. Otherwise, the company can incur great risk. One thing Asana’s report noted is that AI infrastructure requires three Ps: policy, psychological safety, and performance. The first P, policy, is where an AI ethics lead comes in. You’ll be responsible for “developing clear frameworks that provide guardrails without bureaucracy, defining who does what, when AI is appropriate, and how quality gets maintained.” This ensures safe practices for users as well as those on the receiving end of the output. As an example, OpenAI is currently hiring for a software engineer for AI safety, and the salary on offer is $210,000 – $325,000 plus equity. Average salary: $242,471 To succeed in these roles and land lucrative, niche, AI jobs, here’s what you need to start doing now: Keep upskilling and make your skills niche and relevant. Focus on ways that you can provide direct financial value and translate your technical expertise to niche business solutions. This is what enterprises are looking for. Constantly update and share your portfolio on LinkedIn. Then, monetize your expertise by teaching it online or by selling your projects. Finally, learn how to make your skills marketable so that you can catch the attention of employers and high-caliber clients.

Δ Those cuts could include up to 15% of the tech giant’s human resources (HR) staff, Fortune reported late Tuesday (Oct. 14), citing multiple sources familiar with the plans. Aside from HR, other areas of the company’s consumer business are also likely to be affected, two of the sources said. The Fortune report notes that the cuts are happening at a time when Amazon is seeking ways to reduce employee costs while spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) products and infrastructure for in-house use and as an enterprise offering. Amazon has said it aims to spend more than $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it expands its cloud and AI datacenters. This follows a series of layoffs in other parts of the company earlier this year, including consumer devices unit, the Wondery podcast arm, and in Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the time, Amazon noted that it was still hiring throughout the company, including AWS roles. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue While those layoffs came soon after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that artificial intelligence (AI) would lead to job cuts, the company stressed to PYMNTS at the time that these cuts were not connected to AI, but instead followed a review of areas that could be streamlined. PYMNTS has reached out to Amazon for comment about this latest round of cuts, but has not yet gotten a reply. Jassy in June sent a message to Amazon workers saying that employees who have learned to use AI will be in a better position to be a part of the company. He added that Amazon’s corporate workforce would likely shrink in the next few years as the company embraces AI, calling it the most transformative technology since the advent of the internet. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message. Research from PYMNTS Intelligence, from the report “Workers Say Fears About GenAI Taking Their Jobs Is Overblown,” found that more than half (54%) of workers said that generative AI posed a “significant risk of widespread job displacement.” The study also found that 38% of workers said they were worried the technology could eventually lead to their jobs being eliminated.

Title: Exclusive: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on AI, gold, tariffs, and crypto

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. I wasn’t surprised to see JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on stage yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit. I’ve interviewed several women leaders over the years—TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett, Travelers Chief Marketing Officer Lisa Caputo, Mary Callahan Erdoes, who runs JPMorgan Chase’s Asset & Wealth Management, and veteran finance executive Heidi Miller, among others—who consider Dimon an important mentor. Women make up half of JPMorgan’s board and seven of the 13 members of its operating committee. Dimon spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about topics ranging from AI to blockchain, which you can read about here and here. Fresh from reporting a banner quarter, the bank chief expounded on AI, gold, regulation, jobs, tariffs, debt, government waste, New York’s mayoral race, and “the need to keep the Western world together economically.” You can check out the full interview here. And here’s what I’ve gleaned from attendees, when it comes to Dimon’s mentorship approach: Bet on Winners: Dimon helps people who’ve earned his respect and trust, whether it’s hiring people like Miller at multiple companies or advising Duckett during her inaugural year as CEO of TIAA. That instinct isn’t limited to women: Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf comes to mind. Dimon says he’s guided by performance, not gender or loyalty. To do otherwise, in his view, is a disservice to the team. Share your network: Lisa Caputo met Dimon after he’d been fired from Citigroup and she had just arrived there. As she put it yesterday: “I was trying to build a women’s business from scratch. Every time Jamie would call, he would give me the names of three people to talk to inside the company, and he would also ask me what I’d learned so far. Through my conversations with him, he was literally helping me shape what the business model could look like.” Go Beyond Borders: Anyone who launches a $1.5 trillion initiative is seeking a purpose beyond their own company. After almost two decades as CEO, Dimon expects ambitious people may leave. Part of his job is to help good people become better leaders wherever they go. The world needs more of them. Relationships matter. And having friends in far places helps a leader learn.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Why the U.S. Supreme Court might keep Trump’s tariffs On their face, President Trump’s trade tariffs are illegal because Congress did not approve them and because routine trade is not the “emergency” that Trump claims. But the U.S. Supreme Court may rule to leave them in place anyway because of the logistical difficulty of undoing them, according to former Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. “The government is coming to court and saying, ‘We would have to unwind billions or trillions of dollars. It could bankrupt our nation,’” she said. Trump considers cooking oil ban for China “I believe that China purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an Economically Hostile Act. We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution. As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don’t need to purchase it from China,” the president said on Truth Social. Investors took it as a signal that there would be no immediate compromise in the trade war, sending the S&P 500 down 0.16% on the day. Trump preps list of programs he will eliminate The U.S. government shutdown shows no sign of coming to an end. Yesterday the president said he was drawing up a list of “egregious socialist, semi-communist” government programs that he would eliminate permanently if Democrats in Congress don’t help him pass his spending bill. “We're closing up programs ... that we wanted to close up or that we never wanted to happen,” Trump said. “We're not going to let them come back.” Dimon issues private credit warning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more” JPMorgan Chase wrote off $170 million in debt it was owed in the collapse of auto parts supply company First Brands, the company reported in its Q3 earnings call, and JPM CEO Jamie Dimon warned there may be more cracks in the private credit markets to come: “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” Apollo Global Management chief Marc Rowan also warned of “late-cycle accidents” but Blackstone president Jonathan Gray said it was not a systemic problem. Powell hints at further rate cuts In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the institution is likely to cut rates again as a weak job market trumps inflation concerns. Policy changes may need to “take another step toward a more neutral stance,” Powell said at the National Association for Business Economics. Amazon is preparing a new round of layoffs Amazon is planning to lay off as much as 15% of the company’s human resources staff, according to sources familiar with the situation, with other departments likely to be affected as well. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment on the situation.

Title: Amazon likely to cut 15% jobs in new round of AI-driven layoffs: Report
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazon-new-round-of-ai-driven-layoffs-report-10308167/

Amazon is looking to eliminate 15 per cent of jobs from its human resources division even as the tech giant continues to aggressively invest in developing AI products and infrastructure. Internally referred to as the People Experience Technology (PXT) team, the HR division at Amazon comprises over 10,000 employees across the world, including a recruiting team, technology staff, and other HR-related roles. The upcoming round of layoffs at Amazon is expected to impact the PXT team hardest, according to a report by Fortune. Employees in other divisions involving Amazon’s core consumer business could also be affected by the layoffs, the report said. The exact number of employees that will be let go and when the layoffs are expected to happen is still unclear. The latest round of job cuts at Amazon comes amid a deteriorating job market for those in the tech sector, with several big tech companies looking to leverage AI tools in order to shrink headcounts and lower costs. While many AI-related layoffs are being framed as ‘restructuring’ efforts, big tech firms are simultaneously ramping up investments in data centres and compute to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Amazon, for instance, has earmarked over $100 billion in capital expenditures this year to build out its cloud and AI data centres. In June this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had announced in a memo to its 1.5 million employees that, as the company embraces AI tools across the organisation, it will ultimately “reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains” over time. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy added that generative AI will ‘change the way our work is done,’ and said the company will eventually ‘need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.’ “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he further said. Taking over as CEO from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, Jassy oversaw the largest layoffs in the company’s history roughly two years ago, when Amazon cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs. Earlier this year, Amazon also laid off employees in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant also announced this week that it will be hiring over 2,50,000 seasonal employees across its warehouses and logistics networks in the US ahead of the holiday season. India has strongly condemned Pakistan’s recent military actions along the Afghan border, accusing Islamabad of sheltering and sponsoring terrorist organisations amid escalating tensions between the two neighbours. At a press briefing on Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also underlined New Delhi’s support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and independence.

Amazon layoff news: E-commerce and tech giant Amazon is set to slash as much as 15 per cent roles in its human resources department, besides some other roles, in a new round of layoffs, Fortune reported citing sources. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to respond, it added. While it is expected that Amazon's HR team, known internally as the People eXperience Technology team or PTX, which has over 10,000 staff globally, will take the most cuts, other core consumer business departments could also see some impact, two sources told the publication. As per the report, these job cuts come as the giant looks to reduce employee costs amid heavy investment in artificial intelligence products and AI infrastructure. Amazon has stated it aims to spend over $100 billion capex in 2025 to build its AI data centres and cloud computing centres. These will be for sale to customers and for internal use, the report added. From late 2022 into 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy signed off on at least 27,000 job cuts at Amazon — largely from its corporate offices. The period saw many large tech companies, including Meta and Google, slashing jobs. In June, Andy Jassy in a company memo stressed the importance of AI adoption to employees. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote. “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” he added. Amazon.com Inc. plans to hire 2,50,000 workers during its peak holiday season in full-time, part-time and seasonal roles. The company in a statement said that temporary workers will earn $19 per hour on average, and permanent roles will pay $23 per hour on average. The 2,50,000 workers on holiday hire is unchanged from the previous two years, a Bloomberg report noted.

Title: Amazon Plans To Reduce 15% Human Resources Staff, Fortune Reports

Amazon is planning to cut human resources staff by 15%, Fortune reported, citing sources. People eXperience Technology Team, human resource department of the company, will be the worst hit in the move. Core consumer business will probably to be affected by the move as well. Fortune's report did not mention how many number of employees, and when they will be laid off. Amazon's PXT division has more than 10,000 employees worldwide. The team includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional human resource roles, the report said. Compared to other companies, Amazon has laid off a relatively small number of people early this year. The layoffs happened in its consumer devices unit, Wondery podcast division, and in the Amazon web series. The company is looking for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in artificial intelligence products and infrastructure. Amazon intends to increase the use of AI for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers, Fortune said. Amazon has planned to spend upwards of $100 billion capital expenditure this year as it builds its cloud and AI data centres, according to the report. Meanwhile, Amazon will likely add 250,000 to its workforce during its peak season, Bloomberg reported. The aggressive hiring during holiday season makes the company a standout in an otherwise bleak holiday labour market. Amazon will hire for full-time, part-time, and season roles with temporary workers earning an average of $19 per hour, Bloomberg reported, citing a statement from Amazon. Pay for permanent roles averages $23 per hour. US shoppers will likely spend $253.4 billion on online shopping during November and December, which indicates a 5.3% upside from 2024, according to Adobe Inc. However, shoppers are also planning to curb overall holiday spending because of tariff-related price increases and a weakening labour market, according to a survey released in September by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Amazon is planning a new wave of layoffs, sources say

Jason Del Rey is a technology correspondent at Fortune and a co-chair of the Fortune Brainstorm Tech and Fortune Brainstorm AI conferences. Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. Two sources told Fortune that Amazon’s human resources division—known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team—will be hard-hit, but that other areas of Amazon’s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn’t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts. The company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon’s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles. The new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure—both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to devote upwards of $100 billion to capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI data centers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high-single-digit percentage of the company’s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI—initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs—to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon’s corporate blog. At the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won’t be room on the bus for everyone: “We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA—essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be okay losing, whether through voluntary departures, being “managed out,” or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed in a different way internally than the typical URA process. While Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its usual holiday hiring spree of warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its U.S. warehouse and logistics networks. Amazon’s stock price is down a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.

Title: Holiday hiring forecast to fall to 16-year low as tariffs force retail pullback
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/tariffs-trump-holiday-hiring-shopping-inflation-shrinks-retailers/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T15:12:46Z
Full Content:
Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago. Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. “We are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they’re making to their workforce.” In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy’s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started. The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before. Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. “Radial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.” So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target said it’s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool. Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

JD Vance appeared on multiple Sunday shows this week. He was as charming, we mean off-putting and repellent, as ever. Let’s dive in! Beginning chronologically, Vance went on NBC to try his luck with Kristen Welker. If Vance was trying to prove he isn’t a sycophant, he failed almost immediately when he started by trying to chastise NBC News for not adequately praising King “MAGAbicho”: VANCE: But I also have to give your network a little bit of grief, Kristen, because last night I was watching NBC. They […] mentioned that during a rally last night in Israel, when Steve Witkoff, our great special envoy, mentioned Bibi Netanyahu the crowd booed. But the broadcast didn’t mention that when Steve Witkoff mentioned President Trump, the crowd actually cheered. And why is that, Kristen? Yes, and why didn’t the Nobel Committee make a one-time exception and give two Peace Prizes this year so Trump could have one? Waaah! (Netanyahu nominated Trump for a consolation prize today in Israel, don’t worry.) Subscribe! Later, the topic shifted to the GOP’s government shutdown, now hitting the two-week mark. Welker played a montage of Trump saying during the Obama years that it’s the president’s job to settle a shutdown. Confronted with a conflicting truth he can’t deny, again Vance opted for accidental honesty. VANCE: Well, Kristen, the president was talking back then when Barack Obama was president about the political realities. We are focused now on the governing realities because we’re in power. In other words, it was really easy to armchair quarterback how amazing a dealmaker he would have been when Obama was president, but now he’s in charge and finding out he sucks. Got it. Now that the GOP has given up on last week’s lie about “illegals getting healthcare” as their boogeyman during this shutdown, Vance has moved on to faux empathy for the people affected by it. VANCE: Well, I just think it shows the different priorities of Democrats and Republicans in the midst of these shutdowns. You really have to ask yourself, “Who do we care more about? Federal bureaucrats in Washington DC or low-income women getting the food benefits they deserve, our troops getting the payment they need, flood insurance across the Southeast in the midst of hurricane season?” Are you fucking serious right now? The GOP has cut $267 billion in SNAP benefits, plus further cuts in the Blowjobs For Billionaires Bill. The Education Department just wiped out the special education offices.Tthe Trump administration proposed FEMA making it harder to get federal disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. Trump just gave a $20 billion bailout to Argentina’s libertarian government while they undercut American soybean farmers. And they’ve proposed stiffing furloughed federal workers on their backpay. GTFOH. Vance tried his luck with Margaret Brennan. Brennan pushed Vance on the self-inflicted chaos of the Trump Administration’s layoffs. BRENNAN: CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that’s not the case. But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC? VANCE: […] First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job […] But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. […] BRENNAN: […] But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. As we frantically search for hazmat suits on Amazon, we certainly feel confident if another pandemic happens under these chucklefucks. Brennan asked about labor union legal challenges to these layoffs, and Vance’s central processing system began to deteriorate as he spat this out. VANCE: Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases. This is gibberish. Third time’s the charm? Nah! George Stephanopoulos asked Vance about Border Czar Tom Homan being caught on tape by the FBI accepting a $50,000 bribe. Vance refused to answer the question repeatedly, so Stephanopoulos ended the interview in the only manner appropriate: STEPHANOPOULOS: I didn’t insinuate anything. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000, as was heard on an audio tape recorded by the FBI in September 2024. You did not answer the question. Thank you for your time. VANCE: No, George, I sai-- STEPHANOPOULOS: We’ll be right back. Stuffing these losers into metaphorical lockers is the only way to treat them. Have a week.

By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year. American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York’s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, it took on 300 people during its busy period. The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year’s $600,000. “The issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it’s too late,” Casterella said. ”I think everyone’s more mindful now than ever. ” Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago. But job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts overall holiday hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That’s fewer than last year’s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for roughly 120 companies like Lands’ End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year’s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said. Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, below the 32,700 a year ago. “We saw real strong signals that there’s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,” Challenger’s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Challenger also noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he’s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them. Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy’s are declining to offer figures, a departure from years past. Retailers’ hiring plans mark the first clues to what’s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that’s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions. The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers — companies, government agencies and nonprofits — added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected. The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture. In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday mass firings of federal workers have started. Analysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown’s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are selective. Analysts will also be watching how shoppers will react to price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said. Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year. Deloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That’s compares with 4.2% last year. And Adobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That’s smaller than last year’s 8.7% growth. Companies are increasingly wanting to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said. “In today’s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,” Radial’s Wnorowski said. So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff. Radial is also training holiday hires faster with new technology that’s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said. Meanwhile, Target will offer current workers additional hours and then will tap into a separate pool of workers— 43,000— who pick up shifts. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said. For the past few years, Walmart, the largest private employer, has been offering its workers extra hours available during the holidays, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it’s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but most locations will dole out those hours to current workers. Waiting until the last minute to hire could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that with the slowing economy, they don’t anticipate having a hard time. Meanwhile, the temporary halt of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about sales forecasts and the workers they may need. “Certainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,” Wnorowski of Radial said. “But we’ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we’ll adjust as soon we see things changing.”

Title: Inside Blur, the Indie VFX Animation Studio ‘By Artists, for Artists’ That’s Defying the Odds

Time Published: 2025-10-13T13:15:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Co-founder and owner Tim Miller and president Nan Morales talk about why they prefer to stay small and the studio’s next phase Even if you have never heard of Blur Studio, you’ve definitely seen its work. The Culver City, Calif.-based animation and visual effects studio does it all — the production of the wildly successful “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies and the Emmy-nominated animated anthology series “Love, Death & Robots” (on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (on Prime Video); video game cut scenes for AAA titles like “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare;” the jaw-dropping opening credits for David Fincher’s “Girl With the Dragon Tattoo:” and even the animation for Universal Studios’ The Simpsons Ride. Its 2004 animated short film “Gopher Broke,” directed by Jeff Fowler (who would go on to direct the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies), was nominated for an Oscar. Tim Miller, the company’s co-founder and owner, directed the first “Deadpool” movie and 2019’s “Terminator: Dark Fate.” But perhaps more impressive than the output is its financial performance. Blur Studio is profitable and has never been in debt or had outside financing or loans against the company. It was founded in 1995 and has roughly 100 employees. In an interview with TheWrap, Miller described Blur as “a company built by artists, for artists, to create content that I feel like otherwise wouldn’t make it to screens, big and small.” Nan Morales, Blur’s president, added, “I also think we spent the last few years recruiting the best teams globally and we’re building the community for the visual work and storytelling.” Its success stands in stark contrast with most visual effects houses that have trouble remaining afloat. The challenges emerge from productions awarding jobs to the lowest-bidder, creating an untenable situation when projects stretch over months and filmmakers demand countless VFX iterations — the impact being massive blockbusters with poor CGI scenes and a rising number of visual effects houses closing. So how did Blur avoid this fate? “I would love to say that it’s all due to precise planning and pinpoint accuracy and focus. But a lot of it is luck,” Miller said. “We got into the games industry, which to some degree has been protected by tax incentives, and it’s an industry that we love, which is the luckiest thing. We get to work with these great partners on this cutting edge technology, on the kind of subject matter that, honestly, I always wanted to work on.” The tax incentives that protected video game production allowed Blur to stay in Los Angeles at a time when studios were fleeing to Vancouver or London. Although the video game industry isn’t immune to periods of decline, as sweeping layoffs have hit major game companies over the last few years. Which makes Blur’s diversification all the more important. Miller said that most of Blur’s output is “work for hire.” There are plenty of projects that Blur is developing in-house but they function primarily as a studio who is hired by outside companies – video game publishers and streaming studios – to create content for them. Blur then partners with other studios to make sure that all the work gets done. This approach also adds visual variety to projects, like the different art styles and aesthetics that populate both “Love, Death & Robots” (developed in-house by Blur and streaming on Netflix) and “Secret Level” (a project that originated with Sony’s video game division and streams on Prime Video). “When I started the studio, it was because I thought nobody would let me direct an animated film unless I actually owned a studio that could do it, which was my reason for building it,” Miller said. But he’s also thankful he has “Love, Death & Robots,” an R-rated animated anthology series full of sex and violence that Blur produces and which allows him to “hire our competitors in the game cinematic space.” “They’re all people that normally are competing for jobs against us, which is great because it’s this really tight community of really driven boutique studios where I think the best artists are. On ‘Love, Death & Robots,’ we’ll do two or three episodes every season. And for now, for ‘Secret Level,’ we’ll do two or three episodes ourselves, and then we spread the love around.” When Miller started Blur in the 1995, the same year that Pixar released the first feature-length computer animated film “Toy Story,” he wanted to be “the dark Pixar and build this big company.” Los Angeles was the epicenter for the emerging computer animation movement. Now? “That’s not so much my goal,” Miller said. “It’s not sustainable,” Morales said of making that dream a reality. “We’re not seeing a business practice that that’s a sustainable market. We’re a small, boutique shop. We’re like 100 employees. People think we’re huge. We’re not. That’s why we have to have our vendor partners and seek out the best people that are out there.” Blur is an animation studio that develops projects and animates parts of those projects but also partners with other studios to complete the work. Blur might animate an entire opening title sequence or video game cinematic, but on larger, more complex projects like “Love, Death & Robots,” they’ll work with other studios to bring most of the segments to life. And on even the biggest projects, like the “Sonic the Hedgehog” movies (and the Paramount+ spinoff series “Knuckles”), studios like MPC and Industrial Light & Magic also worked on the effects and animation. It used to be that animation studios would do all the work for a single project, but it’s becoming more commonplace for a studio to work on most of the animation while also farming out different sections. DreamWorks Animation’s recent “The Bad Guys 2,” for example, had some key sequences handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Blur was quietly ahead of the curve. The work is having an impact on the industry. Morales talked about a small studio Blur worked with that was flying under the radar but was able to hire 150 people for a big job because of its work on “Secret Level.” “These boutique shops are doing quite well from ‘Secret Level’ and ‘Love Death & Robots,’ in the sense that their work is being shown globally,” Morales said. She added that this work keeps other studios from faltering. “2024 was awful,” Morales said. “I came into a huge dip in the economy for trailers and cinematics and even content. It just died out. In 2025, we did okay, and hopefully we keep going forward, it’s a struggle for everyone out there. And I’m really happy the way we have built a community of sharing, trying to help everyone stay afloat. It’s not the big companies, it’s the small companies that have to stand around, to make it competitive out there.” But while keeping Blur small makes the economics of the company work in its favor, Miller also has a creative reason for doing so. “My reason for the size of the company, is I realized I’m selfish, and running a big company doesn’t excite me as much as doing the work,” Miller said. “The only reason to be that big would be to get rich. And that doesn’t interest me nearly as much as making stuff.” Miller said that the model that they’ve worked out, where they collaborate with their partners and friends, is ideal. That way, when they come off of a show, they aren’t forced with cutting payroll or hours or employees just to stay afloat. “I’m working on a new idea to split the difference between a loose alliance of sorts that might help all the problems that these smaller studios face,” Miller teased. “But do I think about being a big behemoth? Those days might be over.” A major disrupter is entering the industry in the form of AI, with its magical promises of being able to produce entire animated films and cut the need for human creatives significantly (which so far, haven’t been fulfilled). But the process has an uncanny ability to mimic actual art, as was seen by the wave of Hayao Miyazaki rip-offs that flooded social media earlier this year. In June, Miller was on a panel at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival where other speakers were “dancing around the issue.” He dove right in. “I was like, ‘Why are you guys talking like this thing may go away or it may not be a factor or if we close our eyes, it might not exist? It’s not going to happen.’” In the past, any new technology or tool that would come along, Miller and other creatives in the field would jump on it, “because it would increase my creative abilities.” Not when it comes to AI. “I’ve seen a real resistance to the AI tools, and I get it, it feels like an existential threat to their jobs, and by extension, their families and their lives. I think that’s a very justified and real concern for the industry. I understand the terror, but it means that people stay away from it, and they cover their eyes and pretend it doesn’t happen,” Miller said, noting he would rather be in control of the technology than leave it to a large corporation. Miller and Blur had developed an adaptation of English author China Miéville’s 2000 novel “Perdido Street Station” at Amazon, which is no longer moving forward. The project was, in Miller’s estimation “incredibly complicated – lots of characters and creatures and everything.” The property was decidedly “not for kids” and would have been “prohibitively expensive to make with the traditional tools.” “But AI gives us a chance at using the efficiencies that it could bring to all parts of the pipeline to tell a story at a cost that it can afford to not be for 11-year-olds,” Miller said. “That kind of s–t gives me hope. It shouldn’t cost $200 million to make a movie.” “It’s innovation of tools,” Morales said of AI. “It’s not replacing the artist … As a tool base to allow us some more latitude and be able to create environments that aren’t key elements to a storytelling, I think people will accept that, and it will help us bring more stories to the public.” Not that she’s totally sold. She recently saw some AI-generated “content” (her word) and she found it wanting. “It’s not very visually pleasing,” Morales said. Miller was reluctant to get in a debate about what AI can or can’t do, because it might be able to do something that we don’t even know about yet. Still, it’s enough for Miller to quote Arthur C. Clarke – “the future is not only stranger than you imagine, it’s stranger than you can imagine.” “I feel a bit of that right now,” Miller admitted. “I personally believe that for the next 12 months, our plan is to not replace our pipeline. It’s about what parts of the process can we make better and more efficient. On the production side, being able to look at the data of how we do things and how long it takes and where we put our focus is as important as the actual pixel manipulation.” One thing that has remained slightly out of reach for Miller and the team at Blur has been the production of an animated feature. Morales said that the company can “definitely do” an animated feature and Miller said, “We have to work with our partners.” He said that “The Goon” — a graphic novel adaptation that Blur Studio and David Fincher have been trying to get off the ground since 2008 — had recently been set up at Netflix. It took a year to put the deal together. And a month after they signed the agreement, Netflix told them, “We’re not going to do adult animated features anymore.” “I’m like, Oh my God, f–king kill me,” Miller said. It just made him more determined to make it himself. Miller said that he’s sympathetic to what happens to these movies at studios, but Blur is always seemingly caught in those corporate crosshairs. “We’ve got so much cool stuff developed and then somebody leaves and the new person doesn’t like it or somebody doesn’t have the power to push it through,” he said. “Love, Death & Robots,” for instance, initially started life as a reboot of the animated anthology film “Heavy Metal,” based on the American comic book magazine known for its bleak, but visually lush, sci-fi, fantasy and horror elements. Miller had some amazing directors lined up to direct individual segments, including Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Zack Snyder, Guillermo del Toro and James Cameron. But after more than a decade, he pivoted and turned it into a television series, which has now had 45 episodes and received multiple Emmy wins, and remains one of the most exciting animated series currently streaming. Morales said that when she came to Blur, “I could see the future and the animation space filling in the live-action, tentpole movie space, when studios are looking at $200 million+ and I know in animation we could do that for a lot less and give them the same quality.” She points to the “Warhammer” episode of “Secret Level,” which is just as tense and thrilling as any live-action feature, rendered gorgeously (and in a video game engine, no less) for a fraction of the cost of, say, the latest Marvel Studios movie. “When I walked in the first day and talked to Tim and saw ‘Warhammer,’ I said, ‘That’s the future. That’s the future of big movies,” Morales said. “We have to embrace that and show that skill.’ And I think Blur can lead that charge for a lot of people. We’re seeing the ability to do it right now. It’s just actually putting it out there.” Using a video game engine to make an entire animated feature, or even part of an animated feature, would be a breakthrough, but the world of visual effects has been embracing the technology over the past few years. The most notable example of this is The Volume, the virtual stage system that Industrial Light & Magic developed and first employed on Lucasfilm’s Disney+ streaming series “The Mandalorian.” The technology, dubbed StageCraft, utilizes real-time computing and video game engines to create animated backdrops and star-fields live on set, instead of using a blue or green screen and filling it in later. And it’s being employed on movies that don’t take place in a galaxy far, far away, most recently on the Colin Farrell/Margot Robbie romantic fantasy “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” which debuted last month. Maybe the biggest challenge Miller faces, he said, is the “big group of people who just don’t like animation.” “They’re not going to come inside the tent. But if we can get across the uncanny valley, and I do think we’re almost there, then that opens up a whole different world of stories for animation,” Miller said. “It opens up a whole different demo of people who will watch the content because it looks like live action, or close enough to live action that it’ll get us across. I mean, video games did a lot to bring people into the adult animation tent.” About 15 years ago, a trailer surfaced for an adaptation of Eric Powell’s beloved comic book series “The Goon.” The brief clip, directed by Miller, was visually inventive and a loving reinvention of the source material. An eventual movie, produced by Fincher, was proposed, with a Kickstarter campaign launched to cover necessary pre-production costs. But the latest setback at Netflix hasn’t deterred Miller. Maybe, with the right tools, he says, it can finally see the light of day instead of remaining on Blur’s perpetual to-do list. “I don’t give up,” Miller said. “I never give up.” And you tend to believe him.

Title: H-1B visa crackdown not an existential threat to TCS; CEO Krithivasan says firm 'can survive'

Amid the uncertainty around H-1B visas, Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) K Krithivasan has opened up about the IT giant's view on the work visa, restrictions on which, introduced by US President Donald Trump, have rocked the industry. Krithivasan's comments take on particular importance, with TCS being the second-biggest beneficiary of the H-1B programme in 2025 after Amazon, with over 5,000 H-1B visas approved in 2025 alone. In an interview with Business Standard, Krithivasan addressed not just concerns regarding the work visa, but also spoke about the company's recent move to lay off 12,000 people globally. On the back of the layoffs, US Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin had raised questions about the company hiring over 5,500 H-1B workers, which the tech CEO addressed directly in the interview. Commenting on facing questions from US Senators, Krithivasan said, "I was neither happy nor unhappy. It gave me an opportunity to articulate our positions more clearly and to address the Senators’ questions about the H-1B issue." Explaining that the "figure of 5,500" pertained to people amending or renewing their H-1B petitions, the TCS CEO said that fresh applications were much lower, "probably around 2,500". "We have 31,000 to 32,000 employees in the US, of whom only 11,000 to 12,000 are on H-1B visas, while the rest are on other types of visas. We have been progressively increasing local workforce participation, which will continue because the way of work has changed with new kinds of projects and AI coming into play, where you need to work closely with the customer and need different skill sets," Krithivasan was quoted as saying. "It is not just about engineering skills anymore; there is a growing demand for creative thinking and prompt engineering skills. In FY26, we sent just 500 people from India to the US on H-1B visas, which means we can survive without them (H-1B visas). There is no dependence on H-1B visas," the TCS CEO, most notably, said. "There was a time when this was a significant retention policy, but over the past four-five years, it has been on a declining trend. It is now far less of a retention policy than it once was, and we should not be assessing today’s scenario through yesterday’s lens," he added. When quizzed about the mass layoffs at TCS, Krithivasan explained that only two categories of employees had been affected: those on the bench for three to six months, and those who were underperforming. "I don’t believe the Tata group, while humane, would have retained employees with performance issues," the chief of the IT giant was quoted as saying. He also explained that a "skill mismatch" also contributed to some of the layoffs. "We have relieved individuals where we see a skill mismatch for the future. The company is pivoting to be future-ready and a big player in the AI ecosystem. If someone doesn’t fit into the scheme of things, we need to exit them gracefully. This approach, I believe, does not conflict with our ethos," Krithivasan said. The Trump administration, which has described the H-1B programme as the one of the "most abused visa" systems in the US' immigration framework, recently slapped a $100,000 ( ₹88 lakh) fee on fresh applications, sending shockwaves across firms that rely on the programme to employ highly-skilled talent from around the world.
