But already this year dozens have left for Nvidia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Intel plans to reduce its workforce by several hundred employees at its Israeli research and development centers, following similar job cuts at its facilities elsewhere, reports DigiTimes. This move is part of the company's general cost-cutting measures amid financial challenges, and it opens opportunities for competitors to attract Intel's talent. There is a catch, though, as dozens of Intel employees already left the company for Nvidia earlier this year, according to Globes. Intel's Israeli operations employ around 11,700 people, including 7,800 in R&D roles and 3,900 in manufacturing, with the latest layoffs expected to focus on R&D while leaving manufacturing staff largely intact as Intel readies for the completion of Fab 38 in Kiryat Gat, the report says. The exact number of people that will either be proposed to leave voluntarily, or retire, or just laid off is not known, but Globes reports that Intel is set to cut its Israeli workforce by several hundred positions. Intel has three R&D sites in Israel. Each of these Israeli centers has a specialized focus: Haifa works on CPUs, AI hardware, and software; Petah Tikva develops communications and AI solutions; and Jerusalem is involved in communications, software, and cybersecurity. The report does not specify which R&D sites will see more cuts, other than saying that layoffs are expected in these R&D centers. But let us try to detail at least one thing. Intel's Israeli R&D team is responsible for multiple breakthrough microarchitectures, such as Banias, Yonah/Merom, and Nehalem, just to name a few. Each of these was strategically important for Intel at some point. In fact, the Banias processor was the heart of Intel's Centrino platform, the company's first platform developed specifically for laptops, which pretty much revolutionized the market. Yonah/Merom put Intel back on the map of high-performance PCs and replaced the power-hungry Netburst microarchitecture that powered Pentium 4 processors. But while Intel itself is slashing its R&D talent in Israel, it should be noted that people are leaving the company, too. Nvidia has been hiring former Intel employees: in 2024 alone, at least 30 Intel employees moved to Nvidia's offices in Yokneam and Tel Aviv, with total hires from Intel estimated to range from 60 to 90, according to the Globes report which analyzed LinkedIn profiles. Nvidia is expected to hire more Intel employees as the layoffs continue, possibly bringing the number to about 100. As of June 30, Nvidia reported a workforce of 4,000 employees in Israel, reflecting the company’s growing presence in the region. Many Intel employees who moved to Nvidia are benefiting from more attractive compensation packages. For instance, a junior hardware engineer at Nvidia can expect a starting annual salary of NIS 566,000 (around $151,500), about 33% higher than the equivalent role at Intel. Nvidia also offers significantly more valuable share options compared to Intel, with packages starting at NIS 56,200 annually ($15,045). In addition to Nvidia, other major tech companies are also drawing former Intel employees. Apple, Amazon, and Intel's subsidiary Mobileye have recently hired from Intel's workforce in Israel. Some groups have joined Microsoft, Google, and Huawei, which operates a development center in Haifa. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Title: DAILY BEAST Tries to Claw Way Back to Relevance...
URL: https://dnyuz.com/2024/11/03/the-daily-beast-tries-to-claw-its-way-back-to-relevance/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T12:31:37Z
Full Content:
On a sunny morning in early October, Joanna Coles, clad in a stylish tomato-red coat, and Ben Sherwood, dressed more demurely in a corduroy jacket, convened at their regular breakfast spot, the no-frills Star on 18 diner on Manhattan’s Far West Side. The two veteran media executives were talking about their ambitious plans for The Daily Beast, the 16-year-old money-losing news website, in which they jointly acquired a minority stake in April. But along with the predictable optimism about the mission they are taking on and enthusiasm about early signs of audience uptick and subscriber growth, Ms. Coles, a former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and Mr. Sherwood, a onetime president of ABC News and Disney TV chief, also conveyed a sense of frustration. Frustration that they weren’t greeted by the staff they inherited as warmly as they expected. Frustration that the site’s tech problems meant they’ve had to buy multiple subscriptions just to log in. Frustration that convincing the newsroom of their editorial vision has been an uphill climb. Less than three weeks after the pair’s takeover, New York magazine published a detailed report on the friction between reporters and Ms. Coles over story suggestions that they deemed ridiculous, including an investigation into whether former President Donald J. Trump was having stress-induced flatulence during his criminal trial and a list of the most obese members of Congress. (Neither article ran.) It was clear that many of the sources for the report were inside the organization, with one unnamed staff member bluntly criticizing the new owners’ “warped vision” of the news site. “This thing came within a day of being sold to the private equity knacker’s yard, where it would have been stripped,” Ms. Coles said later in an interview at The Beast’s offices in Chelsea, using a British term for a junkyard. “In what way is it helpful to tape our conversations and to proudly boast that you are not going to even attempt to look at the stories that your new bosses are asking you to look at?” “To me, that’s just, like, ‘No wonder the place is going out of business,’” she added. For his part, Mr. Sherwood was aghast that Beast journalists had anonymously complained about a Daily Beast article on plans by Barron Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest son, to attend New York University. The article relied on a source of Ms. Coles and was published without a byline. “That happens to be something that she knew stone cold — her source was solid,” Mr. Sherwood said. “The organization went into a convulsion over this because Joanna did not reveal her source and no one could stand this up with any of their sources.” But, he asked, “where is Barron Trump at school now?” Indeed, the 18-year-old was spotted on the New York University campus for the start of the school year in September. Mr. Sherwood wrote a Beast article confirming the April scoop. The Daily Beast, launched in 2008 by the longtime magazine editor Tina Brown and backed by Barry Diller’s IAC, became known over the years as a cheeky and aggressive tabloid with reporting on politics and national security that often had an impact belying the relatively small size of its newsroom. In recent years, it published a series of damaging scoops on the Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker and broke the news of the arrest of the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Named for the fictional newspaper in Evelyn Waugh’s “Scoop,” The Daily Beast gave a platform to a new generation of writers, like Taylor Lorenz, Jamelle Bouie and Molly Jong-Fast. When Ms. Brown started the site — after stints editing Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and, less successfully, Talk magazine — she preached a mix of “high-low” stories. “The Daily Beast at its best was mischievous, subversive and absolutely 100 percent dedicated, often to the point of sociopathy, to breaking big news,” said Noah Shachtman, its editor in chief from 2018 to 2021. “If you look back at this moment in previous election cycles, The Beast played an incredible role.” But the outlet continuously lost money, and audience traffic has declined over the last two years. Fed up with the losses, Mr. Diller tried to offload The Daily Beast, at one point considering a deal with the Hollywood publication The Ankler and then looking to sell to a private-equity-backed publisher before landing on the partnership with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles. “It was imminent: We were selling The Beast,” Mr. Diller said in an interview. But after meeting with Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, he felt their plan made sense. “I want to give it a last chance,” Mr. Diller said. “It’s very early in the process, but I am more than pleased that we made that decision.” Mr. Sherwood, 60, and Ms. Coles, 62, were jointly granted a 49 percent equity stake in the business, returning them to the day-to-day scrum of a media company. (None of the parties would disclose the financial details of the deal; IAC still retains majority control.) The two seem, on the face of it, an odd pairing. She’s a glamorous Briton who conquered the world of glossy magazines and is best known for her star turn as editor in chief of Cosmopolitan from 2012 to 2016. He’s a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar who made “Good Morning America” the top morning news show while president of ABC News from 2010 to 2014, before being promoted to oversee Disney’s TV group. They struck up a friendship in 2013 after Mr. Sherwood was impressed by a speech Ms. Coles gave at a New York awards event. By his telling, he went back to his office and immediately wrote her a letter saying he was inspired by her story of coming from Yorkshire, England, to “the pinnacle of publishing in America.” The pair met for lunch and discovered a mutually voracious love for the news. “We would try to text each other stories that we thought the other wouldn’t have come across,” Ms. Coles said. “And he really doesn’t miss anything. His breadth of reading is astonishing to me.” He has “a sense of the absurd and the funny, which a lot of people don’t,” she added. The two talked about doing a journalism project together when Ms. Coles left Hearst in 2018, after she was passed over for the presidency of the magazine division, and Mr. Sherwood left Disney in 2019. But nothing quite came together. In the years that followed, Mr. Sherwood founded and sold Mojo, a youth sports start-up, and Ms. Coles executive-produced the Freeform show “The Bold Type” while heading up a so-called blank-check company and sitting on the boards of Snap and Sonos. The thought of returning to a newsroom thrilled both Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles, especially one that had the benefit of years of brand building under editors like Ms. Brown, John Avlon (now running for Congress), Mr. Shachtman (who went on to lead Rolling Stone) and Tracy Connor, who had come to The Daily Beast from the NBC News investigative unit. But Ms. Coles and Mr. Sherwood had to immediately confront the fact that the media landscape had changed significantly in their time away from it. In the past few years, BuzzFeed News has shut down, Vice Media filed for bankruptcy and other publishers did mass layoffs. And new competitors kept coming: Puck, Punchbowl, The Free Press, Semafor, the various writers building their singular empires on Substack (including, just recently, Ms. Brown herself). The Beast was on track to lose $10 million this year, Mr. Sherwood said, and had been losing money and audience for five consecutive quarters before the deal in April. “The plans that had been set in place were on a path to lose tens and tens of millions of dollars, and that path was no longer viable and IAC was no longer going to do that,” Mr. Sherwood said. That was the message he and Ms. Coles delivered when they met with the staff of The Daily Beast for the first time on April 15. They thought the newsroom would be relieved that it was now in the hands of experienced media executives with serious bona fides who were committed to revitalizing it. The Beast staff saw it differently. According to interviews with nearly a dozen former and current members, some of whom shared notes taken at the first meetings with their new bosses, and all of whom asked to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardizing their career prospects, Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles came across as aggressive and relentlessly negative about the state of The Beast and the work that its staff was doing. Ms. Coles, who serves as the chief creative and content officer and runs the editorial side of the operation, told the staff that she and Mr. Sherwood wanted more “funny” and would “flood the zone” with content, the staff members said. Mr. Sherwood, who is the publisher and chief executive, became visibly angry when discussing his personal grievance: the technology issues that bedeviled the site’s paywall and payment system. In the weeks that followed, Ms. Coles began issuing story ideas that many in the newsroom chafed at and suggested hiring a “Lauren Sánchez correspondent” to report on the fiancée of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Reporters started leaving, including the Washington bureau chief, Matt Fuller, and some of his political reporters. (Mr. Fuller’s replacement, Martin Pengelly, a journalist from The Guardian, lasted five weeks in the job.) In early June, The Beast’s editor in chief since 2021, Ms. Connor, was replaced with Hugh Dougherty, an editor from The New York Post and, like Ms. Coles, a veteran of the British press. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles announced a voluntary buyout program with an aim of cutting costs by $1.5 million. By the beginning of July, The Beast’s head count was down about 35 percent through the buyouts and a handful of layoffs. Ms. Coles has a specific vision for what The Beast can do: shorter and sharper articles that focus on people, power, politics and pop culture, with a dose of satire to lighten the mood during a perilous time. She says she is fascinated by the extremes of wealth and power and behavior, and pointed to articles about A-list celebrities who gave Sean Combs cover and the troubles of Will Lewis, the chief executive of The Washington Post, as recent highlights. “I wanted something that curated a lot of news out there that wasn’t about the end of democracy all the time,” she said. Ms. Coles said she felt that The Beast had “some very good editors” over the years, but that its place in the media landscape had been diminished. “I certainly wasn’t reading it on a regular basis,” she said. “Another editor said to me when we came here, he said: ‘It’s the boring avatar of the resistance.’ I thought he summed it up in one.” She is trying to spark ideas and reinvigorate the newsroom’s culture, which she said had been affected when the pandemic caused more people to work remotely. Beast employees are now required to work in the office four days a week. “We have some really good people here who were here all along who are excited by the mission and re-energized,” Ms. Coles said. There are others she was not as fond of. Ms. Coles recounted that a political reporter did not call in to the newsroom on the Sunday that President Biden announced he would drop out of the presidential race. Ms. Coles was at her house in the Hamptons that day, hosting her friend Emma Tucker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal and a fellow Briton, and the pair “turned my dining room table into an ad hoc newsroom.” “I was incredulous that a political reporter would not call in because it was the weekend,” she said. “To me it was madness that we would have political correspondents who didn’t want to cover that story immediately.” That political reporter, Jake Lahut, who has since left, referred The New York Times to the three articles he filed the day that Mr. Biden dropped out. “The most important lesson I’ve learned from this is how not to run a newsroom,” Mr. Lahut said. There has been “a Niagara of news,” as Ms. Coles described it, in the lead-up to November’s election, but The Beast’s newsroom is now less than half the size it was six months ago. And days away from the presidential election, the Washington bureau is staffed with just two people. “They saved us, to what end?” one reporter who has left The Beast asked. “What is The Daily Beast now, and is it better?” The lack of staffing during an intense news period has turned the newsroom into a churn factory, according to people with knowledge of the work environment, with pressure on employees to pump out articles to generate as much reader traffic as possible. The newsroom has been asked to publish at least 40 posts a day, which is what it was producing before the staffing cuts. According to a presentation given to the newsroom in September, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, The Daily Beast published more than 210 articles in three days around the presidential debate in September. Many of the articles on the website are now aggregated from content published elsewhere or written by freelance contributors, though there is still some original reporting. Mr. Sherwood and Ms. Coles have also contributed to the site, with Mr. Sherwood appearing to relish a return to his reporting days of decades ago: He has already written more than 50 articles, including updates on the Menendez brothers’ case (which Mr. Sherwood notes he has followed since 1989) and a post on the 100th birthday of the Caesar salad. The Coles-and-Sherwood Daily Beast has had its outside detractors. Ms. Jong-Fast, the MSNBC pundit and former Beast editor-at-large, said in an interview: “At a time when we need brave voices and serious journalism more than ever, it’s devastating to watch it devolve into tacky clickbait.” The NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny, another former Beast writer, posted a similar view on Instagram Threads in September: “It’s weird watching someone buy something you love, take that thing that was once good, and just slowly murder it in public. Anyway RIP The Daily Beast.” Despite criticism of The Beast’s editorial approach, Mr. Sherwood credited the heightened news cycle over the last few months with helping the site record four months of subscriber growth. Data from the measurement firm Comscore showed a recent bump in visitors to The Beast’s site, with 21.3 million in September, up from a monthly average of 13.8 million in 2023. “They have had a profitable month or two, which historically has not happened at The Beast,” Mr. Diller said. “That is quite significant.” Mr. Sherwood said they were stabilizing the business by getting the staff to the right size, fixing the technology powering the website and migrating to a new content management system. (The company recently added a president and chief operating officer, the tech entrepreneur Keith Bonnici.) Mr. Sherwood said they would focus on growth in their second year, such as exploring new revenue streams. “We are totally aware of how hard and adverse the conditions are,” Mr. Sherwood said, but “we’re more optimistic in the path than ever with independent, feisty, intelligent tabloid journalism.” Ms. Coles has focused on building buzz for the new Daily Beast. She regularly appears on cable television shows, and recently suggested without evidence on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Mr. Trump was “microdosing drugs,” a claim the host Jonathan Lemire had to quickly clear up. She has tapped her extensive Rolodex to sign up Samantha Bee, the television host and comedian, to co-host a podcast with her. Guests so far have included the “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver and the Democratic strategist James Carville. The Beast also was quick to jump on the non-endorsement scandals engulfing The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, posting a link to subscribe on X with the message: “The Daily Beast reports without fear or favor. Apparently, that’s something not all newsrooms can do.” Ms. Brown, the founder, said she had advised Ms. Coles on “reviving the talent” and getting a mix of seasoned reporters and young writers. “The Daily Beast is really an upscale tabloid with attitude,” Ms. Brown said. “I think it definitely needed a face-lift.” The post The Daily Beast Tries to Claw Its Way Back to Relevance appeared first on New York Times.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, a roundup of some of our top stories. We're into the final hours before election day. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted. Business Insider will be covering this final stretch and the days that follow with a sharp focus on what the next president will mean for you. From the prices you pay to how to invest, we'll have you covered. And if you're looking for a break from politics, we'll also continue to bring you all of the most important stories in business. You can find it all on our homepage or on our app. On the agenda today: But first: Takeaways from a big week in Big Tech. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. The trillion-dollar giants of Big Tech reported earnings this week, beating estimates and committing billions to AI. The big winners: Those able to signal a strong return on that investment. Alphabet Google's cloud business benefited from AI adoption, posting a 35% year-over-year increase in revenues, while CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of the company's new code is now created by AI. The core advertising business held strong despite growing competition from the likes of OpenAI, Reddit, and more. Amazon The retail and cloud giant smashed expectations, sending the stock soaring on Friday. It also benefited from AI adoption, as cloud unit AWS posted a 19% increase in revenues. A strong performance in retail, where execs said shoppers were buying cheaper items at higher volumes, and a sharp focus on cost control had investors cheering. Apple Apple beat revenue and profit estimates overall, but a year-over-year decline in revenue in China left investors underwhelmed. All eyes are now on demand for the iPhone 16 and whether new Apple Intelligence features help juice sales. Meta Meta beat estimates, though user growth came in below expectations. Mark Zuckerberg promised to keep spending on AI and flexed Meta's huge cluster of Nvidia H100 chips. Microsoft Microsoft also beat estimates, but concerns around capacity constraints in AI and the return on its investments in the space led the tech giant's stock lower across the week. In preparation for its future of autonomous vehicles, Tesla has been leaning on a specialized group of test drivers, part of what's known internally as "Project Rodeo." BI spoke with nine test drivers, who described sometimes perilous scenarios and near-crashes while testing unreleased software. Here's what they said. Scaling the corporate ladder was once a cornerstone of the American dream. Now, 42% of Americans say they don't even want a promotion, according to a survey by global HR consultancy Randstad. That's higher than the countries known for being more chill about work, like Italy, Spain, and New Zealand. The anti-advancement shift has left bosses scratching their heads. If promotions won't motivate workers, what will? Packing up the corporate ladder. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on freebies. It's part of a wider push to cut costs across the industry. The lavish perks culture, once aimed at subsidizing nearly everything, led to entitlement and rule-bending among some employees. In a new era of efficiency and layoffs, tech workers need to get used to a new, non-extravagant normal. Use it, don't abuse it. As tension builds in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States Army is training warfighters for combat if a conflict with China breaks out. BI's Graham Flanagan spent two weeks in Hawaii to document the Army's sprawling, $16 million war-games exercise across the island chain. Watch the documentary here. This week's quote: "We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate." — Amazon employees in a signed letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman, protesting his return-to-office comments. More of this week's top reads: LinkedIn thinks using AI could fix our hiring crisis — and help your career. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 3, 2024 Lionsgate Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina and Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 “Beware of the cliché, the predictable”: that’s one of the notes about storytelling that Francis Ford Coppola keeps posted where he works, as he reports in his book Live Cinema and Its Techniques.1 Watching Megalopolis—Coppola’s first film in thirteen years, funded with over $100 million of his own money—I realized that it should be two rules, not one. Cliché and predictable are not, in fact, synonyms. Megalopolis is one of the least predictable films ever made, a disorienting jumble of sci-fi, romance, political drama, historical epic, body horror, musical, satire, surrealism, magical realism, filmed theater, illustrated lecture, and inspirational after-school special. Scenes veer from stagy speeches to slapstick violence, hallucinatory dance numbers to raunchy sex to flashy special effects. Baffling details flicker by—a tree stump in the shape of a swastika, a sudden murder with a tiny bow and arrow, repeated incest jokes—not only without explanation but often without acknowledgment. A character might set off on a crucial mission only to disappear, and then be summarily killed in a flashback. A ludicrous plot twist might be interrupted by a moment of startling beauty. The protagonist, Cesar, played by Adam Driver, can stop time—an ability given increasing symbolic weight but no elaboration, and which he never puts to any use at all. And yet, somehow, amid or perhaps beneath the chaos, the film is constructed almost entirely from clichés. Its hero is a wild playboy who is also a moody genius with a tragic, secret past; he has fabulous wealth, a loyal majordomo/father figure, a confusing amount of political power (it makes more sense if you have read the back of The Power Broker, less if you have read the book), a mother who is never satisfied, and a Nobel Prize. He wants to remake his city—how is never exactly clear, though it involves more parks, and perhaps a new form of moving sidewalk—but is resisted by the elite, who are corrupt or depraved or both: the depraved ones do cocaine in spacious, well-lit nightclubs, and the corrupt skulk around in dark fedoras. The mayor, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), is corrupt not in any particular actions but as a basic feature, the way some people are tall or left-handed. He has a pragmatic fixer named, the credits tell us, “Nush ‘the Fixer’ Berman,” as well as a beautiful, pure-hearted daughter, who falls in love with the hero and, slowly but surely, wins her father over to the hero’s cause. America is a decadent empire—like Rome, which is why the film’s version of New York is renamed New Rome, and why some (but not all) of the characters have Roman names and occasionally take part in Roman-ish activities. Here we encounter a strange phenomenon: a set of symbols so obvious they obscure the things they symbolize. The high and the low of New Rome gather in a coliseum to watch gladiators wrestle: What does this tell us about life in the nonfictional America, where actors, pop stars, and Donald Trump can be found cageside at UFC fights, while millions watch from home? (In case we’d forgotten the phrase “bread and circuses,” New Rome’s fights and chariot races are followed by a literal circus.) The festivities also include a set of “Vestal Virgins,” led by a singer named Vesta who is celebrated simultaneously for her sex appeal and her ostentatious chastity, and who later pivots to a bad-girl image after a scandal—which would all be quite illuminating, perhaps, if Britney Spears or Miley Cyrus had never existed. The film’s setting, too, is a chaotic rearrangement of the deeply familiar: not just ancient Rome added onto New York, but a version of New York that seems to exist simultaneously in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2020s. It’s a city of overcoats and flash drives, deep fakes and dusty municipal archives—all, one assumes, to indicate the timelessness of this “fable,” as the opening credits declare it. It is a confounding thing to watch. * In his notes about Fountain City—the 1,500-page novel, also about a visionary attempting to create a new urban utopia, that he worked on for years before finally abandoning—Michael Chabon uses the term draftitis to explain some of the book’s deficiencies. It “is a condition seen in manuscripts that have been rewritten several times,” he explains, especially “in passages where the writer has changed his or her mind,” a problem that “plagued me most often in my work as a screenwriter.” The problems might seem superficial, but they are “often a symptom of a more serious condition, namely authorial alienation.” That alienation seems to afflict much of Megalopolis. Coppola has, by his own account, been gathering material for the project for over forty years, and “must have rewritten it 300 times.” Much of the original research and conception was done in the 1980s, but Coppola’s first serious attempt to make it wasn’t until 2001; the film was well into preproduction when the September 11 attacks happened, putting it on hold again. (One plot point, strangely rushed past despite its importance, involves an old Soviet satellite plummeting from space and destroying a chunk of lower Manhattan.) It is hard not to think of this span of time while you watch, as characters, tones, and themes drift in and out erratically, like several different movies superimposed on one another. Even the grandest moments of spectacle and drama—a love scene on girders suspended above a glowing city, a political conspiracy breaking out into mob violence—come through as thin and muffled, as if we were watching them from far away. Advertisement Part of this is stylistic. In the decades since Coppola’s run of masterpieces in the 1970s—The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, Apocalypse Now—he has been looking for a way to make an entirely different sort of movie. “There are any number of styles one is able to choose in the movie business,” he complains in Live Cinema, “as long as it’s realism.” He means that word quite broadly, it seems, to include any film based around naturalistic lighting, lifelike sets, or location shooting. (There are plenty of definitions, after all, that would exclude all four of his most famous films: a pair of romanticized gangster epics, a paranoid thriller, and a surreal war movie.) Some of the work-for-hire he produced after he went bankrupt in the 1980s was necessarily in the traditional Hollywood mode, but the films on which he has had the most freedom have been marked by flamboyant artificiality: the glowing soundstage pseudo-Vegas of One from the Heart (1981), the anachronistic in-camera special effects of Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992), the fairytale dreamscapes of Twixt (2011). Lionsgate Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero and Adam Driver as Cesar Catilina in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 In his recent book The Path to Paradise: A Francis Ford Coppola Story—a partial biography, mainly focused on the shooting of Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart, with the production of Megalopolis acting as a frame—Sam Wasson explains this shift as a reaction to the chaos of Apocalypse Now.2 In that film, Wasson writes, Coppola “had had a hard time getting real life to look the way he wanted it to look.” (A droll understatement, for a location shoot that went months over schedule and millions over budget, killed a crew member and hospitalized its lead actor, and drove Coppola into near-breakdown and marital estrangement.) “Shooting at a studio,” as he did for One from the Heart, “it was easier to control all the elements of moviemaking—color, light, scenery, actors—the way a painter has to control every brushstroke on his canvas.” Or, perhaps, the way Cesar yearns to control his city. Megalopolis, likewise, was shot primarily on soundstages, and makes extensive use of digital backdrops. Any hint of the real world is carefully excluded, in favor of a glowing, golden-hued artificiality, otherworldly and airless in equal measure. Its backgrounds are never more than that, flat and distant from the actors no matter how many inventive flourishes are packed into them. Among other things, Wasson’s book offers a reminder of how intertwined Coppola’s career has been with that of George Lucas. Lucas’s very first job in Hollywood was as an assistant on Coppola’s 1968 musical, Finian’s Rainbow, and Coppola produced Lucas’s first two feature films, THX 1138 (1971) and American Graffiti (1973). They shared collaborators, most notably the editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and scripts (Lucas was at one point meant to direct Apocalypse Now). And both, as they became successful, attempted to change how movies were made: not just “pursuing similar if not identical goals in the advancement of post-production technology”—Coppola was a pioneer of electronic editing and quadrophonic sound mixing, as Lucas was of special effects—but creating their own alternatives to the studio system. Lucasfilm was a more staid, less artistically radical (and less financially reckless) endeavor than Coppola’s American Zoetrope, yet “we both have the same goals,” Lucas declared. “We both have the same ideas and we both have the same ambitions.” In fact, the closest thing there is to a precedent for Megalopolis is Lucas’s own high-budget passion project: the Star Wars prequels. They share with Coppola’s film a stultifying reliance on digital backgrounds. They share, too, a discordant mix of acting styles, as each performer struggles in their own way to deliver wooden, ridiculous dialogue—alongside Hayden Christensen’s “I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere,” we now have Driver’s “Go back to the cluuub.” In both, the filmmaker was insulated, through sheer monetary abundance, from any and all interference, untethered from corporate dictates and collaborative compromise. But the Star Wars prequels are still grounded in a familiar fictional setting and guided by Lucas’s instincts as a showman—they are meant above all to entertain. Megalopolis is after something else, something more ambitious and inward. Advertisement * Wasson describes Coppola approaching filmmaking from the beginning of his career as a personal “rite of passage…each [project] lived by Coppola in tandem with his creation.” But most of his earlier works started with other people’s ideas: the Godfather films with Mario Puzo’s novel, Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart with preexisting scripts, not to mention the various hired-gun projects that followed. Someone else’s vision was always there for Coppola to struggle with and build on, however much he eventually made it his own. Lionsgate Grace Vanderwaal, center, as Vesta Sweetwater in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 His films this century—three small-scale features, which he has said “were meant to teach me what making movies really was,” and now Megalopolis—are more directly personal. Each contains at least some aspect drawn straight from his own life. The very first line of 2007’s Youth Without Youth (based on a novel by Mircea Eliade, his only recent film not a wholly original script) speaks to its director’s fears: “Sometimes,” the elderly protagonist declares, “I admit to myself that it’s possible I will never be able to finish my life’s work.” Much of the dramatic situation of Tetro (2009)—a younger brother estranged, as Coppola was, from the older brother he reveres, both siblings oppressed by an arrogant composer father much like the Coppolas’—matches his biography, right down to the father’s declaration that the family has room for only one genius, him. The climax of Twixt comes with a flashback to the death of the protagonist’s child in a boating accident, which is how Coppola’s eldest son was killed. In Megalopolis, Cesar’s airy penthouse office, where he dreams up his vision for a new city, seems modeled after the one on top of the Sentinel Building in San Francisco that Coppola had renovated after the success of The Godfather—a room “so beautiful…Coppola would tell [the designer] he wouldn’t let anyone photograph it,” Wasson reports. And Cesar’s Renaissance man workshop full of excited young people expresses Coppola’s dreams for American Zoetrope, a place where “everybody—all the filmmakers—could do whatever they wanted,” and where schoolchildren were brought in to learn film production firsthand. Even minor details turn out to be plucked from autobiography, like a brief appearance by two young reporters from The Dingbat News—which is the name of the schoolgirl newsletter Sofia Coppola and her friends wrote on the Zoetrope lot in the early 1980s. And yet, perversely, as his work has become more personal, at times nakedly autobiographical, it has also become less affecting. These moments, which should be moving or even heartbreaking, are instead melodramatic, campy, or just confusing. It is as if the deeper he has gone into his own experiences and emotions, the further he has left the rest of us behind. He’s down there somewhere; we can hear his voice, drifting up in fragments. * One word that comes through quite clearly is “ideas.” That, we have repeatedly been told, is what Megalopolis is really about. Coppola has spoken about all the books he drew from while working on it—Herman Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game, Stephen Greenblatt’s The Swerve, David Graeber’s Debt, Bullshit Jobs, and The Dawn of Everything, along with “everything I had ever read or learned about.” Mayor Cicero and Cesar are self-evidently meant to represent ideas of how to approach urban life, and life in general: the worldly and cynical (“People don’t need dreams, people need help now”) versus the idealistic (“Don’t let the now destroy the forever”), with the deck stacked heavily in favor of the latter. The ideas stop there. There is little discussion about how cities actually work, or could work; about how societies change, or might be changed; about history or government or anything else. Cesar’s utopian vision seems to consist of a few stray quotes from Shakespeare and Marcus Aurelius, a vague notion that rooms could change along with their inhabitants, and an affection for parks. His grand Megalopolis project, revealed at the end of the film, looks like a slightly vegetal remix of the Vessel, from New York’s Hudson Yards—a hideous tourist trap that has been repeatedly shut down after people killed themselves by jumping off it. Lionsgate Giancarlo Esposito as Mayor Cicero in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 If you stay for the credits, you might notice one for an “architectural and scientific advisor”: Neri Oxman, the designer and former MIT professor who, after Business Insider accused her of plagiarism this past January, was vigorously defended by her husband, the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Her “Man-Nahāta” project—a set of studies of the possible future of New York City, including a group of circular models exhibited at SFMOMA in 2022, commissioned by Coppola though essentially absent from the film—imagines the city overrun, in the coming centuries, not just by climate change but by great waves of jargon: “the city undergoes time-based decomposition, its organic substances breaking down into megalithic architectural elements.” Perusing the website of Oxman, the design firm she launched this fall, is almost as baffling as watching Megalopolis, as genuine environmental concerns disappear into the fog of sentences like “a generative design process that unites human-centric cultural typologies with Nature-centric needs to maximize ecological thriving.” One of the most discussed scenes in the film is a brief press conference Cesar holds, around the midpoint. At a few screenings, this moment involved a sudden outbreak of live performance: someone would emerge from the audience and ask a prewritten question into a microphone, to which Cesar would respond onscreen. Coppola’s original plan was to use a version of Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant to allow the actual audience to shout out questions, with the most relevant of several clips of Cesar answering then played in response—a plan that was abandoned after a wave of Amazon layoffs included the engineers who were working with Coppola. It’s an audacious idea, but the most shocking thing about this scene is how Cesar actually responds, no matter his questioner. “Is this society,” he asks, “is this way we’re living, the only one that’s available to us? And when we ask these questions, when there’s a dialogue about them, that basically is a utopia.” That, basically, is the level of thought this film provides. We get repeated gestures in the direction of ideas, or rather Ideas, restatements of the need for discussion, but no actual discussion—no details, no complications, no development. At some point over the years, Coppola seems to have lost touch not only with who these characters are and what kind of world they exist in, but with why any of this mattered in the first place. This is one of the most peculiar things about Megalopolis: it is so unusual, so packed with incident, and so clearly of such vast importance to its creator, yet it feels so empty. Sometime later, Cesar repeats himself: “We are in need of a great debate about the future!” he announces in the film’s finale, and it is never clearer that Coppola is speaking through him to us. But all he’s saying is that someone should say something. * Megalopolis might, in the end, be most intelligible not as an analysis but as a symptom. In the story of Cesar the misunderstood genius, the dictatorial apostle of dialogue, we can see glimpses of a very particular understanding of the world. This is what it looks like to a self-confident man of a certain sort: someone who has been rich and famous for over half his life, someone who is convinced of his own benevolence, who still sees himself as an outsider, who says things like “What I do is create chaos and then try to control it.” (It is true that Coppola went bankrupt in the middle of his career, but there are bankruptcies and there are bankruptcies, as Trump has taught us. Coppola’s was not the kind where you lose your health care or end up homeless, but the kind where you have to direct The Rainmaker.) This is evidently what he worries about and how he thinks things work. This is the world—this is us—seen from the top of the tower. It is a world, for instance, in which a few chosen people—artists, who are the same as scientists—can achieve almost anything, as long as they have a beautiful woman by their side to inspire them, and to run home and make dinner. (She may still be a professional subordinate, if it’s early in the relationship.) It’s a world in which true change is decided by a couple of men—rich, powerful, and probably related to each other—arguing across a very expensive table. A world in which democracy is, on those rare occasions when one is forced to acknowledge it, never anything more than a mob of idiots, manipulated by a few degenerates. A world in which powerful oratory—powerful enough, on one occasion, to completely subdue that mob—involves reciting Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” soliloquy in its entirety, and asking questions like “What is time?” There are times when Megalopolis feels like it should be set not in New York, or New Rome, but in Silicon Valley. Cesar’s gleaming vision of the future has a distinct air of the tech campus. His vague, unbounded genius seems an emanation from the ego of a very well-funded founder, the kind of man who employs so many scientists and engineers he starts to think he is both. At other times, the movie feels set in a hazy memory of New York, a storybook city of animate statues and sneering villains, waiting for a caring father to set things right. Lionsgate Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis, 2024 It is also a world in which there is nothing more dangerous than a sexy second wife. This is a subject on which the film becomes unusually coherent: the subplot in which the financial reporter Wow Platinum seduces and manipulates the rich, elderly banker Crassus and uses his wealth for her own spiteful ends is the most forceful and sustained section of the story. That Aubrey Plaza’s writhing, maniacal performance as Wow is delightful does not change what a tired, misogynistic caricature she is, a barely human creature of lust and viciousness. She is also the only major character who is killed, and quite brutally. One might notice, as well, that this is a world in which sex scandals turn out to be bullshit—just another speed bump thrown up by the haters. When Cesar’s enemies accuse him of statutory rape, the charges are doubly dismissed: not only was the sex tape a deep fake, but the girl was lying about her age and was actually in her twenties all along. Here we might remember a few things: that the index to Wasson’s book has entries under “Coppola, Francis Ford, infidelity of,” including an account of a long-term relationship in the 1970s with an assistant; that he has declared that he intentionally cast “canceled” actors in Megalopolis, such as Jon Voight and Shia LaBeouf, to avoid it being “deemed some woke Hollywood production”; and that he has been accused by an extra of sexual harassment on the set of the film—which he has vigorously denied, and over which he has since sued Variety, which reported the allegations, for $15 million. Or perhaps a few of us might remember something he said back in 2006, when asked about Victor Salva, a filmmaker he supported professionally both before and after Salva was convicted of molesting a child actor while filming his first feature, Clownhouse (1989). “You have to remember,” Coppola told a reporter, “while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small—Victor was practically a child himself.” Salva was twenty-nine years old at the time of the crime, his victim twelve. There may, in the end, be a benefit to Megalopolis’s chronic draftitis. With its long and messy gestation, it unintentionally tracks some of the most destructive changes of the past half-century: the smooth slide of countercultural idealism into technocratic arrogance, the ascent of the very rich into a cuckooland of mushy pseudo-thought and thin-skinned vindictiveness, the decay of Great Man hero worship into misogynistic backlash. Watching this film is a very effective—and very useful—reminder of how inimical extreme wealth is to democratic thinking, to clear thinking in general, and to basic human sympathy. “If I could leave you with one thought after you see my new film,” Coppola wrote in a statement that accompanied early screenings of Megalopolis, “it would be this: Our founders borrowed a Constitution, Roman Law, and Senate for their revolutionary government without a king, so American History could neither have taken place nor succeed as it did without classical learning to guide it.” For better or for worse, I doubt a single member of its audience has left the theater with that in mind. The more sympathetic might be thinking of the pathos of an octogenarian director devoting his millions to a story about a man who can stop time. Others might be laughing at the headline, briefly glimpsed in a montage, declaring “TEEN PREGNANCY SKYROCKETS!” or wondering at the genuinely astonishing shot, late in the film, of a pregnant woman underwater who turns out to be an image painted onto human bodies, and changes when they move. Or they might be thinking of Wow, and wondering who the real Cesars will vote for on Tuesday.

Title: Nvidia to replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average — Intel's 25-year reign has come to an end

Nvidia's AI leadership and Intel's bungling of its finances leads to this shakeup in the financial world. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia will replace Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicating the massive impact of the AI boom on the semiconductor and tech industries and the entire market. According to CNBC, this change will happen on November 8, about three months after news of Intel's financial woes broke out. The move was sparked by Intel's massive stock price drop—over 30% overnight—following the disastrous financial results released last August. The company has been bleeding cash through its data center and foundry divisions, resulting in a $1.6 billion loss for the second quarter of 2024. This was soon followed by news of massive layoffs, with over 15,000 employees affected. On the other hand, Nvidia’s stock price has been growing by leaps and bounds owing to the AI boom. For a short time, it has become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. Even though the company has dropped down to second place next to Apple, it’s still a remarkable rise in such a short amount of time. Nvidia's share price was $14.16 in November 2022, rising by 218% to $45.01 a year later. Today, the company’s stock price is $135.37, another 201% jump over the past 12 months. This means that the company’s value jumped by over 850% in just two years. Intel entered the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1999, but its 25-year run was cut short by its failure to take the lead in artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Nvidia's replacement would be the fourth tech company worth over a trillion dollars to make it into the Dow, after Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Interestingly, Amazon entered the list just this year after replacing the retail company Walgreens in February. A five-person committee, including editors from the Wall Street Journal, selects the companies to be included in the list. Although there are no specific rules for a company to be considered for the Dow, the committee members consider the following factors when determining which organizations will be added: large market capitalization, industry leadership, sustained financial growth, and investor interest. Nvidia’s entry into the list ticks all these boxes, showing the financial market’s positive outlook on the future of artificial intelligence.

Title: Many proclaimed remote work is here to stay. They couldn't be more wrong as big firms increasingly take a hardline stance

Big Read The timing of recent announcements by companies saying employees must return to the office reflects one possible factor for the trend: When one high-profile business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit, experts say. (Illustration: CNA/ Nurjannah Suhaimi) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Grab’s sudden announcement on Oct 24 that it will be reversing its three-year hybrid work policy and requiring employees to return to office full-time may have caught some people off-guard. But for at least one employee, the writing had been on the wall for some time. The 30-something employee, who wanted to be known only as Ms Sam, said that since the middle of last year, the tech company started asking staff to return to the office more frequently – thrice a week instead of twice. Then, at the start of this year, Grab declared it would take “disciplinary action” against those who were non-compliant, she said. “I had a feeling (full return-to-office) would happen, especially with how Amazon and other tech companies are moving,” Ms Sam told CNA TODAY, referring to the American tech giant's announcement in September mandating working in the office five days a week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in September that by being in office it was "easier to strengthen our culture" and collaboration is made "simpler and more effective". Mr Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, later said that the new policy had received broad support from workers. Amazon’s U-turn on remote and hybrid work – as well as its comply-or-leave ultimatum – was met with strong resistance: This week more than 500 of its employees wrote to Mr Garman urging a reversal of the decision. The letter described the management's explanation for the return-to-office mandate as “non-data-driven” and referred to Mr Garman’s own past comments, when he said the company was running effectively while fully remote. Other big-name employers globally have also taken a strong public stance on employees' physical attendance at the workplace, reversing the remote work trend that many had lauded as the new norm after the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney at the begining of 2023 mandated a return to office for four days a week. In April the same year, JP Morgan asked all its managing directors to return to office every weekday, and other employees thrice a week. In justifying the move, Disney CEO Bob Iger said nothing could replace the ability to connect and co-create when the team is physically together, while JP Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said remote work hinders "spontaneous idea generation". And before them, Elon Musk back in 2022 ordered Tesla and X (at the time still called Twitter) employees to clock in 40 hours in office a week or leave, saying that the creation of great products cannot happen with workers "phoning in". Most recently, it was reported this week that Starbucks recently announced a stricter enforcement of its three-days-in-office policy. From January, employees who do not comply risk losing their jobs. This slew of “back-to-office” mandates comes as a CEO Outlook 2024 Report by professional services firm KPMG published in September found that CEOs are hardening their stance on returning to pre-pandemic ways of working, with 83 per cent of business leaders globally expecting a full return to the office within the next three years. Ms Nicki Doble, principal adviser for corporate transformation, advisory, from professional KPMG in Singapore, said: “We have also seen many employers setting specific benchmarks for the number of days that employees are required to be in office.” This back-to-office fever seems to have reached Singapore’s shores, too, with companies recently asking their employees to work in the office more frequently, if not every day. Data from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) also shows a steady decline in the proportion of companies here offering a scheduled teleworking arrangement – from 56.5 per cent in 2021 to 31.9 per cent last year. Scheduled teleworking refers to an arrangement where employees are allowed to work remotely for an agreed period of time. Companies that do not offer scheduled teleworking arrangements could offer it on an ad-hoc basis or not at all, but no breakdown of such data is available. The number of job vacancies that offer remote work here has also declined, from 35 per cent in 2020 to 21 per cent in 2022, according to MOM's latest figures. All these developments come as recent research offers a mixed picture of how relatively productive work-from-home is compared with traditional working on-site, with some studies noting a tangible drop in productivity when employees work remotely full-time. And while many companies alluded to productivity as a factor when bringing their workers back to the office, human resource and labour experts told CNA TODAY that there may be other explanations for the trend. The timing of the recent spate of announcements points to one factor: When one high-profile company or business leader makes an unpopular move first, it provides a cover of sorts for others to follow suit. Labour economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Walter Theseira said: “Nobody wants to be the first but when there is a wave of companies doing this actually, then that's when you see employers put into place what they wanted to do all along.” It seems contradictory when Singapore has been taking steps to encourage greater acceptance of flexible work arrangements, with the MOM introducing mandatory guidelines that will take effect in December. With work-from-home increasingly viewed by employers as an arrangement that has outlived its purpose, what will these recent developments mean for the future of other flexible work arrangements in Singapore? While a growing number of bosses are taking a tougher stance on employees being physically present in the office, many workers are still unconvinced about the need to do so. Multiple surveys indicate that the majority of workers around the world still prefer to work some days at home. For example, a poll by a US human resource solutions firm Bamboo HR, published in June, found that 42 per cent of American employees who returned to the office say they feel like they are showing up just for visibility. Similarly, a poll done by workplace design and planning firm Unispace found that being perceived as less committed to the job is the top concern about working remotely among employees in Singapore. As many as 36 per cent of employees here expressed this concern, higher than the 31 per cent global average. Meanwhile, a survey of workers and job seekers in Singapore done by human resource solution agency Randstad in late 2023 found that half the respondents said they would leave jobs that require them to work in office more frequently. And it seems that Singapore workers have stronger feelings about remote working compared with their global counterparts, according to a separate study in 2024 by human resource consultancy Mercer: Several employees who were reluctant to return to office full-time told CNA TODAY that they did not feel less productive when working from home. An employee at a multinational cybersecurity firm, who wanted to be known only by her initials TR, said that she and her colleagues feel they are able to do more work at home. “In the office, it's often noisier. People come by your desk to ask you questions, which is very distracting. It's troublesome having to look for available meeting rooms or phone booths, and you have to waste time commuting back and forth every day,” said Ms TR, who is in her 30s. Ever since her company strictly enforced a four-day work-from-office regime early last year, motivation among employees has dropped and some of her colleagues have even left, she added. While productivity and remote working may go hand in hand for employees like Ms TR, some research suggests otherwise. For instance, Forbes reported in August 2023 a 10 per cent to 20 per cent decrease in productivity for fully remote workers, citing a working paper by Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, whose findings were not peer-reviewed. Another paper by the University of Chicago in 2023, based on an analysis of 10,000 skilled professionals in a technology company, reported that productivity fell between 8 per cent and 19 per cent among remote workers. Locally, an analysis by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), published in its October 2023 macroeconomic review, found there was an increase in employees' output. This is as the workers saved time from not having to commute and channeled these savings to work. The analysis noted that there was not enough data to assess the productivity benefits of hybrid work arrangements, which may differ from pure remote work. And while hybrid working – which combines remote work with in-office work – has been touted as offering the best of both worlds, it also comes with its own set of challenges, according to professional networking platform LinkedIn. “Our latest survey reveals that over one-third of professionals in Singapore are struggling to communicate efficiently in hybrid work environments,” said Ms Feon Ang, managing director for LinkedIn APAC. In the meantime, co-working spaces have evolved their offerings as demand for office space increases. JustCo, for example, saw a 19 per cent increase in enquiries – from both individuals and companies – between January and October this year as compared with the same period in 2023. "While companies in Singapore are increasingly asking employees to return to office, there will likely still be an uptick in demand for flexible workspaces," said a spokesperson. Catering to this trend, the firm launched JustCo SuperPass in June last year, a cost-saving plan that allows companies to grant office access to additional employees on an ad-hoc basis without paying for long-term workstations. The seemingly short-lived enthusiasm for remote working among employers comes at a notable juncture in Singapore, as the government is making strides to encourage flexible work arrangements amid perennial concerns about the nation’s tight labour market, ageing workforce and the fact that more workers are taking on caregiving roles at home. In April, MOM announced that all employers must have a process in place for workers to make formal requests for flexible work arrangements from December, when new tripartite guidelines come into effect. While employers have the right to reject such requests, the decision should be backed up by reasonable business grounds such as cost or productivity considerations, the ministry said. Given how many companies said during the pandemic that their remote working arrangements were not affecting productivity, the recent and sudden about-turn by a series of big employers raises one big question: Why now? From cost considerations to reducing headcount to promoting staff integration, these are some of the reasons cited by human resource and business experts as well as companies themselves for doing away with remote working in the past year or so: Both Amazon and Grab, in announcing their return-to-office mandates, said in-person collaboration, as observed during hybrid work arrangements, had been beneficial for the company. And so, to further enhance this, the companies decided to double down on the number of days in office. Group CEO of recruitment firm Reeracoen, Kenji Naito, noted: “For some roles, particularly where immediate responses are required or tasks aren’t easily measured, working from the office facilitates more streamlined communication.” Such interaction is even more important for small and young companies. Mr Bryan Tay, Singapore country manager for fintech platform Lendela, said: “We need to create a culture from scratch and cultivate trust, understanding, and a deep belief in our mission, which is much harder to do over a screen.” Lendela was founded in 2018 and currently has over 50 employees in Singapore and other markets. Since its founding, it has practised full-time work from the office, except during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Being together in the office allows us to build stronger connections, share ideas organically, engage in real-time problem-solving, and respond quickly to opportunities and challenges,” said Mr Tay. It is normal for companies to constantly review their policies and strategies from time to time, including those relating to employee location, said experts. Economist Song Seng Wun said that companies would have had hired workers during or soon after the pandemic. With the growing number of employees who have not had a chance to meet each other in person regularly, it may be an added impetus for some companies now to call them back into the office. “Workers come and go. Ultimately companies don’t want a situation where their employees are working with people they have never or hardly met,” said Mr Song, economic adviser for financial service provider CGS International. Mr Naito of Reeracoen added: “We've observed that junior employees with less experience and employees without clearly defined quantitative targets may face challenges working remotely. “Junior employees often require more direct supervision and mentorship, which can be limited in remote settings.” One often-heard argument for maintaining flexible working arrangements is that a company that fails to do so risks losing good employees. “However, some companies might see this as an opportunity to streamline their workforce, which could align with their goals of optimising headcount,” said Mr Lewis Garrad, partner and career business leader for Mercer Asia. Interestingly, some of the companies calling their workers back to office, such as Grab, Disney and Amazon, are also those that have recently made headlines for retrenchment exercises. Indeed, one of Amazon’s top executives reportedly told employees that if they had problems complying with the mandatory return to office policy, “there are other companies around”. Bamboo HR’s survey in June found that a quarter of vice-presidents and C-suite executives and 18 per cent of HR professionals surveyed in the US admitted hoping for “some voluntary turnover” when they implemented mandatory return-to-office policies. But experts also noted that a forced return to office policy may be too blunt a tool to trim headcount. Assoc Prof Theseira said some companies may see it as "not necessarily a bad thing" to lose employees who are unwilling to return to office and whom they perceive as less committed. "But there is this argument that they might be losing their best staff, because their best staff have the ability to quit and then find a job elsewhere," he said. Experts added that many other factors influence a company’s decision to mandate a return to office. While some argue that enforcing office-based work would drive away talent, Lendela told CNA TODAY that its retention rate this year so far is 88 per cent across all its offices, and 87.5 per cent for the Singapore office. By comparison, a poll by market research firm IPSOS in January found about three in 10 workers in Singapore intend to leave their employers within two years. A separate study by professional services firm EY in July 2023 found 45 per cent of workers here had plans to change jobs within a year. In Lendela's latest monthly employee satisfaction survey – done anonymously and online – its workers gave an average rating of 86 per cent in terms of happiness. Meanwhile over at another startup BigFundr, which also stopped practising remote work after the COVID-19 period, one employee, Mr Imran Johri, found work-from-office a refreshing change from the purely remote arrangement in his old company. “Those work-from-home years were the most challenging for me (in terms of productivity) as I have three young children who simply see my presence as the licence for constant engagement,” said Mr Imran, who is marketing director at BigFundr. Nonetheless, he admitted that a hybrid arrangement would be ideal, as it would allow him to meet his caregiving responsibilities for his children and family too. Some experts highlighted the high real estate costs here as an additional motivation for companies to bring their workers back to the office to “justify” their spending on rents. “The high cost of office space in Singapore means companies with large offices may feel the need to bring employees back to fully use their space,” said Mr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy, Asia, at Unispace Singapore. “The cost of keeping empty offices can push businesses to focus on in-office work, making it a financial decision as well as a cultural one.” While companies make their own calculations in setting any policy or strategy, it is also normal for them to take a look at what others in the industry are doing and take that into consideration. Ms Shalynn Ler, Singapore general manager for recruitment firm Ethos BeathChapman, noted that companies are operating under great economic uncertainty and face huge pressures from shareholders. “It is easy in such circumstances to be very reactive and herd mentality sets in, where companies start to mirror what other big firms and industry leaders are doing,” she said. Assoc Prof Theseira of SUSS said that it “seems true anecdotally” that if a certain big company does something, then a smaller one would tend to follow suit as well. It also applies to measures that are seen as unpopular but otherwise financially necessary – such as retrenching workers, raising prices of products, or even changing work practices. “The natural tendency of management globally is always to do it, because they are looking after the bottom line. But it's just that the company may not want to do this (yet), if they are going to be the first,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. Ms Ang from LinkedIn noted that businesses globally are “facing headwinds and rapid change”, prompting companies to reconsider a whole range of decisions, from investments to operations. Though the latest MOM figures indicate that although the labour market in Singapore is tight – the unemployment rate is low and there is a scarcity of workers to fill roles – sentiment has been bleak. Retrenchments more than doubled in 2023 from the year before. Earlier this year, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the labour movement said they were expecting more layoffs until the end of 2024. Furthermore, as more organisations adopt work-from-office as the default arrangement, even if there are more jobs available, employees seeking flexible options may have fewer choices, according to some experts. “This trend could potentially decrease the bargaining power of workers who prefer remote or hybrid models,” said Mr David Blasco, country director at Randstad Singapore. Simply put, companies which want to revoke work-from-home benefits may have to worry less about their employees leaving. Ms Sam from Grab said that her salary lags behind her peers, but the flexible work arrangement has “somewhat made up for it – or at least delayed my departure”. She intends to leave, but it may not be so straightforward now. “And I think the company knows this as well, the job market isn’t that great. So maybe many of us won’t be able to find better options anyway,” she said. As much as the launch of flexi-work guidelines by MOM seems a step in the right direction, experts pointed out that companies can quite easily reject employees' requests for these arrangements with simple and general justifications, such as by saying that they need all workers to work in the office full-time due to operational reasons. “There is an overarching concern that the framework's reliance on employer goodwill and competitive pressure, rather than strict enforcement, could limit its impact,” said Mr Blasco of Randstad. In response to queries after the guidelines were announced, MOM said that errant companies would be counselled and be given warnings if they do not consider their employees’ flexi-work requests fairly. Mr Blasco said what may be a bigger deterrent to companies considering a full turnabout from remote or hybrid work arrangements is the potential reputational cost. “Ultimately, the organisation's policies will significantly shape its culture and long-term reputation," he said. He added that given how any negative perception of a company can be “particularly stubborn to change”, it would benefit the companies to really think through their workplace policies before implementing them. Some companies currently operating in the office full-time, like the startup BigFundr, are well aware of this. “It is with that in mind that we are now looking into our version of a more flexible work arrangement,” said its founder and CEO Quah Kay Beng. He added that they are “keen to allow for (flexi-work) to be part of our work culture” as soon as the company of 14 employees grows in size and efficiency. Experts also generally agreed that even as some companies require their employees to return to office, it does not mean the end of flexible work arrangements. “The initial enthusiasm for 100 per cent remote work may evolve into more nuanced approaches to flexible work that are better suited to each company’s operational needs,” said Mr Naito of Reeracoen. Ms Ler of Ethos BeathChapman said in the long term, the future of flexi-work arrangements in Singapore would also be influenced by the norms of the bigger economic markets such as the United States, United Kingdom and China. “If it becomes more common in those bigger economies globally for employers to revert to offer-based work policy, for instance, Singapore will likely follow suit,” she added. Furthermore, if Singapore excels in flexible-work arrangements, it could serve as a competitive advantage for the nation. The experts noted that the MOM guidelines, though not legally binding, signals that the government recognises the importance of flexi-work arrangements. Thus, it is unlikely that such arrangements will disappear entirely in the future. And even if companies believe they can afford to scale back on certain flexible work arrangements now, they are likely to reevaluate their position once the job market cycle shifts and becomes more of an employee's market again, and they face challenges in attracting talent in the future, experts said. The economists also noted that the labour market is cyclical – it may favour employers for a period of time, but will return to being an employees' market when talents become scarce and companies have to compete with each other for headcount. “It wouldn't be surprising if at some point in the future, you have one market player doing this big, flashy (flexi-work) thing and say: 'We offer all this hybrid work and so on, as an attempt to recruit people’,” said Assoc Prof Theseira.

Title: DC making contingent plans for INTEL crisis...
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/11/01/2024/concerns-grow-in-washington-over-intel
Time Published: 2024-11-01T19:00:03Z
Full Content:
Policymakers in Washington have grown worried enough about chipmaker Intel to begin quietly discussing scenarios should it need further assistance, beyond the billions in government funds the company is already slated to receive, people familiar with the matter said. A strong quarterly earnings outlook yesterday bought the company breathing room with investors, but abstract concerns in Washington have turned into potential backup options, should Intelâs finances continue to deteriorate. Top officials at the Commerce Department, which oversees implementation of the CHIPS Act funding to reinvigorate American chip production, and members of Congress including Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lawâs leading champions, have discussed whether the company needs more help, the people said. The talks, which the people described as purely precautionary, show that Intel is seen as too strategically important to be allowed to fall into serious trouble. The US is seeking a national champion in the semiconductor space to ensure its own supply chain and as a counterweight to China, where manufacturing for global chips has moved. âWe have outlined a clear strategy that we are executing with rigor, and the strong operational performance we delivered in Q3 demonstrates important progress against our plan,â an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. âIntel is the only American company that designs and manufactures leading-edge chips and is playing a critical role to enable a globally competitive semiconductor ecosystem in the US.â One option is a merger, led by the private sector but possibly encouraged by the government, of Intelâs chip-design business with a rival like AMD or Marvell, the people said. Thereâs little appetite for a 2008-style bailout, in which the government took direct stakes in automakers and banks, because policymakers are worried about losing money given Intelâs continued sales declines. Intel is set to be the biggest recipient of government funding under the CHIPS Act, which aims to help American manufacturers of key tech components build their products in the US and compete with China. The company is slated to receive $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in low-interest loans; these funds would not be part of any further assistance, should Intel need one. But Intel hasnât received any of that CHIPS money yet amid doubts about its prospects. Bloomberg reported that the company has been reluctant to share certain information sought by US officials tasked with ensuring that the company has a viable turnaround plan. Intel suspended its dividend in August to preserve cash and said it would lay off about 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-cutting effort. It is the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, after Walgreens. Credit ratings agencies downgraded the chipmaker this summer, increasing its borrowing costs. On Thursday, Intel reported a $16.6 billion net loss largely due to writedowns and other restructuring charges and updated its planned layoffs, increasing them by about 10% to 16,500 employees. But it gave a better-than-expected revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, and shares rose 6% on Friday morning. On Intelâs earnings call Thursday, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is on track to begin producing its most advanced chips, known as 18A, next year. Intel is different from other US chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm because it has always built its chips at its own facilities, known as âfabs,â instead of outsourcing production to Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere. But Intel made strategic mistakes, causing it to fall behind rivals. With CHIPS Act funding, the US aimed to encourage Intel to revitalize its production capabilities. A successful launch of the 18A generation chip â something many in the industry doubted the company could pull off â would put Intel back on par with industry leader TSMC. Amazon last month made a multi-billion-dollar commitment to buy a new custom-designed AI chip from Intel that will be built using the 18A process. And on the earnings call Thursday, Gelsinger said two more âcompute-centric companiesâ have agreed to use 18A. âWe have confidence in Intelâs overall vision for manufacturing chips in the United States,â a Commerce Department spokesperson said âWe continue to work closely with the company to finalize their award and will provide further updates as they become available.â Warnerâs office declined to comment. Gina Chon contributed to this report In this article: Itâs surprising Intel stayed at the top of the market as long as it did. It set the rules of its own game with co-founder Gordon Mooreâs âlawâ that the number of semiconductors on a chip will double about every two years. That was in the 1960s. It still has nearly 80% market share for CPUs a half century later. But like many big, old companies, Intel had trouble staying ahead of younger, more nimble competitors. It failed to adapt to changes in the chip industry and fell victim to the innovatorâs dilemma. It makes sense for the US government to try to salvage the situation and to prop up a ânational championâ in the chip space. America is in a high stakes race for technological superiority over China, which subsidizes its private-sector efforts. Bringing chip production âfabsâ back to the US solves the immediate dilemma of supply chain vulnerabilities and the possibility of China taking control of TSMCâs Taiwan headquarters, where most of the worldâs leading-edge chips are manufactured. The longer term problem is that the US government forgot how to spearhead innovation in key areas. For instance, itâs ironic that one of Intelâs competitive threats is from Arm-based processors, which are slowly gaining market share in PCs and data centers. Arm is based on an architecture called Reduced Instruction Set Computer, or RISC. DARPA spearheaded its development by funding a nascent research project at UC Berkeley in the 1970s. It ultimately became one of the seminal breakthroughs in that era of computer science. Arm (Advanced RISC Machines), was co-founded in the UK by Apple and Acorn Computers in 1990. It became essentially the foundation for most of the microprocessors in your life, from your car to your smartphone. There is now even an Arm China. The open system that allows US innovation to prop up non-US competitors only works if the US keeps innovating. The question is whether the government â hampered by divisive politics â can produce the next Intel, or the next RISC-based processor. Or the next breakthrough in lithography to leapfrog current semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett argued last week that splitting up Intel makes no sense: âWeâve seen this movie before. Years ago, a struggling AMD split off its manufacturing capacity into Global Foundries. Pundits applauded the split at the time. A decade later, AMD is doing well using TSMC, while Global Foundries has little if any differentiated technology. Global Foundries just didnât have enough research and development (R&D) budget, and with limited production and revenue, struggled to keep up with market leaders. The economic reality is that it takes massive investment to drive Mooreâs Law. In todayâs semiconductor industry, only three companies (Intel, Samsung, and TSMC) have sufficient revenue to contend for technology leadership. If you split up Intel, the foundry portion will probably fail because of decreased R&D spending along with the complex realities of splitting up a huge multinational company in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort.â âIntel is on the verge of completing an unprecedented pace of node development to catch up to TSMC. It has taken the lead on next-gen technologies that will shape the semiconductor industry for years to come, such as high NA EUV lithography and backside power delivery. Yes, more work is neededâbut this is a good start, and they must keep going.â Intelâs wobbles may force Washington to choose between two of its ideological priorities: promoting national champions and preventing corporate consolidation. On a clear day, thereâs little chance antitrust regulators would allow Intel to merge with any of its rivals. Expediency often forces policy compromises â see JPMorganâs emergency rescue of First Republic last year â but if Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo can outmuscle Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, it will show just how deep Intelâs problems run.

Title: AI drives a cloud resurgence, but it’s costing a lot

UPDATED 13:18 EST / NOVEMBER 01 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Generative artificial intelligence is driving a resurgence in cloud spending, as earnings results from Amazon Web Services and Google this week both saw upside from forecasts. Even Microsoft’s disappointing Azure revenue forecasts came from not having enough infrastructure to support more business, a factor Amazon CEO Andy Jassy also mentioned — and excessive demand isn’t a bad problem to have, as problems go. But at the same time, there’s a big price: Spending to keep up with AI demand continues to be expensive, as Meta’s results also showed this week. Meanwhile, money keeps pouring into AI companies such as Elon Musk’s xAI and Bret Taylor’s AI agent startup Sierra Technologies as well as more industry- and task-specific startups. And new AI models and services keep getting churned out from OpenAI, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Salesforce and everyone else you can think of, with no slowdown in sight. The big one this week: OpenAI’s much-anticipated ChatGPT search. I’m sure it will be interesting, but don’t be ridiculous, it’s not going to put Google out of business anytime soon. Intel got a rare boost by reporting a more positive quarter and outlook than expected and its stock rose 10%, though it remains in a deep hole — another sign of which was Nvidia replacing it on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today. But AMD’s outlook sent investors to the exits. Supermicro’s financial situation looks so bad to its auditors that they exited stage left, tanking the server provider’s stock to the tune of 33%. Its earnings report next week should be … interesting. Indeed, next week is another big week for earnings reports, especially from chip companies such as Arm, Qualcomm, NXP Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries, as well as bellwethers such as Cloudflare and Datadog and a raft of software-as-a-service companies. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend, for some lean-back reading. Here’s what happened this week around the enterprise: On big data: At TechCrunch Disrupt, there was a illuminating session called Beyond Snowflake and Databricks: Insights from the Frontlines of Data Transformation that indicated the big-data wars will continue for a while longer. One reality, noted Jordan Tigani, co-founder and CEO of MotherDuck, which makes a cloud analytics database, is that “AI people and database people tend not to like each other very much. We’re going to need new tools to power AI/ML engineers.” And the open data formats that Snowflake and Databricks are ostensibly touting? “Things are moving more slowly toward these open data formats than people expect,” he said. “Catalogs are a mess right now. Snowflake and Databricks are slow-walking the building of the open-source versions.” As a result, he said, “the community needs to be stronger” in getting providers to become more open. “The reason people are moving to Iceberg is to remove lock-in or just lower cost,” he said, but both of those reasons are “lower priorities than other things,” like just getting the jobs at hand done. In fact, contended Colin Zima, co-founder and CEO of the business intelligence platform Omni, Snowflake and Databricks “will actually diverge further over time. Databricks is underinvested in all the analytics problems and Snowflake will struggle to become an AI company. It’s very hard to overhaul your DNA.” On what’s coming next in AI: At Constellation Research’s CCE 2024 conference, the firm’s analysts weighed in on the next impacts of AI. VP and Principal Analyst Doug Henschen noted that only 21% of enterprises they surveyed are meeting their goals for generative AI. The problem, he said, is a lack of data, in particular clean data. “Data access and cleansing will be key in 2025.” Constellation Insights Editor in Chief Larry Dignan says generative and agentic AI are starting to transform the enterprise software business model. “In the next year or so, the whole way you buy software is going to change,” he said. Andy Thurai sees a lot of companies cutting corners on making sure AI is under control. “AI will produce AI to monitor itself. There’s no going back if that happens,” he said. “Lawyers are going to have a field day.” Liz Miller noted that “the lesson we’ve learned over the last several years of generative AI is when you automate bad processes, you still have bad processes.” She thinks “knowledge” will be the next frontier in 2025, not just big data. “Right now we’re drowning in data but dying of thirst,” she said. Constellation founder Ray Wang said the key question coming is at what points in AI-driven processes that humans get inserted. They all did a lightning poll on AI budgets next year and, surprisingly, most said AI budgets will be flat or worse. Did someone say trough of disillusionment? But others such as Barney Pell, venture partner at Radical Ventures, are more optimistic. “This time it’s real in a way it hasn’t been,” he said about AI. But he sees the proper focus not on artificial general intelligence but humans plus AI — and also neural networks plus symbolic systems, not just gen AI. The biggest issue? trust. “Most enterprise projects fail because no one trusts them,” he said. One promising avenue I touched on a bit in last week’s This Week in Enterprise came up again in a somewhat different way: the need for AI systems to be trained on more than just language. Denise Hold, founder and CEO of AIX Global Media, a sort of AI startup promoter, said spatial web technologies that are programmable, based on sensory information, are being developed to create a “grounding level of reality.” AI adviser Cassie Kozyrkov had the quote of the week, on the difference between machine learning and AI: “If it’s written in Python, it’s probably machine learning. If it’s in a PowerPoint, it’s AI.” Breaking Analysis: Generative AI adoption sets the table for AI ROI Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly in talks to raise new funding on $40B valuation Insider raises $500M in funding for its personalized marketing platform Generative AI agent startup Sierra Technologies raises $175M at $4.5B valuation Read AI lands $50M in new funding as it strives to become everyone’s AI copilot AI contact center provider Regal closes $40M round to scale personalized customer interactions Zenity raises $38M to secure enterprise AI copilots and low-code app development Brightwave raises $15M to accelerate financial research with AI Diffblue raises $6.3M for autonomous AI-powered test generation platform Report: Chinese researchers used Llama 13B to build chatbot optimized for military use OSI clarifies what makes AI systems open-source, but most ‘open’ models fall short White House limits AI and chip investments to China over national security concerns Nvidia needs EU approval to buy AI startup Run:ai, regulators say OpenAI adds LLM-powered search engine to ChatGPT Apple releases first batch of Apple Intelligence features, debuts new iMac Alexa AI upgrade delayed to 2025 as Amazon hits major roadblocks GitHub Copilot goes multimodel, adding support for Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude LLMs Salesforce launches Agentforce AI agent platform into general availability Nvidia hands out blueprints for the creation of scalable ‘AI factories’ Google reportedly developing new AI that can automate web browsing tasks in Chrome Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features Meta reportedly developing custom search engine for its Meta AI chatbot Amazon Q introduces AI-powered inline chat directly in the code editor for developers Dremio throws its support to Polaris data catalog and expands deployment options for Iceberg lakehouse Pegasystems moves the needle on generative AI development with Pega Infinity updates Creatio combines multiple AI types in new release of its no-code platform Moveworks taps agentic AI to aid in enterprise search Patronus AI debuts API for equipping AI workloads with reliability guardrails TigerEye’s new AI Analyst offers enhanced decision-making in sales and revenue operations Securiti launches Genstack AI to enhance secure enterprise generative AI adoption Tabnine unveils AI developer ‘coach’ with personalized code review agent There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Alphabet’s stock jumps as cloud fuels strong revenue growth Also: Russia hits Google with astronomical fine over YouTube bans That’s a lotta rubles.

Title: Prime Day boosts Amazon sales, membership in Q3

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Product sales were strong, but third-party seller services, advertising and subscriptions grew by double digits in the period. Spurred in part by its summertime Prime Day sale, Amazon on Thursday reported that Q3 online store sales rose 7.2% year over year to $61.4 billion and physical-store sales rose 5.4% to $5.2 billion. Growth of services in the e-commerce giant’s retail business was especially solid. Product sales grew 7% to $67.6 billion, while third-party seller services rose 10.3% to $37.9 billion, advertising grew 18.8% to $14.3 billion and subscriptions grew 10.9% to $11.3 billion. The giant AWS cloud services business, which underpins Amazon’s profitability, helped drive net income growth of more than 55% to $15.3 billion, per a company press release. Several analysts took note of the robust operating margins in Amazon’s Q3 report. At Amazon’s cloud unit, which is benefiting from AI and all its potential, operating margin topped 38%. But, while AWS and its international segment posted all-time highs in that metric, there were strong operating margins across the company’s business segments in the third quarter, according to research from William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden. Operating margins were also given a boost by Amazon’s layoffs in recent years. Though most cuts were made about a year ago, workforce reductions continued into this year, including at AWS and in customer service, warehouse operations and Buy with Prime. Based on their job postings monitor, UBS analysts deem the margin upside from a leaner headcount “durable,” according to a Friday client note. There were also other strengths in retail. For example, the 7% product-sales expansion was the best growth in six months, boosted by summer’s Prime Day, according to emailed comments from GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. “This is always a big event for Amazon but, despite even tougher competition from other retailers jumping aboard the discount bandwagon, Amazon remained the focal point and pulled in more shoppers than ever,” he said. “Some of this is down to consumers being more receptive to discounts, but some is also because Amazon has fine-tuned the deals it offers to ensure they are relevant and compelling. This aids conversion.” The company’s Prime membership “remains a core contributor to this growth,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts Thursday, noting that Prime Day boosted paid membership growth, which accelerated in the U.S. and abroad in Q3. While AI is critical to the progress at AWS, Amazon also touted AI-powered initiatives in retail, including shopping tool Rufus, which rolled out to U.S. customers earlier this year and is becoming available in Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and the U.K.; shopping guides that simplify product search; Project Amelia, an AI assistant for sellers; and video generation and live image capabilities for advertisers. Perhaps even more important to Amazon’s retail operation is its refinements in fulfillment and delivery, increasingly aided by robotics. Improved inventory placement in Q3 helped drive down costs in the company’s fulfillment network, which led to “better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box,” Olsavsky said. “The reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us ... to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today,” he said, noting that in a new Shreveport, Louisiana, facility the company now has “very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow.” In retail, Amazon is also benefiting somewhat from “some of the slip-ups of other retailers in more essential categories, such as locking up products or deteriorating the store experience,” according to Saunders. Customer service, curation and other aspects of a good store experience are crucial to insulating retailers from the stiff competition from Amazon, experts say. That’s true not just of specialty retail but also everyday goods, Saunders said. “While it is only happening at the margins, these things are pushing more people to shop for everyday products on Amazon — with many of these new converts becoming regular and loyal customers in essentials categories,” he said.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Alphabet executives, donning Halloween costumes, faced questions from concerned employees at an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, following comments on the company’s earnings call suggesting that more cost cuts are coming. “There is a reality to it,” said Brian Ong, vice president of Google recruiting, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by CNBC. “We are hiring less than we did a couple of years ago.” Ong, who was specifically responding to a question about retention and promotion opportunities, added that fewer positions are open and geographic hiring has changed, “so you may see fewer roles available where you are.” A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The meeting came after Alphabet reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue Tuesday, sparking a rally in the stock. On a call with investors, CFO Anat Ashkenazi, who recently succeeded Ruth Porat, proclaimed she wanted to “push a little further” with cost savings across the company. Google’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wore a starfish costume to the meeting, while Ashkenazi sported a jersey of former Indiana Pacers star Reggie Miller. CEO Sundar Pichai wore a black t-shirt that read “ERROR 404 COSTUME NOT FOUND” with an image of a pixelated dinosaur. Ashkenazi said one of her key priorities in the new role would be to make more cuts as Google expands its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure in 2025. It’s a theme that began in 2023, when the economy and market turned, and has continued since. Google has been restructuring its workforce to move more quickly in the AI arms race, where it faces increased competition. That’s included layoffs, organizational shake-ups, and has led to workers feeling a “decline in morale,” as CNBC previously reported. Over the last couple of months, Google has made cuts to its marketing, cloud and security teams in Silicon Valley, as well as in its trust and safety unit. Google is far from alone. Dropbox this week announced it will lay off 20% of its global workforce, while Amazon continues shuttering various projects. Within Google, employees have expressed concern that the company is preparing for more layoffs, possibly after the end of the year, according to internal correspondence viewed by CNBC. Pichai joked that the quarterly call was perfect preparation for Ashkenazi ahead of the company meeting. “I was telling Anat yesterday, earnings calls are a piece of cake compared to TGIF the next day,” Pichai said, to laughs from attendees. Some employee comments and questions included praise for “another great quarter,” success in chip advancements and improvements in Google’s hit AI note-taking tool NotebookLM. However, other questions expressed fear of what greater cost efficiencies would mean for the workforce. “What exactly was meant by the comments on further efficiencies in headcount”? one question asked, pointing to Ashkenazi’s comments from the call. Ashkenazi didn’t share any more details but said employees are “one of the most important assets we have.” She said that the company is investing in people and that it hired 1,000 new graduates in the third quarter. Pichai, who’s been preaching efficiency for almost two years, chimed in to echo past sentiment. “If you have to do something new and it’s going to take 10 people, if you can find a way to do it with eight people by making smart trade-offs somewhere and aligning teams better, that’s an example of finding efficiencies in headcount as well,” Pichai said. In response to another question about ongoing layoffs and reorganizations and what might be coming in the future, Pichai said, “If we are making companywide decisions, we’ll definitely let you know.” He said the company is spending heavily on AI at the moment, but the need to ramp up those expenses won’t last forever. “We are going through an extraordinary period of capex advancement,” Pichai said. “When you have these technology shifts, at the earlier stages, you invest disproportionately and then the curve gets better and that’s the transition as an industry we are working through.” He added that not all of the cuts are decided on by top executives. “It’s not like all of these decisions are centrally done at a company level,” he said. “And so, at the scale of our company, there could be moments where there are small groups of people impacted.” Ashkenazi on Tuesday mentioned that one way to get more cost efficiency is by using AI internally. The company said 25% of new code is now generated by AI. In response to a question about productivity, Brian Saluzzo, head of “Core” developers, said that while the 25% refers to low-level tasks, leadership is in the midst of “expanding to more complex areas” within the company. “Core” refers to the teams that build the technical foundation underlying Google’s flagship products. In May, CNBC reported that Google laid off more than 200 employees from its Core engineering teams, in a reorganization that included rehiring some roles in India and Mexico. Pichai followed up by saying, “In this transition moment, across all functions, everywhere in the company, it’s worth challenging us to think where we can use AI to be more productive.” He added that through 2025, the workforce should “strive to do more” and “help customers around the world take those learnings as well.” Jennifer covers Google parent company Alphabet Inc. and Silicon Valley culture for CNBC.com in San Francisco. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Report: Big Media Companies Are Increasing Their Spending On Content

According to a report from Ampere Analytics, over half of all content spending in 2024 will come ... [+] from six companies. Disney leads in total content investments. Netflix ranks first with spending on streaming content. Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Earlier this week, Ampere Analytics, a U.K.-based research and analytics company focusing on media and content released its latest report on content spending. Among the key findings was the combined spending of six companies; Disney, Comcast, Google (YouTube), Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and Paramount Global content spend will total $126 billion in 2024, a year-over-year increase of +9%. In a first, the six companies will now account for over half (50.6%) of total content spending. By comparison, last year, the six companies accounted for 47.5% of content spend. With reports the era of Peak TV, which saw a steady increase in the number of original scripted programming had peaked; Ampere reports that since 2022 spending on original content from the six companies had totaled $56 billion, accounting for 45% of total spending. Peter Ingram, research manager at Ampere Analysis said, “We can expect that the content landscape will see low-level growth in 2024 as production schedules recover from disruptions caused by the pandemic and the writers’ and actors’ union strikes.” Ingram added, “Looking forward however, overall growth in spend is set to plateau as companies look to refocus their output. This will include limiting commissioning volumes and prioritizing strategic investments and profitability to counter the current challenges of the media market.” Ampere found as viewers migrate away from linear television that content companies are investing more on their streaming platforms. This year $40 billion will be invested on streaming including content from Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ accounting for nearly one-third (32%) of the total spend. Among the six companies Disney is the top spender on global content. In 2024 Disney is expected to spend $35.8 billion accounting for 14.4% of the total. Earlier this year, Disney’s attained total ownership of Hulu after negotiations with Comcast were finalized. The addition of Hulu added an estimated $9 billion in content spend. Furthermore, Disney continues to be the largest provider of television and film content worldwide accounting for 14% of the total. For the year, Comcast ranked second in content spend at $24.5 billion (9.9% of total spend) Google ranked third at $17.6 billion 7.1%), followed by Warner Bros. Discovery at $16.8 billion (6.8%). In a reversal from last year, Netflix will now rank fifth with $16.0 billion (6.4%) surpassing Paramount Global at $15.1 billion (6.1%). Ampere noted that Paramount’s investment in original; content has slowed this year. In addition, non-U.S. original content will account for 40% of Paramount+ and 52% for Netflix. Production costs outside the U.S. tend to be lower. Earlier in the year Ampere reported Netflix and Amazon over a full quarter had ordered more than half of their titles from outside the U.S. Ampere noted since the pandemic, Netflix has become the leading content spender among streaming platforms with an average investment of $14.5 billion per annum. The dollars are expected to increase as Netflix has invested in live sports. Starting this year through 2026, Netflix will be live streaming an NFL Christmas Day doubleheader. Also, next year, Netflix will become the new home of WWE Raw. The report noted that Google’s content investment is derived from YouTube and investment in programming via their revenue-sharing arrangements with content creators. While different from other content investors, the streaming platform has been building a strong presence globally in agreements with major content providers. As a result, YouTube has emerged as the third largest content spender. The increase in content spending comes at a time when several streaming services launched during the pandemic are starting to become profitable or at least have cut their losses. The increase in content spending also coincides at a time when several media companies, looking to cut their losses, have been cutting back on other units including a series of personnel layoffs.

Title: Stock market today: Microsoft, Meta and the burden of expectations knock Wall Street sharply lower

Drops for Big Tech companies including Microsoft and Facebook's parent company Meta Platforms led Wall Street lower NEW YORK -- The downside of high expectations thumped Wall Street on Thursday, and Microsoft and Meta Platforms dragged U.S. stock indexes lower despite delivering strong profits for the summer. The S&P 500 sank 1.9% for its worst day in eight weeks and fell further from its record set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 378 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% for a second straight loss after setting its latest all-time high. Microsoft reported bigger profit growth for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped forecasts, but its stock nevertheless sank 6% as investors and analysts scoured for possible disappointments. Many centered on Microsoft’s estimate for upcoming growth in its Azure cloud-computing business, which fell short of some analysts’ expectations. The parent company of Facebook, meanwhile, likewise served up a better-than-expected profit report. As with Microsoft, that wasn’t enough to boost its stock. Investors focused instead on Meta Platforms’ warning that it expects a “significant acceleration” in spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing artificial intelligence. It fell 4.1%. Both Microsoft and Meta Platforms have soared in recent years amid a frenzy around AI, and they’re entrenched among Wall Street’s most influential stocks. But such stellar performances have critics saying their stock prices have simply climbed too fast, leaving them too expensive. It’s difficult to meet everyone’s expectations when they’re so high, and Microsoft and Meta were both among Thursday’s heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Amazon and Apple also helped drag the market lower, with Amazon falling 3.4% and Apple dropping 2% before they released their profit reports after trading ended for the day. They’re the latest companies in the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to do so. Earlier this month, Tesla and Alphabet kicked off the Magnificent Seven’s reports with results that investors found impressive enough to reward with higher stock prices. The lone remaining member, Nvidia, will report its results later this earnings season, and its 4.8% drop was Thursday’s heaviest weight on the market after Microsoft. Expectations are just as high for the chip company after its stock soared over 880% in the last two years. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the last six, even though it set an all-time high during the middle of it. Such a big move might have been overdue following an unusually long and placid run, according to Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. He pointed to how the S&P 500 had failed to move by 1% in a day in either direction, without accounting for rounding, for the longest stretch in nearly three years. Still, Thursday wasn’t a complete washout thanks in part to cruise ships and cigarettes. Norwegian Cruise Line Holding steamed 6.3% higher after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cruise ship operator said it was seeing strong demand from customers across its brands and itineraries, and it raised its profit forecast for the full year of 2024. Altria Group rose 7.8% for another one of the S&P 500’s bigger gains after beating analysts’ profit expectations. Chief Executive Billy Gifford credited resilience for its Marlboro brand, among other things, and announced a cost-cutting initiative. Oil-and-gas companies also rose after the price of a barrel of U.S. crude gained 0.9% to recoup some of its losses for the week and for the year so far. ConocoPhillips jumped 6.4%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 108.22 points to 5,705.45. The Dow dropped 378.08 to 41,736.46, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 512.78 to 18,095.15. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends after ignoring food and energy costs were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields swiveled up and down several times following the reports before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of last month. Yields have been rising following a string of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. Such data bolster hopes that the economy can avoid a recession, particularly now that the Fed is cutting interest rates to support the job market instead of keeping them high to quash high inflation. But the surprising resilience is also forcing traders to downgrade their expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes sank across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.5% for one of the larger losses after North Korea test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to hit the U.S. mainland in a move that was likely meant to grab America’s attention ahead of Election Day. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech’s latest earnings show the AI spending spree isn’t over

Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…Big Tech is increasing AI spending… OpenAI drops its foundry ambitions… Wall Street boosts AI infrastructure… and AI models give inaccurate voting info. Quarterly earnings are in for Microsoft, Meta, and Google, with Amazon’s on the way tonight. Those who reported so far made one thing clear: They’re about to amp up spending on AI even more. Of course, most of this investment will go to infrastructure like Nvidia chips and data centers. Nvidia isn’t set to announce its Q3 earnings for another month, but it will be another telling one to watch for the pulse on the AI boom. Meta said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 as it accelerates its infrastructure investments. The company raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion. “Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call yesterday. Meta is currently working on the next version of its Llama model and is continuing to position itself as an AI company—all while relying on ad revenue from its social media platforms to foot the bill. To bridge the gap, Zuckerberg framed AI as a win for its core ad business. He said its advancements in AI are making it possible to better predict what content users want to see, leading to 8% and 6% increases in time spent on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Microsoft posted positive growth for its AI business, reporting that it’s on track to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue run rate in the current quarter and will be its fastest product category to reach that milestone yet. Additionally, the company disclosed details of its investment in OpenAI for the first time in a quarterly regulatory filing, painting a picture of massive losses on the other side of its AI bet. In the filing, Microsoft stated it’s made $13 billion in total commitments to OpenAI. This, however, didn’t include the additional $750 million the company reportedly invested in OpenAI’s latest funding round at the beginning of October (the filing quarter ended Sept. 30). Besides its overall investment, Microsoft also disclosed the toll its bankrolling of OpenAI is taking on its profits. The company said that losses from its stake in OpenAI were part of the reason it had a $683 million expense on its equity investments for the quarter. On AI, Google touted how the boom has boosted its cloud business. But even more interestingly, CEO Sundar Pichai said AI is writing over 25% of new code at the company, but engineers still review the work before using it. While the rest of the AI-related earnings statements from the companies were somewhat predictable, I would’ve loved to hear more detail about the programming by AI. Google did not respond to my questions about what this looks like in process, including what types of coding projects it’s found AI is best suited for (or not so great at) and if it’s shipped anything coded by AI yet. AI is increasingly not only the product, but also making the products too. On future earnings calls, will we hear that increased efficiency of AI coding (or layoffs of expensive engineers) are boosting profits? And with that, here’s more AI news.

Join global executives and policy leaders at the Fortune Global Forum in New York City Nov. 11-12 to discuss AI, the future of democracy, rising geopolitical tensions, and more. Request your invite here. OpenAI is working with Broadcom and TSMC to create its own AI chips. Reuters reported that OpenAI has dropped its ambitions to create its own foundries—the name for factories that produce semiconductors—due to the immense cost and time that would be required. Instead, OpenAI has been working with Broadcom to build its first AI chip focusing on inference for several months and, through Broadcom, has secured manufacturing capacity with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The AI firm plans to make its first custom-designed chip in 2026, but sources told Reuters the timeline may change. OpenAI is also tapping commercially available chips from AMD, further rounding out its plan to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. AI power and data center projects get a $50 billion boost from Wall Street. Investment giant KKR and private equity group Energy Capital Partners are working together with tech companies to accelerate their access to electricity required for AI and will make a combined $50 billion in investments over the next four years. Doug Kimmelman, founder and senior partner at Energy Capital Partners, told the Wall Street Journal that “[natural] gas is going to be at the forefront of this.” The insatiable energy demands of AI continue to be one of the largest issues with the technology. Over the last several weeks, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all announced investments in nuclear energy as they search for a more environmentally-friendly way to power their AI. AI designed to identify people who need help paying their water bill offers big discount to one of the city’s richest customers instead. The water bureau of Portland, Ore., piloted a machine learning algorithm designed to predict customers' ability to pay and then offer discounts to those who are struggling. One of the first customers the algorithm targeted, however, was Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle, who said he received notice he was being given a 40% discount even though he has no trouble paying his water bill. Boyle earned more than $1.6 million last year and holds Columbia shares worth more than $1.7 billion. “I don’t want the discount—they should give it to somebody who needs it,” Boyle told local news outlet Willamette Weekly. The Portland Water Bureau approved $350,000 for the contract for the pilot with contractor SERVUS.

The stock was up about 7% on Friday morning. Here are the results. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report: In cloud, Amazon Web Services revenue was a hair below consensus estimates, but it's growing faster than the same period last year. Sales grew 19% during the quarter compared to a year ago when sales accelerated by 12%. The company was navigating slowing growth in its cloud business last year as customers trimmed their budgets due to heightened economic concerns. AWS is still growing at a slower rate than its top challengers. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services at Microsoft came in at 33%, and Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased nearly 35%. Amazon's capital expenditures surged 81% year-over-year from $12.48 billion to $22.62 billion as it continues to invest in data centers and equipment like Nvidia GPUs to power its artificial intelligence products. Amazon has launched several AI products in its cloud and e-commerce businesses, and it's also expected to announce a new version of its Alexa voice assistant powered by generative AI. The company's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call that the majority of the company's 2024 capex spending is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company plans to spend about $75 billion on capex in 2024 and that he suspects the company will spend more in 2025. "The increase bumps here are really driven by generative AI," Jassy said during a call with analysts. "It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity," he said, noting that shareholders "will feel good about this long term, that we're aggressively pursuing it." Advertising was another bright spot in the report. Sales in the unit expanded 19% year over year to $14.3 billion during the quarter, outpacing growth in Amazon's core retail business. Amazon and Apple, which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, round out a busy week of earnings for the top tech companies. Alphabet on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results, driven by cloud growth. Microsoft issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, leading to the stock's steepest selloff in two years, while Meta beat estimates but warned of significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses next year. Among online ad companies, Amazon showed the strongest growth, although its ad business still remains a fraction the size of juggernauts Meta and Google. Meta's advertising revenue grew 18.7% year over year, while Google's advertising business increased 15% in the quarter. Snap's sales jumped 15% from a year earlier. Amazon forecast revenue in the current quarter to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, which would represent growth of 7% to 11% year over year. The midpoint of that range, $185 billion, fell short of the average analyst estimate of $186.2 billion, according to LSEG. Operating income during the third quarter grew 56% year over year to $17.4 billion, showing that Amazon's focus on efficiency and continued cost-cutting continues to lift the bottom line. Jassy has been laser-focused on trimming expenses across the company, cutting more than 27,000 jobs since the beginning of 2022. Amazon has continued to restructure its teams this year. Wall Street has applauded Jassy's campaign to rein in expenses, with Amazon shares up about 23% year to date. The Nasdaq has gained roughly 27% over the same stretch. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Peloton appoints Apple Fitness+ co-founder, now Ford executive, as its next CEO

Peloton has appointed its next CEO NEW YORK -- Peloton has appointed its next CEO. Peter Stern, co-founder of Apple Fitness+ and a current Ford executive, will soon helm of the tech-fitness company. Stern takes over as president and CEO on January 1, Peloton said Thursday. Karen Boone, one of two current interim CEOs, will continue to serve as chief executive through the end of the year, the company said. Shares for the New York company climbed more than 20% Thursday. Thursday's announcement arrives nearly six months after Barry McCarthy stepped down as Peloton’s chief executive. His departure in May came alongside larger restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the company, which included the layoffs of hundreds of employees. Sales of Peloton bikes soared during the early days of COVID-19, when many consumers turned to at-home workouts, but that all slowed as pandemic restrictions eased. As a result, the company has reported losses in more recent years. Peloton also reported Thursday that it lost $900,000 during its first quarter on revenue of $586 million. Both were better than Wall Street had expected. In efforts to turn things around, Peloton has been working on rebranding itself for some time — shifting its identity as a seller of luxury exercise bikes and equipment to health technology for all. The company recently unveiled plans to sell its deluxe stationary bike at a discount at Costco this holiday season. And back in 2022, Peloton made its exercise bikes and other gear available on Amazon in the U.S. In a statement Thursday, Stern called working for Peloton “a dream come true" — adding that he is grateful for the opportunity "to take Peloton and its Members to even greater heights.” According to the company, Stern himself has been a Peloton member since 2016. He currently serves as president of Ford Integrated Services — and previously also held leadership roles at Time Warner Cable and Apple, where he co-founded Apple Fitness+. In connection with this week's announcement, Chris Bruzzo, who has been serving as Peloton's co-interim CEO alongside Boone, will step down on Friday. But both Bruzzo and Boone will remain members of Peloton's board. Stern is also expected to get a seat on the board. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Big Tech's vanishing perks have left employees to face a stark new reality

Boo! Did I scare you? If not, maybe this will surprise you: Microsoft disclosed an equity investment in OpenAI for the first time, SEC filings show. It could hint at an evolution in their relationship, as the tech giant previously described their deal as "a long-term partnership" in filings. In today's big story, Big Tech is pulling back on the freebies for its employees. What's on deck: But first, is this free? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Use it. Don't abuse it. That's the hard lesson tech workers are learning about their jobs' free perks, Business Insider's Lara O'Reilly, Rob Price, Hugh Langley, and Sydney Bradley write. After years of upping the ante with everything from exercise classes to laundry services, tech companies are clamping down on the freebies. It's part of a broader push to cut costs across the industry. Those efforts took center stage recently when Meta fired employees for misusing Grubhub credits. Instead of buying food, people used the perk for things like laundry detergent and wine glasses. Employees everywhere have been known to bend the rules with work benefits. A Citibank employee was fired after expensing business trip meals he eventually admitted were for his partner. The difference for tech might be how widespread the perks are. Tech companies have gone out of their way to fully subsidize almost everything for their employees. It's not charity. The perks help recruit and retain talent and keep employees working at the office. (Free lunch at the office means more time spent working there.) A tech giant's pullback on one work perk is causing an uproar. Amazon's new return-to-office mandate, which requires employees in the office five days a week, continues to face pushback from its workforce. More than 500 employees signed a letter sent to Amazon Web Services' CEO Matt Garman criticizing his support of the policy, BI's Jyoti Mann and Ashley Stewart write. While speaking at an all-hands earlier this month, Garman said nine out of 10 Amazonians he spoke to were "actually quite excited about this change." Remote work made it harder to innovate and collaborate, he added. Some Amazon employees aren't buying it. In the letter to Garman, they said the lack of hard numbers backing up the decision "fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues." The true benefits and downsides of remote work are hard to nail down. Some studies have shown workers are more productive when working from home. Another conducted last year found remote work can stifle innovation. It's not all bad news for Amazon employees, though. When contacted by BI about the letter, a company spokesperson said in some cases Amazon would offer resources to employees like elder care and pet sitters. In other words, perks.

Title: Delphi Interactive’s Leadership on Challenging Gaming’s ‘Publisher Industrial Complex,’ Hiring Ex-Nordisk Games Chief Mikkel Weider (EXCLUSIVE)
URL: https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/delphi-interactive-nordisk-games-mikkel-weider-strictly-business-1236192058/

By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst It’s been a tough year for the games business, with thousands of layoffs and game cancellations roiling the industry. Is there room for a new company emerging from stealth to tackle the AAA console and PC space? The leaders of Delphi Interactive are making a big bet they can make their mark on the sector as an independent player. Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard and president Andy Kleinman joined Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast to discuss their AAA-first business model, which kicked off with IO Interactive’s upcoming “Project 007,” and revealed their hiring of former Nordisk Games CEO Mikkel Weider as Delphi’s managing partner in Europe. Related Stories VIP+ Why SAG-AFTRA Is Smart to Threaten Holiday Gaming Boycott Latin Mafia Announces First U.S. Tour (EXCLUSIVE) Weider “essentially blitz-scaled Nordisk Games from one employee to 1,300 in just a few years,” says Daugaard, describing how Weider expanded the gaming division of Denmark’s Nordisk Film by acquiring Swedish “Just Cause” developer Avalanche Studios in 2018 and “Until Dawn” studio Supermassive Games in 2022. Weider joins a team that Daugaard and Kleinman say counts seasoned talent with experience at EA, Rockstar Games and Microsoft Gaming’s roster of publishers. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: Until now, Delphi hasn’t made a peep about the company’s ambitions since “Project 007,” a James Bond origin story, was first announced in 2020. The game is being developed and published by IO Interactive, the company behind the long-running “Hitman” franchise, in association with Delphi, which is licensing the Bond intellectual property from producer Barbara Broccoli’s Danjaq holding company and MGM (Despite Amazon acquiring the latter in 2022, Amazon Games is not involved with “Project 007”). IO Interactive hasn’t revealed much about the game or its release window, but Daugaard sees “Project 007” as representative of Delphi’s mission, which includes a slate of unannounced projects. “In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard says. While IO Interactive remains the sole developer of “Hitman” and currently publishes it as an independent entity, that wasn’t always the case. The Danish studio spent more than a decade as a Square Enix subsidiary before its management buyout in 2017, a year after rebooting “Hitman” in 2016. IO Interactive then published “Hitman 2” in 2018 through Warner Bros. Games before going solo for “Hitman 3” in 2021, eventually repackaging all three games into its “World of Assassination” offering, which continues to add content and update the game for players. It’s the rare example of a predominantly single-player, AAA experience that has extended its shelf life well past its initial release window, which is typically when such games make the brunt of their sales. But as much as heralded AAA franchises like “The Last of Us,” “Uncharted” and “Fallout” have produced Hollywood hits, it’s often a different case when reversed. “Marvel’s Spider-Man” may be a PlayStation powerhouse, but 2024 has seen high-profile games like “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League” and “Star Wars Outlaws” flounder. Warner Bros. Discovery wrote down a $200 million loss for its gaming division on the “Suicide Squad“ title, bringing its “Hogwarts Legacy” victory lap to an end, while Ubisoft delayed its next “Assassin’s Creed” game in response to “Outlaws” falling short of sales expectations (Ubisoft is reportedly exploring a sale to Chinese tech giant Tencent). “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP,” says Daugaard. “They’ve also become fundamentally misaligned more and more with independent AAA developers. And that’s where Delphi saw an opportunity, a significant opportunity, to step in and offer a sort of very attractive alternative to owners of IP and to AAA developers.” Kleinman says Delphi has been “inspired a lot“ by companies like Legendary Entertainment. “Their whole thesis was that they could come in initially with financing, but their plan was to try to make these big blockbuster films outside of the legacy Hollywood studios,” he says. “Skydance came later and built a similar thesis, which has now become really big, and now they’re taking over [Paramount Global] to try to modernize it with their way of doing things. But that doesn’t exist in gaming, and especially in AAA gaming.” According to Daugaard, major publishers are “no longer ideal partners” for the biggest third-party IP, on account of what he and Kleinman believe is a prioritization of their wholly owned IP. He has a point. Leading live-service platforms have stepped in as lucrative partners to major Hollywood studios. Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games in 2024 to build IP-driven experiences on “Fortnite,“ while Universal and Warner Bros. partnered with Roblox to promote films like “Kung Fu Panda 4,” “Despicable Me 4,” “Godzilla x Kong” and “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” that hit their marks at the box office this year. Likewise, two of the Big Five movie studios — Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. — exist alongside full-fledged gaming divisions within their corporate parents. As Kleinman points out, that could become three if Skydance completes its acquisition of Paramount due to Skydance Interactive and Skydance New Media, though the latter division does have AAA Marvel and Star Wars games in the works. The significance of mobile gaming, which comprises half of the global video game market, shouldn’t be ignored either. Companies like Scopely, where Kleinman was once chief business officer, thrive on licensed IP, so much so that Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group for $4.9 billion in 2023 after the success of “Monopoly Go!” Before Scopely, Kleinman worked at mobile giant Zynga, which went to “Grand Theft Auto” parent Take-Two Interactive for $12.7 billion in 2022. Kleinman also worked at Disney Interactive some years before Disney CEO Bob Iger closed the division in 2016. Kleinman doesn’t seem fazed by the challenges involved in licensing major intellectual property. “When Disney or Warner Bros. or any of these studios are thinking about the strategy for some of the biggest IPs, it’s not just one thing that they do,” says Kleinman. “They explore different ways to attract the different types of fans [who] are engaged with that IP… Some of those fans are the audiences that are within Roblox and Fortnite and who want to have those games. They’re very engaged with those games… We think about the single-player, story-driven experience, and usually it starts with something that you know can be played in 12 to 16 hours, as opposed to 80 to 100 hours, and you feel a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you’re playing it.” As Daugaard puts it, “It’s natural that everybody wants a Fortnite. There’s an 11- or maybe even 12-figure upside to that, if you can pull that off.“ On the other hand, he adds, it’s also “a very volatile proposition with a massive downside, a massive risk.” For instance, Sony Interactive Entertainment is scaling back Playstation’s push into live services after “Concord“ was pulled from release less than two weeks after launching in August, resulting in the decision Tuesday to shutter its developer Firewalk Studios. An online game for “The Last of Us” was also cancelled last year and serious adjustments were made to “Destiny 2,” the once-thriving live service that helped make the case for Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie, in 2024. SIE cut 220 roles at Bungie and moved additional personnel to other PlayStation studios. The same day Firewalk was closed, EA announced competitive shooter “Apex Legends“ would undergo “large systematic change“ after an update missed expectations. Daugaard sees the evolution of “Hitman” as providing a reliable template for extending a gaming franchise, as opposed to creating a live service from scratch. “You have this strong core single-player experience, and then you carefully layer on live-services elements around this core, and then you expand in… these concentric circles from there and create a single-player-as-a-service that can be a very, very good business and very durable,” says Daugaard. “We think that is a more organic approach than launching a super expensive, mega live-services game and hope that people will show up.” “We are seeing a lot of great independent talent that we want to partner with, that want to partner with us some, because they’re looking for an alternative to these traditional publishers,” says Kleinman.

Title: The sales numbers for Intel’s new chips are just depressing

Time Published: 2024-10-30T22:53:17Z

Intel’s latest Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 200S processors have been off to a rocky debut, receiving middling reviews from hardware testers, including from our own testing. But according to recent sales data from Mindfactory, Germany’s leading online PC hardware retailer, not a single Core Ultra 200-series CPU has been sold so far. Meanwhile, AMD continues to dominate with 95% of Mindfactory’s CPU market share. This weak showing underscores significant challenges for Intel in a market that is traditionally open to new hardware innovations but has recently leaned heavily toward AMD’s Ryzen lineup due to competitive pricing and robust performance. 🔥 first Arrow Lake post launch sales numbersAMD share shoots up to 95% ℹ️ UnitsAMD: 730 units sold, 94.81%, ASP: 267Intel: 40, 5.19%, ASP: 388 ℹ️ RevenueAMD: 195201, 92.64%Intel: 15509, 7.36% pic.twitter.com/oaiyG8LO4L &mdash; TechEpiphany (@TechEpiphanyYT) October 29, 2024 The Arrow Lake lineup includes desktop SKUs like the Core Ultra 9 285K and Core Ultra 7 265K. Despite Intel’s latest AI and performance enhancements, these processors haven’t captured the interest of Germany’s PC enthusiasts. In fact, Mindfactory’s recent CPU sales charts reveal that Intel’s highest-ranking product, the Core i5-13400, languishes in 21st place, far behind AMD’s Ryzen chips, with sales volume primarily concentrated in AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 7 5700X3D. Intel’s processors accounted for just about 40 units sold, representing only 5% of total CPU sales — a stark contrast to AMD’s top-selling chips, which saw 190 and 80 units sold, respectively. This lackluster performance in Germany starkly contrasts Arrow Lake’s U.S. market presence where some SKUs, as per Tom’s Hardware, have sold out on platforms like Newegg and Amazon. However, the Core Ultra 200S series has not been universally well-received, with mixed reviews pointing to a regression in gaming performance compared to prior generations. In addition, Intel’s recent financial difficulties, including a reported $1.6 billion quarterly loss and layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce, may have impacted the company’s ability to aggressively push the Arrow Lake lineup in competitive markets. Another possible factor affecting Intel’s German sales could be regional discontent following the halted construction of Intel’s $30 billion chip fabrication plant in Magdeburg. Planned as part of a broader strategy to establish local manufacturing and strengthen ties with the European market, this delay — or potential abandonment — may have dampened enthusiasm for Intel’s products within Germany, further fueling AMD’s dominance. In sum, Intel faces an uphill battle to regain footing in a European market where AMD has established a significant presence, and Arrow Lake’s lackluster debut only adds to its recent setbacks. Addressing these challenges will require more than incremental hardware updates. Intel may need to rethink its strategy to convince discerning buyers that the Core Ultra series is worth the investment in a fiercely competitive landscape. Intel's upcoming Arrow Lake processors have been the topic of much speculation in the last few months, but we're finally at the finish line. Multiple sources are reporting that the release date we've been hearing about for weeks is now final, meaning that Intel's next-gen processors are now less than a month away. Here's what we know. With no Intel Innovation event this year, things have been quiet as far as Arrow Lake goes -- but the leaks never cease. The initial Arrow Lake (also known as Intel Core Ultra 200 series) release date that various tipsters spoke about was always said to be October 10, but a few weeks ago, it was revealed to be October 24. Now, with today's new information, we can say with some confidence that it appears to be the final release date. We first reported on the Intel CPU instability issue in February 2024, and since then, Intel has offered various fixes that helped, but still failed to fix the problem once and for all. Now, it finally seems like the owners of Intel's best CPUs might soon be able to rest easy. Intel has shared a new update that pinpoints the four causes of Raptor Lake problems and provides a fix. Intel's July update on the matter disclosed that the company was aware of issues within the microcode and that the problem was related to incorrect voltages. Today's update breaks this down into four operating scenarios that can cause problems. Intel now refers to these long-lasting issues as the "Vmin Shift Instability." Intel's list of best processors is about to expand with the upcoming launch of Arrow Lake-S, also referred to as Intel Core Ultra 200-series for desktops. But what comes next is less certain, and even more so now. According to a post on the Chiphell forums, Intel may have decided to cancel the Arrow Lake-S refresh (Intel Core Ultra 300-series, presumably) that was reportedly slated for sometime next year as a follow-up to this year's initial launch. On the upside, the code name for an upcoming desktop CPU generation was also leaked. The rumored Arrow Lake-S refresh was never confirmed, but there have been many whispers about it from various leakers. Much like the Raptor Lake refresh, it was never meant to be a groundbreaking update; the neural processing unit (NPU) was the main thing that was going to be updated.

Title: Dropbox lays off 20% of employees and joins Big Tech's flattening trend. Read CEO Drew Houston's memo.

Dropbox is the latest major company to slash its staff and flatten its organizational structure. In an email sent to employees on Wednesday, its CEO and cofounder, Drew Houston, announced that the cloud-storage company was laying off 528 employees — roughly 20% of its workforce. "As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I'm truly sorry to those impacted by this change," Houston wrote. These cuts come as the company undergoes what he called a "transitional period." It's focusing its efforts on its maturing file-sync-and-share business and products such as Dash, Dropbox's AI-powered work assistant. "However, navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable," Houston wrote. The Dropbox chief cited "softening demand and macro headwinds" in the company's core business. "But external factors are only part of the story," he added. "We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down." Houston said that the layoffs were targeting "over-invested or underperforming" areas. Dropbox is the latest example of a tech giant thinning out its management ranks to create a flatter organizational structure with the goal of moving faster. Amazon announced a similar move earlier this year, with CEO Andy Jassy saying he wanted senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." Mark Zuckerberg instituted manager cuts and increased the average number of direct reports for Meta managers after complaining about "managers managing managers." Dropbox's layoffs come more than a year after the company's decision to cut about 16% of its workforce, or 500 employees, in April 2023. Houston's memo to employees at the time also attributed those layoffs to headwinds and freeing up investment bandwidth for more products powered by artificial intelligence. Starting Wednesday, affected workers will be eligible for 16 weeks of pay, with an additional week of pay for each completed year of tenure, the memo said. They will also see their fourth-quarter equity vest and can access free job-placement and coaching services, it added. Affected employees can also keep their work-issued devices. Dropbox did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Jump to

The company's stock price was down slightly in after-hours trading. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Sales in the third quarter jumped 19% year over year while net income grew 35% to $15.7 billion from $11.6 billion a year earlier. That represents Meta's lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023. The company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion. Meta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses. "Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts. Zuckerberg has been pointing to the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence, which includes spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company's core online ad business in the aftermath of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update. The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy. More than one million advertisers have used Meta's generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said. Meta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion. Meta's advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter. Revenue from Meta's Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company's slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein would affect Meta's overall revenue. Meta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion. The company's Reality Labs hardware unit posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts' expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts' expectations of $310.4 million. Since 2020, Meta's Reality Labs unit has recorded an operating loss of more than $58 billion. The company's overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30. The social media company's results come a day after digital ad companies Alphabet, Reddit and Snap all reported solid quarterly earnings. Microsoft reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines. Alphabet on Tuesday said third-quarter sales from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers. Microsoft on Wednesday reported that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services. Apple and Amazon report quarterly financials on Thursday. WATCH: Meta's revenue has room to run despite all their AI spending. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: There’s No Way To Reach The Top Of Hollywood’s Corporate Ladders Because The Boomers Already There Won’t Leave

And your Boomer boss isn’t vacating that corner office anytime soon. Inside Hollywood’s Great Malaise. By Mia Galuppo Film Writer If you’re planning on attending Tom Rothman’s party in November, you’ll need a costume. Rumor has it the Sony chairman is asking invitees to the event — which is a joint birthday bash with his wife, actress Jessica Harper — to dress up as characters from movies made under his reign. Luckily, it’s a long list of wardrobe choices, stretching back a multitude of decades. You could go as Jack Dawson from 1997’s Titanic. Or Satine from 2001’s Moulin Rouge! Or Miranda Priestly from 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada. Or Rick Dalton from 2019’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Related Stories Movies How Janelle Monáe Became the Queen of Halloween Business Alex Cooper Is Blowing Up: "I'm a Motherf***er When It Comes to Business" The point here is, Rothman is turning 70 and has been in charge at Sony (and before that, Fox) for a very, very long time. As it happens, he’s not the only silver mogul in Hollywood these days. Bob Iger is 73 and has been running Disney off and on for nearly 20 years. Ari Emanuel, 63, has been running WME for nearly 30 years, since he started his agency in 1995 (after starting in the mail room at CAA, the company co-founded by then-28-year-old Michael Ovitz in 1975). Jeremy Zimmer, 66, has been running UTA for more than 30 years, since he co-founded that agency in 1991. Michael De Luca is a relative spring chicken at 59, but he’s been fronting studio slates — at New Line, MGM, Amazon and Warner Bros. — for three decades. Many of these no-longer-so-young Turks are now old enough to qualify for AARP discounts. But few of them seem in any huge rush to retire. And that’s the problem. Or at least it is for a new generation of ambitious show-business strivers under the age of 50 who find themselves unhappily stuck on the middle rungs of Hollywood’s corporate ladder. Unlike their bosses, some of whom ascended to the heights of authority in their 30s (Emanuel) and even their late 20s (De Luca), young professionals today — who are toiling in an industry plagued with title deflation and ever-diminishing paydays — see no clear path to the top. Not one that isn’t blocked by an all-powerful boomer who’s been perched in a corner office since the Bush administration. The first one. “These people have been making movies since the 1990s,” notes one 50-something former head of production. “That’s a long time to have a position of authority and to be a gatekeeper of cultural decisions.” “It’s become so fucking depressing,” agrees a veteran agent, also in his 50s. “Even 10 years ago, executives were like movie stars. They were making tons of movies and were empowered to be bold and do cool things. Now, most executives can’t even hire writers without asking their boss.” Of course, a lot of these bosses are still bosses for good reasons. Rothman, for one, can hog credit for more than 150 Oscar nominations for movies made during his long tenure at Sony. Many of these sexagenarians have built empires from the ground up, guided their companies through mergers, spinoffs and acquisitions, and have skillfully steered their workforces through an ever-revolving series of corporate overlords. They’ve not only proved they have staying power — they’ve proved there’s power in staying. Still, fair or not, there’s a mounting resentment among young (or young-er) Hollywood. Speaking (mostly off the record) with studio executives, producers, agents, assistants — dozens of entertainment industry professionals ranging from their 20s to their 60s — there’s a wide consensus that the kids aren’t alright. Many younger execs feel they’re spinning their wheels, going nowhere — and not even particularly fast — with increasing numbers abandoning Hollywood altogether and decamping for careers in other trades (like, gasp, data analytics). Obviously, there are myriad reasons for the malaise gripping the town — the lingering aftereffects of the pandemic, the industry-wide economic shrinkage, the labor unrest, the waves and waves of layoffs. But a lot of young executives also are casting weary glances at the aging eminences who’ve been occupying Hollywood’s C-suites seemingly forever. The time has come, you can all but hear them rumbling, to start handing out gold watches. *** You’re a 37-year-old mid-level studio exec. You wake up in Hollywood in the year of our Bryan Lourd, 2024. From bed, you check your email and find the latest gloomy blasts from the trades: another 15 percent staff reduction at Paramount Global, and Disney is planning about 300 more layoffs. There’s also an email from a former exec you used to do business with, and you almost scroll past it, at first not recognizing their personal Gmail. Lately, there have been a lot of emails from personal accounts as people shed their corporate addresses or, more likely, as those corporations shed them. This one is a victim from one of the layoffs that happened three or six months prior, you can’t remember which, but you are confident that the quarterly earnings report claimed profitability. They are hoping to take you out to coffee in their latest go around town to see if anywhere is hiring. You thought you had heard they went into real estate, but it must have been someone else. You’ve considered jumping careers yourself, even researched a couple of grad schools, but that was before they finally gave you the promotion they had been talking about since before the strikes. The pay bump wasn’t what you imagined, but you got equity. Or was it that they traded some of your salary for stock? It doesn’t matter, you are barely making what it takes to afford the mortgage on the $1.2 million median home price in Los Angeles County, but it convinced you to hang on for another year. Sunk cost is supposed to be a fallacy, but what do you know? You didn’t get past the home screen for that online MBA program. You are fast approaching 40, living the current reality of the Hollywood dream, and you just want to go back to bed. Of course, it was not always this way. Back in 1986, the Los Angeles Times ran a story headlined “Baby Mogul Running Fast for Fox.” It was about a 28-year-old whiz kid — maybe you’ve heard of him, Scott Rudin? — who had just taken over as president of production at 20th Century Fox, where he was overseeing releases like Penny Marshall’s Big and the Coen brothers’ Raising Arizona. The story laid out the ages of the other heads of the then-eight major Hollywood studios, including Disney’s chairman, Jeff Katzenberg, who was just 35 at the time. And that was Katzenberg’s second job as studio chief; he’d been all of 31 when he got hired to run Paramount. The median age of the presidents of production of the majors in 1986 was 35. “They were who I had in my head when I started in Hollywood,” says a current studio executive in his 50s of these former wunderkinds. “Now that I’ve got here, it’s the worst time to have this job.” Less than a decade after Rudin took over at Fox, De Luca bested him by a year, getting hired at age 27 as New Line’s president of production in 1993. De Luca didn’t have greenlight authority back then, but he had the next best thing — the ear and backing of New Line chairman Bob Shaye. “I walked into [Shaye’s office] with a 170-page epic on porn in the ’70s and a guy with a 13-inch penis,” De Luca once recalled his pitch for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights. “And he was fine with it.” Today, it’s hard to imagine any 20-something having that kind of clout in Hollywood. Or even a 30-something. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine De Luca, now co-chair and CEO of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, greenlighting a Boogie Nights-like screenplay brought to him by an underling. According to younger execs, that’s precisely what’s wrong with the industry in 2024: It’s still being run by the same people who ran it in 1994. “You look at Mike De Luca, who goes from MGM to Amazon over to Warner Bros. You look at Tom Rothman, who goes from Fox to Sony. These same people are being recycled, and because they’re being recycled, there’s less opportunity for the people under them to be given a shot,” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts (and a former THR editor). “And giving them a shot now seems high-risk.” It’s not just graying studio chiefs who are stubbornly clinging to their jobs; the layers of execs beneath them — the executive vps and those under them, and also those under them — also are sticking in jobs for longer. Who can blame them? Right now, there aren’t a whole lot of other jobs out there. Meanwhile, the cost of retirement continues to rise, especially for those accustomed to a certain Hollywood lifestyle. People are living longer; health care and home care have never been more expensive. There’s every reason to stay put, if you can. “The challenges in sustaining yourself in Hollywood have become greater,” notes a 50-something producer. “So, you hold on for dear life.” The word a lot of folks in the business banter about is “contraction.” But what comes right after is in some ways an even scarier word: “stagnation.” *** If the upshot of all this were merely the shattered career dreams of a bunch of Gen X and millennial movie executives, this story probably wouldn’t have been written. But the implications for the film business — and for the wider cinematic culture — are actually pretty profound, at least according to many of the Gen X and millennial movie executives with whom THR spoke. “It’s a massive problem that the people in power are so far away from Gen Z,” says a mid-30s producer. “They show up for movies when they have something that speaks to them, but whenever they happen upon something that appeals to Gen Z, it feels like they just stepped on a rake.” “You get to a point where you’re living in your beautiful house in the hills, you’re meeting only other wealthy people and you’re not connecting to the audience,” adds Galloway. “And the moviegoing audience is primarily young, so at a certain point you become really detached from them.” Which explains why so much of what Hollywood is producing these days feels so familiar. For instance, there are currently remakes or sequels in development for ’80s classics like An Officer and a Gentleman, Ghost and Dirty Dancing — projects that have little or no emotional resonance to anyone under 50. Obviously, remakes have long been a studio staple. But a War of the Roses redo? A new Running Man offering? It’s unclear whether these nostalgia plays will be all that appealing even to people over 50. Meanwhile, younger executives, especially from underrepresented communities, are navigating studios that are still overwhelmingly white and male, and finding it increasingly difficult to get attention for projects outside of a four-quadrant family film. “[Studios] hired all these mission-driven people of color who now can’t make their passion projects,” says one 30-something agent. “Now, everyone wants Yellowstone.” “Boomers tend to value their own opinions, and they all validate each other,” says a studio executive in their 40s. “They built these systems to just take care of each other. There is no trust with anyone other than themselves.” To be fair, it’s not just boomer bosses who are distrustful these days. There’s been a general trend toward top-down management at many of the studios and even streamers, and it has little to do with age. Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria — who is only 53 — has sat in on humble pitch meetings, something that used to be considered well below her title’s pay grade. As the industry contracts — and stagnates — it becomes more and more risk-averse, with those in charge hoarding their power rather than sharing it with fresh talent coming up through the ranks, in essence starving the next generation of the experience necessary to grow beyond their current titles. (Also, for that matter, starving the town of personality.) “The business used to be a little more batshit crazy,” notes a former production president. “Everyone used to be a lunatic. Now it feels a little more polite. A little more suit-y. Not that people are wearing suits.” Stapler-throwing aside, Hollywood’s more freewheeling ways did tend to yield extraordinary content. Film executives used to make their mark by championing idiosyncratic projects, sometimes putting their careers on the line to do so, then using that win — if there was one — to catapult themselves to their next title or another studio. That doesn’t happen so much anymore. In the age of the plug-and-play franchise, it’s become harder for executives to stand out. And even when they do, it doesn’t always guarantee a promotion. For instance, Nathan Samdahl, the production exec who brought in and oversaw the original horror film Smile, was laid off at Paramount Global in a 2022 cost-cutting effort — just before the movie went on to become one of the studio’s most profitable of the year. (Samdahl eventually found a new home at Walter Hamada’s production banner.) Stagnation, of course, isn’t just rough on those in first class; turbulence is always worse at the back of the plane. The old route to mogul used to start in the mail room — where Emanuel began his journey — but these days even landing a junior job is a lot harder than it used to be. Galloway notes that Chapman University’s career center has clocked a dip of 30 percent in entry-level gigs over the past year. Those few lucky enough to snag an assistant gig often find themselves working even longer hours than their predecessors did, assigned to multiple desks, earning somewhere between $21 to $25 an hour with lessening chances of advancement. All this career inertia isn’t just bad for Hollywood’s younger workforce. In the long run, it’s bad for the future of the business. In fact, it’s potentially deadly. It means that someday, maybe soon, there won’t be anybody left in Hollywood’s dwindling workforce who’ll have a clue about how to run a set. Or a slate. Or a studio. Says one 50-something former studio exec of the looming brain-drain crisis, “It’s an existential threat.” What’s the way forward? How do we find our way out of this stagnation quagmire? Maybe Hollywood, never one for original ideas on or off the screen, should look backward, to the earliest days of the film business. One role model for yesterday’s whiz kid turned today’s silver mogul might be David O. Selznick, who became RKO’s head of production in 1931, at age 29, went on to make Gone With the Wind, Rebecca, Spellbound, A Star Is Born and a slew of other enduring classics, then abruptly stopped making movies and functionally retired in 1948 because, as he put it, “I was tired.” He was 46.

Title: Alphabet’s stock jumps as ads, AI and cloud fuel strong revenue growth

UPDATED 20:14 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Google LLC’s parent company Alphabet Inc. trading higher in the after-hours session today following a solid earnings beat driven by strong cloud revenue growth. Alphabet’s stock was up more than 5% in extended trading, adding to a slight gain made during the regular trading session. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.12 per share on revenue of $88.27 billion, up 15% from a year ago. The results were better than expected. Wall Street had been anticipating earnings of just $1.85 per share on lower sales of $86.3 billion. Alphabet’s all-important Google Cloud unit delivered revenue of $11.35 billion, representing growth of 35% on the $8.41 billion in sales it reported one year earlier. The company said this growth was primarily driven by rapid update of its artificial intelligence services, which includes subscriptions to enterprise customers. On a conference call with analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai (pictured) insisted that Google Cloud’s “full stack” of AI products and services is already up and running at scale, used by billions of people worldwide and “creating a virtuous cycle.” With today’s report, Alphabet becomes the first of several “megacap” technology companies to report its latest earnings results, with Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. set to report Wednesday, and Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. to follow on Thursday. The company reported that its net income rose to $26.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $19.7 billion in the same period one year earlier. Google Search delivered $49.4 billion in sales during the quarter, up 12.3% from a year earlier, and it remains the biggest single contributor in terms of revenue growth, said Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi. She told investors that the company is planning to use AI to streamline workflows, manage its headcount and its physical footprint going forward, as it looks to build on its earlier cost-cutting efforts, which included thousands of layoffs last year and several hundred more earlier this year. “I plan to build on these efforts but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities,” Ashkenazi, who joined Alphabet in June after spending 23 years at the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly Co. Alphabet’s advertising business also grew well in the quarter, with revenue of $65.85 billion, up from $59.65 billion in the year-ago quarter, though it grew at a slower pace on a sequential basis. Within that segment, YouTube’s advertising revenue came to $8.92 billion, just ahead of the analyst’s target of $8.89 billion, with more rapid growth than in the previous quarter. That growth was encouraging as the Google-owned company has faced strong pressure from other advertising competitors such as Amazon, Netflix Inc. and TikTok’s parent company Bytedance Ltd. Alphabet Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said one reason for the growth is that AI is helping to improve YouTube recommendations. It has been using the Gemini large language model family to help recommend “more relevant, fresher and personalized content” to viewers, he insisted. Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said Alphabet’s results can be taken as a bellwether of what’s to come from the other big tech stocks set to report earnings later this week, as he’s expecting a “very strong season” thanks to a “surprisingly resilient economy and growingly supportive monetary outlook.” The analyst believes this is reflected in both Alphabet’s cloud and advertising businesses. “While some of these numbers certainly come from the positive seasonality, particularly with the U.S. election driving increasing interest in YouTube and search, the stock has been fairly underpriced amid a market that can’t seem to get enough tailwinds,” Monteiro said. Another encouraging sign was the performance of Google Workspace, which is Alphabet’s productivity tool suite. Ashkenazi said it also showed “strong growth,” as did Google Cloud Platform, which is the company’s data management and AI development suite, with revenue growing faster than that of the overall cloud unit. The Other Bets division, which includes Alphabet’s life sciences business Verily and the self-driving car division Waymo, delivered sales of $388 million during the quarter, up from $297 million in the same period one year ago. Waymo last week closed on a bumper $5.6 billion funding round, and aims to expand its nascent robotaxi service beyond Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, where it currently operates. Pichai also talked up Google Lens, an image recognition product that uses smartphone cameras to conduct visual searches. According to Pichai, usage of the service has grown to more than 20 billion visual searches per month, making it one of the company’s fastest-growing products. He said it’s most often used by people out shopping, to find more information about the products they’re looking at. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors have lots to be happy about, with Google Cloud showing strong growth thanks to its AI offerings. He said he’s optimistic about the company’s future AI growth too, thanks to its ongoing efforts to provide the best infrastructure for AI models. “Google has just announced the sixth generation of its TPU architecture, which leads the market in terms of performance,” Mueller said. “It has a three-to-four year lead over its rivals in putting custom algorithms on custom silicon, and that is illustrated by its fast-growing Google Cloud revenue. That’s why it’s no surprise to see Google is drinking its own champagne, using AI to try and increase the operational efficiency of its business.” During the quarter, Alphabet’s executive team saw quite a shakeup. Along with Ashkenazi’s arrival, the company also replaced its longtime Search and Ads boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, who previously headed up the team leading the development of Google Assistant. In addition, Alphabet revealed that the team responsible for the Google Gemini app is joining Google DeepMind, where it will report to Demis Hassabis. Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, hailed Alphabet’s strong beat across the board. “It reported stronger-than-expected revenue in all categories, including search, YouTube ads and Google Cloud, leading to 15%+ revenue growth,” he said. In light of the results, Wlodarczak said Pivotal is raising its expectations for Alphabet in the fourth quarter and beyond, reiterating its “buy” rating on the stock, which still has “substantial upside from current levels.” THANK YOU Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays Gemini in Android Studio rolls out more AI-powered development features AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Google brings grounding with search to Gemini in AI Studio and API AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 1 HOUR AGO Phish ’n’ Ships: Human Security warns of fake shops exploiting payment platforms and SEO SECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 5 HOURS AGO Sluggish chip sales curtail Samsung's profits, worrying investors INFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 16 HOURS AGO Meta's stock heads south on slow user growth and ongoing infrastructure investments APPS - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 17 HOURS AGO Microsoft's AI bet pays off as Azure revenue grows, but stock falls on infrastructure supplier delays CLOUD - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 18 HOURS AGO
