Title: A software engineer's success often depends on their relationship with their manager, says ex-Amazon technical director

A large part of an engineer's success is often tied to how they navigate their relationship with their manager, a former Amazon engineering director, Dave Anderson, said. "I would actually say, as a manager, even, like 50% of that performance, frequently, is your relationship with your manager and your team. How will you fit in with the team, with your peers, with your manager?" he said on a recent episode of "The Pragmatic Engineer," a podcast. Underestimating your supervisor's influence can be particularly dangerous at a company like Amazon, he added. As can be the case at other companies, a manager's decisions can shape the future of their direct report, from determining how much they're compensated to how far up the career ladder they climb. The influence a manager can have over an engineer's trajectory isn't something to shrug off, Anderson said. "I think the mistake that people will sometimes make is like, 'My manager doesn't influence my job that much because I can work independently,' or, you know, 'I don't need to figure this out with my manager because I can, you know, work with my peers, or I have this great engineer on my team I can work with,'" Anderson said. But if your manager doesn't like you, he added, you're "never ever" going to be able to snag a promotion. It's also important to remember that managers are often asked to point out a number of team members "who are not doing great," Anderson said. If you are, when compared with other members of your team, the "least effective," he added, you could be on the chopping block. "If you look around the room and you're thinking, 'Yep, I'm the worst one here' — that's not a great situation to ever be in. It's just never safe," Anderson said. "And at Amazon, it's definitely not safe. Some other companies where they just might do layoffs once every four years, you might be safe for quite a while. But Amazon has this sort of regular cycle." In response to a request for comment from Business Insider, Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said Anderson's experiences were his alone. "These claims reflect the opinion of one individual who worked at Amazon years ago. They're not based in fact, and aren't indicative of what it was like to work here then or what it's like today," Callahan said. "We're proud to be one of the most sought-after employers in the world and to have ranked in the top three in LinkedIn's Top Companies for eight years running." Anderson said that if an engineer's relationship with their manager isn't good, there can be an escape hatch of sorts: moving teams before being managed out. "So many times I've had someone who was either doing amazing on one team, they moved to the next team, and they're, like, actually not doing well at all, or someone who was not doing well escapes to another team before they get fired — and they do well," he said. If you start to hear rumblings from further up the chain of command, Anderson thinks it could be in your best interest to make a change, and swiftly. "This is, like, my sneaky recommendation for anyone is like — if you start to hear performance feedback whatsoever from your management chain, if you have any opportunity at all, get off your team fast as possible," he said. In a follow-up email, Anderson told BI that in a "great number of situations," he'd seen success prove itself to be at least partially dependent on team fit. "I've seen poor performers turn into great performers, and great performers turn into poor performers — and the only factor was them switching teams," he said. "In particular, switching teams to a place where they didn't know their manager. I don't think people fundamentally changed — so the only reasonable conclusion is that team fit (in particular, their relationship with their manager) is the deciding factor." Anderson doesn't suggest disavowing any negative feedback you receive and bailing out into a different section of the company on a whim. It depends, he said, on the relationship you've formed with your supervisor and whether you have faith in their advice. "Now, if you trust your manager, they might be actually just giving you honest feedback, which you'd like to be able to receive," he said. "But for the most part, if you've been working for someone for three years and suddenly they start giving you performance feedback, that's a really bad sign." Anderson added: "If you run for the hills fast enough, it's possible you'll get away before they flag you in the system as non-transferable." Jump to

Title: L.A. Mayor Karen Bass Cuts 400 Police Department Jobs in 'State of the City'

Full Content:
LOS ANGELES, California — Mayor Karen Bass tried to strike an upbeat tone as she delivered the bad news Monday in her “State of the City” speech, cutting 400 civilian jobs in the L.A. Police Department next year. The Los Angeles Times reported: Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a proposed budget on Monday that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting more than 2,700 city positions — about 1,650 of them through layoffs. … The $14 billion spending plan, which covers the 2025-26 fiscal year, would provide funding for scores of new hires at the fire department, three months after the Palisades fire destroyed thousands of homes and killed 12 people. … At the Los Angeles Police Department, more than 400 workers would be targeted for layoffs, all of them civilians, according to figures prepared by city budget officials. The number of police officers would continue on its gradual downward trajectory, with new hires failing to keep pace with attrition. Bass also claimed that the process of recovery and building after the Palisades Fire was the fastest in the history of the state: Today, in reporting on the State of our City, I report to Los Angeles that the recovery in the Palisades is on track to be the fastest in California history. We’re not just moving fast to move fast. We know that the faster we can rebuild, the faster we can heal. We still have a long way to go, and for those who have lost a home, each and every day is a day too long. We want to be fast, we want to be safe and we want to be resilient. We have issued permits to rebuild twice as fast as after the Camp and Woolsey fires, we restored water nearly a year and a half faster than after the Camp Fire, and we restored power in just two months. Los Angeles, I assure you, rebuilding is underway. Many residents, frustrated by delays in debris removal, building permits, and insurance company payouts, would disagree. Bass said the city would start using AI technology to speed up the process of approving building permits, and called on the City Council “to pass an ordinance to waive all plan check and permit fees so that Angelenos can get home.” However, skeptical residents are running out of time. And many refuse to forget that she was out of the country when the fires broke out in January, breaking a campaign promise to refuse international travel. Joel B.

Title: What’s the current news with all of the magnificent seven stocks
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/04/21/whats-the-current-news-with-all-of-the-magnificent-seven-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:15:31Z

Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

A survey reveals 81 percent of U.S. workers fear unemployment in 2025, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" than in 2024, as layoffs rise and economic instability grows. The survey reveals that employees are having a pessimistic labor market outlook, with 76 percent predicting increased layoffs, 92 percent preparing for a recession, 63 percent expecting more business closures and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout due to workload and job insecurity. With "The Great Stay" trend, employees hesitate to switch jobs due to uncertainty â only four percent feel completely secure, while 61 percent plan to upskill to stay competitive. There are also several key burnout drivers, including job insecurity (43 percent), increased workloads (29 percent) and poor work-life balance (23 percent). Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability.

Analysts attribute worker anxiety to unpredictable layoffs, economic shifts and eroded trust in once-stable institutions, calling it a rational response to systemic instability. A new survey has revealed that theÂ vast majority of U.S. workers are deeply concerned about losing their jobs in 2025, as layoffs continue to rise and economic instability looms. According to a report by My Perfect Resume,Â titled "The Great Stay: 2025 State of the Labor Market," 81 percent of workers fear job loss this year, with 20 percent feeling "much more worried" about unemployment than they did in 2024. The survey, conducted among 1,115 employees on December 2024, reveals staggering levels of anxiety, with 76 percent of respondents predicting an increase in layoffs this year, 92 percent preparing for a possible recession, 63 percent believing more business will shut down in 2025 compared to 2024 and 52 percent anticipating worsening burnout rates due to increased workloads and job insecurity. (Related: Layoff saga continues as 12 more companies announce mass employment terminations.) In line with this, the new trend of the "Great Stay" has emerged â a reluctance among employees to leave their current positions amid economic uncertainty. For instance, only four percent of workers reported feeling completely secure in their jobs, while 20 percent are "much more worried" about job loss than in 2024. Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

Additionally, 61 percent of the respondents plan to upskill this year to remain competitive, while 31 percent are considering it. Moreover, the survey reveals that economic instability is fueling workplace stress, with 43 percent of respondents citing job insecurity as the top driver of burnout. Other contributing factors include increased workloads (29 percent), lack of work-life balance (23 percent) and poor management or workplace culture (three percent). Experts: Employees are not overreacting Experts who commented on the results claimed that employees are not overreacting; they're simply responding to an unpredictable job market that offers little reassurance. CEO Patrice Williams Lindo of Career Nomad stated that layoffs have been occurring "in an unpredictably regular fashion since the start of the year," leaving employees feeling uneasy. "The economy feels unpredictable. Tariffs are shifting. The news cycle is nonstop. Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on? It's a logical emotional response. We're hardwired to spot patterns and protect ourselves from risk."

Workers are tired of being caught off guard and the anxiety is palpable," Lindo said. "It's not just fear of job loss â it's fear of being forgotten, left behind or forced to start over without a safety-net income, financial security or health insurance, just to name a few. Even high performers are staying put in jobs they've outgrown, not because they want to, but because it feels safer than stepping into the unknown right now." Meanwhile, Adriana L. Cowdin, an entrepreneur and executive coach at Be Bold Executive Coaching, said the current turbulence does not compare to past crises but has still created a "uniquely destabilizing" atmosphere. Institutions once considered stable, including government jobs, are now signaling that "nothing is guaranteed." "I've seen how political and economic shifts shape job security perceptions â whether it was the dot-com crash in 2000, the ripple effects of 9/11, the 2008 financial collapse or the COVID disruptions," she said. "When that sense of predictability vanishes, people naturally start to wonder: If I can't count on the market, the government or long-tenured companies to stay steady, what can I count on?

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. No matter how you start your early morning routines, if you want to be productive and successful, ... More career experts say you should include these five things. A recent TikTok video by @ashtonhallofficial went viral amassing a staggering 109.2 million views. The video showed the creator’s time-stamped morning routine, starting as early as three a.m. The video gained traction as viewers wonder how realistic the routine is for success. After seeing the video, career experts at resume.io decided to offer tips on how five must-haves in your morning routine guarantee career success and boost productivity throughout your workday. On some days, given the daily obstacles many of us face in our jobs, it can feel more productive to hit the alarm, roll over and go back to sleep--especially with threats of inflation, AI competition and massive layoffs. But then reality hits, reminding you that you have to future-proof your job so you don’t end up another statistic. But have you ever been curious about how the rich and famous, with less to lose, start their early mornings? The career experts at resume.io compiled the morning routines of successful CEO billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook to show they start their morning routines for continued successful workdays. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and worth $202 billion, awakens around 6:30 a.m., according to resume.io and enjoys a screen-free start to his workday. The career experts describe his mornings as slow with family breakfasts and journaling before bracing the workday. They conclude that Bezos’ slow and balanced morning routine proves that productivity doesn’t always require rushing. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is worth $188.1 billion. Career experts tell us that he starts his day at eight a.m., checking numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp. “Zuckerberg is known for his minimalistic morning routine, including wearing the same style of outfit daily to avoid decision fatigue,” they note. “This habit is also synonymous with other successful people like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama.” Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, worth $2.4 billion, is one of the earliest risers in the business world, according to the career experts. He starts his day between 3:45 a.m. “This may be what inspired TikTok creator @ashtonhallofficial to do the same,” the experts speculate. “Cook uses the early hours to get ahead on emails and current affairs. He also often completes a workout before 6 a.m. Cook credits his structured early starts with helping him stay focused throughout the workday.” You may have already realized that the difference in you and the billionaires is that they have the freedom of going to bed and getting up when they choose. Many of us in the workforce don’t have the luxury of when to hit the hay or awaken in the morning. But research informs us that routines and rituals help with self-regulation and job stress, contributing to productivity and career success. So, it’s important to consider a structured morning to get your workday off on the right foot. Amanda Augustine, career expert for resume.io, explains that you don’t need to wake up at 3 a.m. to be successful. She advises that the key to having a productive morning depends on three factors: consistency, balance and starting the day off on your own terms. Here are Augustine’s habits that can be integrated into a morning routine that guarantees career success. 1. Aim to wake up at a consistent time. “Try waking up around the same time each day to help regulate your body’s natural rhythm,” Augustine suggests. “Over time, your body will learn when it’s time to be alert, helping you avoid grogginess and feel more energized in the morning.” 2. Limit phone use for the first 30-60 minutes. “Resist the urge to jump into emails or scroll through social media—even if it’s what some famous CEOs swear by,” she advises. “Giving yourself some screen-free time in the morning can lower stress levels and help you start your day calmly and with intention, rather than reacting to the noise around you.” 3. Soak in some natural light. Augustine recommends exposing yourself to natural light within the first hour of waking up. “Whether it’s stepping outside or opening the blinds, this simple habit helps reset your internal clock, lifts your mood and supports better sleep at night.” 4. Move your body. “Incorporating movement into your morning—whether it’s stretching, walking or a quick workout—can get your blood flowing, improve your focus, and boost your mood for the rest of the day,” she points out. 5. Set your intentions for the day. “Take a few minutes each morning to jot down your top one-to-three priorities for the day.” According to Augustine, this helps bring clarity to your morning and ensures you’re starting with purpose instead of just jumping into the next thing. "Remember, the key is to build a morning routine that suits your lifestyle. This will make it easier to maintain and more effective in setting you up for long-term success,” she concludes. These five must-haves in your morning routine corroborate studies that show morning contemplation broadens your perspective and reverses negative thoughts such as self-doubt and uncertainty about the future. Whatever you plant in your mind in the early morning will continue to live and breathe within as you face the challenges in the workdays ahead.
