Title: Laptop Class on Notice

Amazon was busy this week, sending out pink slips. When it’s all said and done, this massive round of layoffs could hit up to 30,000 employees. This amounts to about 10 percent of the entire corporate workforce. The reduction in force (RIF) is expected to spread across several departments, including Human Resources, Cloud Computing (AWS), and Advertising. Moreover, this is Amazon’s largest RIF since 2022, which eliminated around 27,000 jobs. The massive layoffs have several aims. First, to address the remaining excess of the pandemic hiring spree, when online shopping boomed and Amazon doubled its warehouse network. Second, CEO Andy Jassy says he wants to use Artificial Intelligence to “do more with less.” In other words, these layoffs aren’t merely a reaction to typical economic headwinds – things like high prices or a slower market. Rather, they’re part of a structural shift for big corporations and will have permanent consequences for business, labor, and the economy. For example, massive layoffs like this at a company as enormous as Amazon are a signal that big businesses are tightening their belts. They’re looking for ways to cut expenses without hurting growth. At the same time, as tens of thousands of corporate jobs disappear, consumers will be compelled to reduce their spending. Amazon still has a market capitalization of over $2.3 trillion. These layoffs show that even the mega companies are working to conserve cash and increase efficiency by cutting jobs and replacing workers with AI. Specifically, the current strategy is to achieve growth without hiring. Amazon is not alone in this “do more with less” strategy. In fact, RTX Corporation, an aerospace and defense company, recently noted that its sales rose without adding employees. Goldman Sachs recently sent a memo to staff stating they would “constrain head count growth” to get more efficient with AI. Even Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, plans to keep its head count flat for the next three years while growing sales. Same story with UPS. The package delivery company announced this week it’s slashing a massive 48,000 jobs – 34,000 from operations and 14,000 from management – in a major effort to cut costs. This huge workforce reduction, which helped UPS beat Q3 profit expectations, is part of a plan to save $3.5 billion in 2025. A big driver for the layoffs is a massive push towards automation and AI to make operations more efficient and less labor dependent. Here’s UPS Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes on the features and benefits of AI and automation: “You need less variable capacity, fewer leased aircraft, fewer rented vehicles, fewer seasonal workers. That allows you to run a much more efficient network.” JPMorgan Chase’s CFO Jeremy Barnum recently told investors that the bank now has a “very strong bias against having the reflective response” to hire more people. The first thought is no longer ‘hire,’ but ‘automate.’ Earlier in October, white-collar workers from Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips, or learned that they would come soon. The latest wave of generative AI is proving it can efficiently handle tasks in coding, marketing, customer support, and more. Thus, companies are using AI to staff fewer jobs. While AI is augmenting some roles, its primary corporate function right now is a swift reduction in payroll… One of the key takeaways from Amazon’s layoffs is that the increased use of AI is not just for assisting, but for replacing. The layoffs are a direct result of Amazon’s massive investment in AI, which is now explicitly framed as a job eliminator. In this regard, Amazon CEO Jassy already told employees that the increased use of generative AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” in the next few years, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime technological change.” Jassy is putting his money where his mouth is. For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, with most of that dedicated to AI and cloud-computing investments. Yesterday (October 30), following market close, Amazon released its third quarter 2025 earnings results. Of note, AWS segment sales increased 20 percent year-over-year to $33 billion. Amazon has also been automating its warehouses using Blue Jay, an impressive system of robotic arms combined with AI systems, which will significantly reduce the need for warehouse laborers. Per the announcement from Amazon: “Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball—only here, the “balls” are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed. It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.” Blue Jay also doesn’t call in sick, take lunch breaks and vacation days, or require the company to contribute to an employee 401(k) match. This is but one example of the endless types of automated, worker replacement, AI applications that are being rolled out. Blue collar and white-collar workers alike should be worried. AI is coming for their jobs. But what choice do companies have. Now that the AI cat is out of the bag, its implementation and use are required to compete. Amazon’s value is now fundamentally tied to its AI aptitude. After reporting slower cloud growth than competitors earlier this year, its shares fell 7 percent. But this proved to just be a slight setback. As part of yesterday’s Q3 report, Amazon “added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months – more than any other cloud provider.” This sent the after-hours share price skyrocketing by over 13 percent the last we saw. Simply put, AI has moved from a shiny new tool to a serious factor when executives are making headcount decisions. The future is looking lean, and it’s being powered by algorithms! Amazon CEO Jassy’s aggressive push into generative AI means a slimmer corporate workforce is on the horizon. This is an all-encompassing push to replace human tasks with tools like AI agents built on services such as Amazon Bedrock. The impact is already being felt across Amazon’s white-collar departments. In Tech and AWS, the goal is to massively speed up development. AI is being deployed to write code, summarize information, and tackle research. The Bedrock platform itself allows developers to create powerful AI agents that execute complex workflows, essentially automating traditional software roles. In the process, white-collar jobs are eliminated. Human Resources – everyone’s least favorite department – is also a prime target. Layoffs have already hit the department as Amazon seeks to automate administrative work. Generative AI is now handling automated resume screening and shortlisting. AI-powered assistants are taking over common employee queries and training support, cutting the need for human administrators. AI is also taking over Advertising and Content creation. It can instantly write new marketing copy, draft social media posts, and create realistic images for campaigns. This transition proves that AI is rapidly automating the “laptop class” jobs that were once considered safe. When the industrial revolution took root, workers moved from the farm to the factory. When factory jobs were offshored over the last 40 years, the next generation of workers moved to the office. Now, with the burgeoning AI revolution taking over both factory and office jobs, where will these workers go? Is there room for them all on the government dole? Can AI somehow turn unemployment into funemployment? Certainly, as AI automates routine work, it will also create an entirely new set of jobs. Prompt Engineers, for instance, are needed to effectively communicate with AI. There’s also the need for AI Trainers to perfect the models. Perhaps a whole suite of new jobs will soon appear to fulfill the promise of AI. Yet for workers who received pink slips this week, those jobs better come soon.

Title: Anxious about AI job cuts? How white-collar workers can protect themselves - starting now

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. What's been a hard 12 months for professionals just got tougher. Fears over the increased use of AI to complete white-collar roles have been compounded by news of layoffs. If you're a mid-level professional, it's tough not to feel anxious about the future of work. In a memo to staff last week, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said her company's decision to cut 14,000 corporate roles was aimed at "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources." Also: AI struggles to cite results properly. Can Perplexity and Getty's new partnership fix that? The news from Amazon is the latest in a series of layoffs by big businesses. Experts believe one significant factor affecting the fast-changing job market is AI. Earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could be responsible for eliminating half of all entry-level white-collar jobs -- while spiking unemployment to 10-20% -- in the next one to five years. However, while AI is fundamentally altering the nature of white-collar work, professionals can take steps now to reduce their anxiety and prepare for the future. First, said Bev White, executive chair at technology and talent solutions provider Nash Squared, professionals must be honest. Examine your role and make a genuine assessment of how at risk it is from AI, now or in the future. "Think about what transferable skills you have, the core human skills that machines can't replace, and where they can be applied," she told ZDNET, suggesting professionals should research the market, network with contacts, and look for opportunities. "Work hard on how you present yourself and communicate your core strengths, to make yourself highly visible both within your own organization and to others." Also: A minority of businesses have won big with AI. What are they doing right? That approach resonates with James Carney, associate professor at the London Interdisciplinary School, who told ZDNET that we're entering an era where neither technical training nor AI competency will guarantee employability. "Instead, the differentiator will be how well people can use AI thoughtfully and how they apply their own judgment, creativity, and ethics alongside the technology," he said. Education will be a crucial component for professionals who want to future-proof their skills. To that end, Bola Rotibi, chief of enterprise research at CCS Insight, told ZDNET that professionals should retrain, reskill, and rescope their roles. "Think of AI like online banking when it arrived -- you learned the basics because it became the default," she said. "Do the same here by getting comfortable with writing clear prompts, checking outputs, and documenting what you did. That's the new baseline." Also: 4 ways to turn AI into your business advantage Rotibi also encouraged professionals to learn about data ground rules, such as where models fail, and guardrails, including the General Data Protection Regulation, audit trails, and sector policies. Finally, Rotibi suggested a principle for the digital age is that AI training should be a right, not a perk. If employers want to achieve generative AI assistant-level productivity, they should invest in access, time, and clear guardrails. "Workers should feel entitled to ask for and expect accredited courses, safe sandboxes, and clear policies, backed by government and education providers," she said. Amazon's job cuts could be indicative of several larger trends that professionals should be aware of. Rotibi said the cuts represent a shift in the work that the company considers important. AI is speeding things up, so Amazon wants fewer people coordinating and more people building technology, which explains why some office roles are affected. AI is both the tool that reduces some jobs and the magnet that pulls money and new roles into chips, power, and platforms. Also: Adobe might've just solved one of generative AI's biggest legal risks She also stressed that Amazon's cuts are part of a broader IT industry trend, with companies such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Salesforce reshaping teams, trimming middle layers, and redirecting spend toward AI platforms and data centers. Other professionals outside IT are also subject to cuts. In its analysis of Amazon's job cuts, "The Wall Street Journal" pointed to UPS reporting last week that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. "White-collar work is being reshaped, not erased," Rotibi noted. "The center of gravity is shifting from coordination to designing, integrating, and governing automated systems with fewer hand-offs and more ownership of outcomes." For professionals who will be anxious about these workplace changes, it's important to recognize that AI isn't the only explanation for the reshaping of white-collar work As Karim Morgan Nehdi, CEO at consulting and training specialist Herrmann International, suggested to ZDNET, the IT layoffs should be seen in the context of broader macroeconomic challenges. "They're about AI arriving at exactly the wrong economic moment," he said, with some of the challenges including over-hiring during the pandemic, weakening economies and tariffs, and continued geopolitical instability. "Companies facing higher costs and investor pressure needed a compelling efficiency narrative, and AI handed them one on a silver platter." However, and most crucially for professional staff, Nehdi also recognized that these layoffs feel different -- and that divergence, whatever the explanation, is due to the potential longer-term impact of AI on professionals. Research by Herrmann, in collaboration with MyPerfectResume, compared ChatGPT's cognitive profile with that of 2.5 million professionals across 800 jobs. The analysis found that ChatGPT's thinking style closely aligned with professions that rely on decision-making under pressure. Also: Is AI making it harder for new college grads to get hired in tech? Professions most cognitively similar to ChatGPT include colonels, cardiologists, and -- crucially for many readers of this article -- IT managers, with each profession sharing an alignment of over 93% with the AI's analytical thinking profile. "Our research shows that AI's cognitive overlap is highest with work we once thought was safe from automation: analytical, structured tasks that have defined many white-collar roles," he said. The conclusion, added Nehdi, is simple: "The 'safe' white-collar jobs just became a lot less safe." For anxious IT professionals concerned about the ongoing influence of AI, that warning sounds a bit like a death knell for white-collar work. However, various experts told ZDNET that it's important to put fears over AI-enabled job losses into context. Also: No ROI in AI yet? Try these six proven tactics for creating real business value First, said Nehdi, emerging technology has uneven superpowers. While AI can write code effectively, it struggles with interpersonal and visionary tasks, such as empathy, creative improvisation, and reading the room, which are capabilities that define human advantage. He said those flaws are good news for white-collar workers: "This means there's no clean 'AI replaces X profession' story. It's messier and more interesting than that. Second, and adding further complexity to the trend alluded to above, Richard Corbridge, CIO at property specialist Segro, told ZDNET that, while the march toward AI offering efficiency in some roles is valid, the pathway toward how this impact will play out is unclear. And while the recent job cuts will raise anxieties among white-collar workers, Corbridge said AI could have a positive impact on workplace roles in the longer term, as younger professionals adapt and adopt the capabilities that will define future success. Also: Are you part of 'the great stay'? Here's what experts say is behind this latest job trend For professionals, therefore, the key is to embrace change. As Nash Squared's White concluded, there is no doubt that AI will impact some white-collar jobs, but that doesn't mean there is nothing you can do about it. "Be a pathfinder, not a victim," she said. "It is on all of us to keep ourselves relevant and current. It's something I always advocate for. Set aside time to invest in yourself. Your future self will thank you for it."

Title: Why are U.S. layoffs rising even as corporate profits surge?

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 6, 2025 / 8:13 AM EST / CBS News As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year — the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy. The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a "jobless boom." Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs. "This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook," Zhao told CBS News. "It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well." At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted. "You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine — profits are doing great," he said. "We've never seen anything like that." For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as "no hire, no fire," meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers. The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP. By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring. "Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. "While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP." The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available. Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said. "You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too," he said. "So that creates a very odd equilibrium." Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies. Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword. "These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up — it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs," he noted. But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said. "People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'" he said. "I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'." Edited by Alain Sherter © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Don't miss out on our latest stories. Add PCMag as a preferred source on Google. How many jobs are being lost to AI? A new bipartisan bill would require US companies to report AI-related job losses to the federal government to track the technology’s impact on employment. On Wednesday, Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced the AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act, which "will finally give us a clear picture of AI’s impact on the workforce—what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging," Sen. Warner said in a statement. "Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind." Although researchers have already floated estimates about jobs lost to AI adoption, the senators say it's vital to start tracking the issue with concrete data. The bill proposes requiring both public and private companies in the US, as well as government agencies, to report AI-related job losses on a quarterly basis to the Department of Labor. This would cover jobs lost to automation and the use of artificial intelligence to replace human labor. Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Companies and agencies would also have to report any human hiring or human job training that was tied to the incorporation of AI. The Department of Labor would then use the data to publish a report each quarter “analyzing the net impact,” which would be available online through the department’s website. Axios reports the bill demonstrates that both political parties are concerned about AI taking jobs away from Americans, noting that Hawley and Warner were alarmed after the CEO of Anthropic warned that AI "could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs." "The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around,” Sen. Hawley says. For now, the US government remains shut down over a funding dispute in Congress. Amazon recently cut 14,000 jobs, which could rise to 30,000 next year. CEO Andy Jassy said the move was due to a culture shift, not AI. However, Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote in a memo to employees. Last month, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division after spending millions to poach people from rivals.

IBM is set to cut thousands of jobs in November and December as part of a workforce rebalancing strategy aimed at repositioning the company in the era of AI. The cuts come just months after the company claimed it is “focused on American jobs” with plans to invest in manufacturing. The Wall Street Journal reports that IBM has announced that it will lay off a small percentage of its global workforce before the end of the year. The tech giant, which employed around 270,000 people worldwide at the end of 2024, did not provide an exact figure for the number of employees affected by the cuts. Even a one percent reduction in staff would impact almost 3,000 white-collar professionals. An IBM spokesman stated, “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need. We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” IBM joins a growing list of companies, including Amazon, UPS, and Target, that have recently announced significant layoffs. These cuts are largely driven by a shift in corporate strategy towards embracing AI tools and emphasizing efficiency among employees. As AI continues to advance, many companies are investing heavily in building out the necessary infrastructure, such as data centers, to support these technologies. The layoffs at IBM come at a time when the company is striving to establish itself as a leader in the development of quantum computing. In competition with tech giants like Google and Microsoft, as well as numerous startups, IBM is working on larger clusters of quantum chips that it believes will enable large-scale computing within the next five years. Breitbart News previously reported that IBM claimed to be “focused on American jobs and manufacturing” when it announced a $150 billion investment over the next five years: IBM revealed in a Monday press release that it “plans to invest $150 billion in America over the next five years to fuel the economy and to accelerate its role as the global leader in computing.” “This includes an investment of more than $30 billion in research and development to advance and continue IBM’s American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers,” the company said. IBM CEO and Chairman Arvind Krishna added, “Technology doesn’t just build the future — it defines it.” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently shared that the company has already used AI agents to replace the work of several hundred human resources employees. This move has allowed the company to redirect resources towards hiring more programmers and salespeople, highlighting the potential of AI to streamline certain business processes and enable strategic workforce allocation.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Layoffs are sweeping the corporate world as companies restructure around AI and automation. From Amazon to Target, major employers are slashing thousands of jobs as they race to restructure around automation and efficiency. On Tuesday, IBM became the latest company to announce it would cut thousands of workers by the end of the year as it shifts focus to high-growth software and AI areas. And for Gen Z the news might hit especially hard. Just last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna had positioned himself as a rare optimist amid widespread job cuts, pledging that his company would increase hiring among recent college graduates. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that.” Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but maintained that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” An IBM spokesperson told Fortune that the latest round of layoffs would impact a “low single-digit percentage” of the company’s global workforce. And, when combined with new hiring, it would leave the company’s U.S. headcount roughly flat. IBM did not specify how many workers would be affected or which departments would be hit. The company employed about 270,000 people at the end of 2024, meaning even a 1% cut in the workforce could affect some 2,700 workers. “IBM’s workforce strategy is driven by having the right people with the right skills to do the work our clients need,” the spokesperson added. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly.” Although it’s unclear which teams—or generations—will feel the blunt effects of the cuts, entry-level roles have borne some of the biggest impact from AI so far. Researchers at Harvard University found that junior employment has declined sharply at firms adopting AI. For professionals—whether they’re trying to break into the job market or rebound from a layoff—finding a job can feel like an uphill battle. After all, job postings have been on a gradual decline since their peak in March 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Krishna’s advice? Focus on developing the right skills for the AI age. “Skills of people are really important,” he told CNN. “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.” Hiring experts echo that view, saying that firms across industries are looking for candidates with AI experience—especially those familiar with the tools already in use internally. “Companies would rather hire a candidate who has hands-on experience with a particular tool they are implementing if they have the ability and interest to train up on other skills,” Alyssa Cook, a senior managing consultant at hiring and staffing firm Beacon Hill, previously told Fortune. A report released by Microsoft and LinkedIn last year found that 71% of leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills, as compared to a more experienced one without them. But even beyond technical know-how, experts say the right mindset can make the biggest difference. “We’re not just looking for people who know the tools,” Alejandro Castellano, CEO of automation firm Caddi, previously told Fortune. “We’re looking for those who are curious, adaptable, and thoughtful about how they use AI. That mindset makes the biggest difference.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's meteoric rise and the mayoral election victory have raised a question - Will he run for the Presidential post in 2028? No, Mamdani cannot become the US President. Mamdani's eligibility is barred by Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, a law that has historically prevented others like Elon Musk and Arnold Schwarzenegger from seeking the presidency.

Title: What Amazon’s Corporate Layoffs Signal for IT Leaders

Getty Images/iStockphoto On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced 14,000 corporate job cuts marking the company's largest single-announcement layoff at the time. Unlike previous cuts framed around economic uncertainty, this corporate workforce restructuring was largely tied to AI-related transformation. The October Amazon layoffs span business units including AWS, Devices, Prime Video, advertising, logistics and HR. This follows broader tech industry AI focused restructuring, as companies like Salesforce and Microsoft are also among the big names reducing headcount in 2025. For IT leaders, the layoffs are a cause for concern as the impact of AI begins to manifest on the future of work and what it all means for digital transformation strategy. Amazon framed the layoffs around reducing bureaucracy, flattening organizational layers and shifting resources to AI infrastructure investments. Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti wrote in a statement that this generation of AI is "the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet" and emphasized that the company needs to be organized more leanly with fewer layers. CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in a June 2025 memo that the company would need fewer people doing some jobs as AI capabilities expanded. The connection between AI productivity and these job cuts is tenuous at best according to analysts. Amazon's job cuts are absolutely not a leading indicator and any C-suite that treats it as one is making a serious strategic misreading, according to Nate Suda, senior director analyst at Gartner. "Amazon’s actions are not representative of a widespread AI-driven productivity gain," Suda said. "The data is unequivocal: nearly four in five layoffs in the first half of 2025 were entirely unrelated to AI, and less than 1% were a direct result of AI productivity." Amazon's move is what Gartner calls a strategic "talent remix." The company is repositioning full-time employees, not eliminating them because AI made their roles obsolete. "These layoffs are a strategic reallocation of human capital to cut costs in some areas to fund high-priority, capital-intensive AI and cloud-computing investments," Suda said. The goal is to free up resources to build and sell AI services, he explained. Dave Nicholson, chief advisor at Futurum, agreed with this interpretation. "Very few of these job cuts can be attributed directly to efficiencies gained by the use of artificial intelligence," Nicholson said. "This is a preemptive effort to reorganize in support of their efforts to deliver AI services to industry." Chris Campbell, CIO at DeVry University, has watched budgets move from generalist corporate roles toward data, automation and platform engineering. However, CIOs should interpret Amazon's corporate layoffs as a signal to recompose rather than one to cut. "The future IT organization will be smaller, sharper and more specialized, with teams that know how to work alongside AI rather than compete with it, " Campbell said. There are numerous implications that Amazon's corporate layoffs have for organizations' design, governance and risk. Governance implications. Removing management layers eliminates more than bureaucracy. When organizations flatten management layers in pursuit of organizational agility, they often focus on speed and efficiency while systematically underestimating governance and risk implications. AI changes no aspects of flattening organizations in a meaningful way when it comes to fundamental governance risks, according to Nicholson. When organizations demand more productivity from an individual, regardless of the tools that individual uses, they are at risk for over-subscription.Risk of over-lean structures. According to Suda, the single greatest AI-driven automation risk is what he calls "experience starvation." AI assistants empower senior staff to accomplish more tasks independently without needing junior staff, he said. While AI can augment this work, it cannot create the expertise of discernment that comes with experience. In effect, companies are automating the future leadership of their own organizations out of existence. Change management risk. The biggest mistake organizations risk making is cutting the experts who make automation work, according to Campbell. "When organizations lose subject-matter specialists who understand exceptions and edge cases, they end up automating broken processes," he said. Regulatory and compliance implications. For regulated industries, the implications are even more critical. Financial services, healthcare and other sectors with audit, security, privacy or oversight requirements cannot simply flatten structures without ensuring that accountability mechanisms remain intact. The question is not whether a leaner design is more efficient in theory, but whether it can maintain the institutional controls the risk profile demands Many organizations approach workforce planning in the AI era by asking which roles can be automated, which in turn can lead to workforce reductions. While intuitive, this question fundamentally oversimplifies the challenge. "The binary of automation versus people is a misframed trap that leads to failed initiatives," according to Suda. The strategic analysis must be at the process level, not the individual level. Task-level assessment methodologyIT leaders should focus on task automation rather than role automation, according to Mark Moccia, vice-president and research director at Forrester. He offered a practical framework for workforce assessment: Inventory tasks by automation suitability: First focus on tasks that are repeatable with low variability. Ones that require more human judgement and have more possible outcomes should be targeted last. Apply weighted criteria: Rank tasks by highest business benefit, lowest error risk and custom organizational priorities. Determine role implications: Only consider broad role changes after task-level analysis. Futurum's Nicholson offers a practical decision framework: "Would I bet my job on the output from this AI tool?" If the answer is no, the task still requires human judgment, oversight or validation. This simple test exposes the gap between AI capability and AI reliability. Many tools can produce outputs that look plausible but contain subtle errors, omissions or hallucinations. Deploying these tools without human oversight creates risk. Maintaining oversight requires retaining human expertise. Identifying AI roles for workforce planning Gartner's Suda has a sophisticated framework for workforce planning based on three distinct patterns organizations create with AI: Experience starvation: AI empowers senior experts to work independently, reducing mentorship opportunities. The strategy here is more on hiring avoidance rather than headcount reduction. Experience compression: AI upskills junior staff in low-to-mid complexity roles. This is the only pattern that can lead to the "reduce headcount" strategy. But this is proving highly elusive as Gartner sees it successfully done in fewer than 1% of cases. Experience redistribution: Pivoting to AI-centric business models, as Amazon demonstrates. The strategy here is to capture new markets rather than improving productivity. Reskilling and redeployment strategy For organizations pursuing workforce changes, reskilling becomes critical, according to Campbell. Organizations should emphasize internal mobility, retraining and retention of institutional memory. "Fix the process before you automate it," he said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability: data quality, training, governance, so the gains actually stick." Reskilling efforts are lagging, Nicholson said. "The go-to answer seems to be to cut staff, see what happens, then patch the holes where necessary with AI-skilled labor," he said. "This reactive approach creates precisely the disruption and knowledge loss organizations can least afford." Budgeting for upskilling Investment in people skills must parallel investment in AI technology, according to Campbell. Roughly a third of an organization's AI program budget should go to people through upskilling, reskilling, change management and new hybrid roles like automation engineers and data translators. "When that share falls too low, adoption and governance tend to suffer," he said. Amazon's workforce restructuring is occurring alongside massive capital investments in computing infrastructure, data centers and AI capabilities. This apparent contradiction -- cutting corporate headcount while increasing technology spending -- reveals the fundamental economics of AI transformation. CapEx and OpEx trade-offs The shift from operational expenditure on people to capital expenditure on infrastructure changes cost structures fundamentally. Building computing, storage and network capabilities for enterprise AI requires substantial upfront investment. Traditional IT cost optimization assumes quick labor savings, but AI transformation may take years to materialize, if it materializes at all The key question is whether the organizations can quantitatively tie investments to business value achieved, Moccia said. "Is that the right use case that will bring the most value?" he said. "If not, focus investments elsewhere." Legacy architecture and modernization Organizations with decades of accumulated systems face stark choices. They can continue supporting legacy infrastructure with existing headcount, invest in modernization to enable AI and automation or attempt a hybrid approach that creates complexity and integration challenges. The Amazon corporate layoffs context suggests the company is betting on modern, AI-centric architecture over maintaining legacy systems. For most enterprises, the calculation differs. Legacy systems often contain decades of business logic that would be expensive and risky to rebuild. Operational risk and resilience Infrastructure must scale in tandem with organizational capability to manage it. When infrastructure scales faster than headcount, operational risk increases. CIOs must model scenarios where infrastructure demands grow faster than automation delivers labor savings. The gap creates pressure on remaining staff, which can lead to burnout, knowledge loss through attrition and reduced capacity to handle exceptions. Monitoring and observability become more critical as organizations become leaner. Automated systems must provide visibility into operations that previously relied on human monitoring. When issues arise, remaining staff need sophisticated tools to diagnose and remediate quickly. Budget planning: From staffing to infrastructure The strategic framework should start with business value and work backward to resource allocation. Starting with headcount reduction targets and hoping value follows inverts the logic. Amazon's infrastructure investments make strategic sense because the company builds products to sell. For most enterprises, the calculus differs. Infrastructure must enable better business outcomes, not simply replicate existing outcomes with different cost structures. "Fix the process before you automate it," Campbell said. "Keep the human expertise that helps automation learn and adapt. And use part of the savings to build capability—data quality, training, governance—so the gains actually stick." Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mike Kostersitz spent 31 years building a career at Microsoft. Then, at age 60, he had to do something he hadn't done in decades: Find a job. In May, Kostersitz, a principal product manager lead working on Azure, said his team had a meeting with a senior leader that seemed to go well. But the following morning, he noticed a high-priority meeting had been added to his calendar — and it didn't bring good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said Kostersitz, who lives in Washington state. His manager and two of his direct reports were also affected, along with about 6,000 others. Kostersitz said the layoff came as a total surprise, so he took the rest of the week to process it before beginning his job search. Over the last five months, he's landed interviews with a handful of companies, including Nvidia and Nike. He said there's one opportunity he's optimistic about, but that he still hasn't secured a job. Kostersitz is among thousands of Microsoft workers who've been laid off over the past year. A company spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes. Microsoft isn't the only large tech company laying off workers. Amazon, Meta, and Google have also cut jobs. While overall layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a hiring slowdown across the industry has made it more challenging for many to secure new roles. In a challenging environment, some workers are considering options outside Big Tech — whether taking a role at a smaller company, starting a business, or retiring early. Kostersitz shared how he approached his first job search in decades. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: In the days after his layoff, Kostersitz said his initial instinct wasn't to be angry with Microsoft. He'd spent more than half his life at the company and had built many connections there. However, he wished the news had been delivered more personally. "After 31 years, you would expect at least your manager or your VP or somebody to come to you and say, 'Hey Mike, this is going to happen and here is why.'" Still, Kostersitz said he was grateful for Microsoft's "55 and 15" policy, which allows long-tenured employees who are at least 55 years old and have spent at least 15 consecutive years at the company to have their stock grants continue vesting even after their employment ends. His Microsoft stock and savings gave him time to look for a new role, but he knew that cushion wouldn't last forever. Kostersitz said he and his wife can get by financially for about two years without tapping into their retirement accounts — thanks to savings, severance pay, and Microsoft stock. As he struggled to find work, Kostersitz said he began thinking about whether an early retirement could be an option. Now 60, he'd tentatively planned to retire around 67, though he was open to working longer. However, he concluded that retiring now would be financially challenging for him and his wife. "Technically, we could retire," he said. "Would it be a huge change of lifestyle? Absolutely." Given that he'd spent the prior three decades at Microsoft, Kostersitz initially felt like a fish out of water in the job market. Over the past two decades, he'd built teams — reviewing résumés, interviewing candidates, and making hiring decisions. But being on the other side of the table was unfamiliar. So his first step was to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn, draft cover letters, and optimize his materials for applicant tracking systems. In addition to hiring a private coach, Kostersitz said Microsoft provided a career advisor as part of its layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Kostersitz began applying for jobs, targeting director-level roles in product or program management. He applied to tech companies like Google and Apple, as well as to tech roles at non-tech firms like Nordstrom. He said he tried to secure referrals at some companies — and got one from a Nvidia employee that helped him land an interview — but said he struggled to get traction. Kostersitz said one challenge during interviews is figuring out which parts of his career to highlight. He said he frequently gets "tell me about a time when" questions, and while he has decades of experience, it's difficult to know which examples will resonate. "It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?" he said. Despite these obstacles, Kostersitz hasn't given up. He said the Microsoft-provided advisor encouraged him to stick with his current strategy — and emphasized that job hunting in today's market is, in some ways, a test of endurance. "They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Jump to

Karishma Mandal wanted to land an AI role at a big-name company, so she designed a job search strategy she hoped would help her stand out. Throughout her search, she'd grown confident in the merits of two tactics: being among the first to apply for roles and submitting applications directly through company websites, not job boards. "You have to be early, you have to go through the direct website, and you have to get a referral if you can," said the 29-year-old. Mandal's strategies seemed to pay off. She landed interviews with Uber, Meta, and Amazon — and an offer from Salesforce, where she started full-time in January as an AI-focused product manager in San Francisco. Mandal is among the job seekers who've embraced a growing number of job search hacks that have gained traction. Over the past year, Business Insider has spoken with dozens of job seekers who've relied not only on conventional approaches, such as crafting strong résumés and securing referrals, but also on less-proven tactics. In a competitive hiring landscape, applicants are willing to try just about anything. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, companies are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013, largely due to tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption. In this environment, job seekers are throwing strategies at the wall and hoping they stick. Job applicants rarely know exactly why they were passed over for one role or landed an interview for another. As a result, it's just as hard to debunk some job search strategies as it is to prove they can actually work. Business Insider asked career experts from LinkedIn and Indeed to weigh in on the effectiveness of some of the most commonly cited strategies — and whether they're worth your time. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year. Share your story, whether you found a job or are still looking, by filling out a form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.

Read more on the topic: Mandal thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role to ensure hiring managers see her application. Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed, said it's common for employers to review applications in the order they're submitted, and that some may stop reviewing candidates or close a posting after reaching a certain number of applicants. "I definitely think applying early can increase your visibility," she said. Catherine Fisher, a career expert at LinkedIn, said that applying to a job within 10 minutes of receiving a LinkedIn alert — notifications users can set up for specific types of roles — can increase a person's chances of hearing back by up to four times. She said some recruiters may be working under tight timelines and begin contacting qualified applicants as soon as they find them. Despite the benefits of applying early, both experts emphasized the importance of submitting a quality application — not just a quick one. After earning her master's degree and struggling to land a job, Preeti Ladwa applied to roles between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. every weekday. Her rationale: Recruiters would review recent applications first when they logged on in the morning. Ladwa believes this strategy helped her land a job as a technical projects manager. "I didn't want my résumé to get buried under hundreds of others," she said. Rathod said she's not aware of any data supporting the value of early-morning applications, but believes it's smart to apply during business hours. Some recruiters receive alerts when new applications arrive, she said, and if those come in during the workday — while they're actively reviewing candidates — they may be more likely to give them a closer look. By contrast, applications submitted after hours might get lost in a larger batch of overnight submissions. However, Fisher said she's skeptical that applying at a specific time of day makes much of a difference. She believes it's more important for job seekers to pick a consistent time to submit applications — one that helps them establish a routine and stay committed to the process. "I don't think there's a magic hour to apply," she said. When Ryan Hemenway began looking for a new field scientist job in 2023, he struggled to gain traction, so he decided to shift his approach. While he continued browsing job postings on ZipRecruiter and Indeed, he stopped applying through those platforms and instead submitted applications directly through company websites. He'd heard this might boost his chances of getting noticed, so he decided to give it a shot, in addition to his other search strategies. A few months later, he landed a new role. Rathod said she believes it's a common misconception that job seekers gain an edge by applying directly on a company's website. She said it's likely based on the belief that applications submitted through job platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed are placed in a separate "bucket" from those submitted directly — and that applications in this bucket are less likely to be prioritized. In reality, she said, many employers have integrated their hiring systems with job platforms, so applications typically end up in the same pipeline. "There's not going to be a distinction to the recruiter on whether you applied on the website or on a job platform," she said. She added that as long as a job seeker is applying through a reputable platform, the method of submission is unlikely to affect their chances. Mike Kostersitz, 60, has been job hunting since being laid off by Microsoft in May. In an effort to gain traction, he's worked with a career advisor that Microsoft provided as part of his layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003. Fisher said she generally doesn't think having extensive experience is a drawback for employers. However, she recommends focusing the bulk of an application on recent, relevant experience — and keeping descriptions of older roles brief, or potentially leaving them out if they don't directly strengthen the application. "It doesn't mean cutting off half of your career," she said. "I just think it means looking back at when your experience stops adding value." One of the most common strategies cited by job seekers is meticulously aligning their résumés and cover letters with keywords from the job description — often with the help of AI tools — in the hope of impressing applicant tracking systems (ATS), which are often the first to review applications. Both experts agreed this is a strategy worth investing in. "Matching your keywords to your résumé is really important," Rathod said. "An ATS is going to scan for those keywords, and if it sees them, you're more likely to move forward in the process." Fisher wouldn't advise applicants to embellish their résumés just to align with job postings, but she recommends taking the time to ensure they include all of their experiences that match the role. She said that some applicants may check more boxes than they initially realize. When they do check those boxes, she said, it's worth using the precise language from the job description to better align with what ATS are scanning for. "It's not about beating the system," she said. "You're just making sure that your skills and experience align with what the company is looking for." While many of the strategies discussed above may be worth investing in, Rathod said one of her top pieces of advice is not to overlook the importance of interview preparation. "People are probably putting a lot of effort into tailoring their résumés and getting those interviews, but the interview is when you really get to shine," she said. "Job seekers need to approach interviews with that same sense of preparation." Jump to

Title: 'Musk Will Get Richer, Millions To Lose Jobs': Nobel Laureate Warns Against AI Risks

Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist, has reiterated his concerns about the risks of massive job loss amid the rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). He also cautioned against the growth of AI companies and tech billionaires at the cost of millions of workers. Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI”, remarked that although some economists argue past technological shifts both eliminated and created employment, AI-driven technology may not follow the same path. He expressed his doubts over job creation while highlighting the potential risks of massive unemployment. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned during an interview with Bloomberg TV's Wall Street Week. “The reason it's bad is because of the way society's organised. So that Musk will get richer and a lot of people get unemployed and Musk won't care. I'm using Musk as a sort of stand-in. That's not on AI, that's on how we organise society,” he added. According to Bloomberg, the four major AI hyperscalers— Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon— are projected to raise their capital spending from $360 billion this year to $420 billion in the next fiscal year. “I believe that to make money you're going to have to replace human labour,” Hinton said. “My worry is that the obvious way to make money out of it, apart from charging fees to use the chatbots, is by replacing jobs. The way you make a company more profitable is to replace the workers with something cheaper. And I think that’s a big part of what’s driving it.” “Some economists say these big changes always create new jobs. It’s not clear to me that this will,” he added. AI can do “tremendous good” in healthcare and education, Hinton said. On being questioned if he would rather have the development of AI halted altogether, he was noncommittal. “It's not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things. It’s a difficult decision, because it can do tremendous good in health care and education." Hinton’s observations come amid widespread job reductions in the tech sector, with Amazon recently revealing plans to cut at least 14,000 corporate positions. While many leading tech firms have refrained from explicitly attributing layoffs to AI, industry experts and executives are increasingly raising concerns over hiring freezes and workforce downsizing due to the adoption of AI-driven technology.

Title: IBM to layoff thousands of employees before end of year

Published Nov 04, 2025 at 05:41 PM EST Reporter, Consumer & Social Trends IBM announced Tuesday it would be laying off thousands of employees before the end of the year. The job losses will amount to a “low single-digit percentage” of the global workforce. For a 1 percent cut, that would mean the loss of 2,700 jobs. Many companies have implemented layoffs as a way to boost profits and increase efficiency as they head into new financial quarters. Meta, for instance, announced it plans to cut roughly 600 roles from its AI team as business priorities shift. While IBM had 270,000 global workers at the end of 2025, a single-digit percentage layoff would mean thousands of employees would no longer have jobs at the end of the year. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” a company spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.” Many tech companies have reduced their employee headcounts, focusing on artificial intelligence tools to boost productivity even with fewer workers. In October, Amazon announced layoffs for 14,000 corporate employees, and Meta will be letting 600 workers in its AI unit go. IBM previously reported a 10 percent jump in revenue from software last month, but the larger sector is facing uncertainty from several directions, experts say. “The current environment is filled with uncertainty, and many companies may feel like this is the perfect opportunity to get rid of what some believe to be pandemic bloat,” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek. “Many companies were forced to keep staff for longer than they had hoped and perhaps this would allow them to thin their workforce.” Newsweek reached out to IBM for comment via email. Matt Bruno, chief revenue officer at Laivly, told Newsweek: “For the past few years, the industry’s been focused on building large, experimental AI teams. Now the emphasis is shifting to precision and measurable impact. We’ve seen that same evolution on the business side, especially in contact centers, where companies are moving from pilots to embedding AI directly into workflows that help agents make better decisions and improve performance. It’s fascinating to see that same focus on outcomes now extending to the model makers themselves.” Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “While some will lay the blame on AI for these cuts, it’s difficult to say based on the initial announcement if that’s in fact the case. The workforce in the United States for IBM actually remains flat year-over-year despite the cuts. Still, this is the latest in a series of major corporate job reductions that will further stoke fears of how technological advancements are going to lead to more job losses.” Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: “The tech industry is accelerating toward AI adoption, and with that comes a belief in new efficiencies that allow companies to do more with less. Some divisions are being downsized because they rely on older, outdated technologies that no longer fit the direction the industry is heading. Others are being restructured or folded into different parts of the company.” Business experts say workers should expect a continuing spree of layoff announcements as we near the end of the year. “As we move toward the end of the year, expect more layoff announcements,” Thompson said. “Year-end is traditionally when companies evaluate performance, tighten operations, and adjust forecasts for the year ahead.” © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Nov 05, 2025, 07:00 AM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 08:31 AM BENGALURU - IBM will cut roles this quarter, the company said on Nov 4, potentially impacting thousands of employees while it shifts focus towards its high-margin software segment, as Wall Street hones in on the company’s ability to benefit from artificial intelligence-linked cloud demand. “We routinely review our workforce… and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement. “In the fourth quarter, we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce.” A massive supplier of technology to businesses, IBM joins other companies including Amazon, Meta and Google that have made recent staffing cuts as they race to invest more in the AI boom. Many executives have predicted more efficiency gains as the technology assists workers with coding and other tasks. Under chief executive Arvind Krishna, IBM has doubled down on software as it looks to tap increased spending on cloud services through its “Red Hat” division, as businesses integrate AI technology. However, IBM in October recorded a slowdown in growth in the key cloud software segment, raising alarm bells among investors betting heavily on Big Blue’s ability to benefit more from booming cloud services demand. Its shares, which have risen over 35 per cent in 2025, were down close to 2 per cent on Nov 4. IBM employed about 270,000 workers as at the end of 2024. Some US workers may be affected by the job reductions, but employment in the country is anticipated to remain roughly the same year over year, IBM said.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/04/2025 3:02:33 PM PST by SunkenCiv What's really happening with AI and Amazon's layoffs? The common story is that automation killed 30,000 jobs -- but the reality is more complicated. In this video, I share the inside scoop on what's actually driving these cuts and what it reveals about the AI economy: Why Amazon's profits depend on AWS, not retail operations How surging GPU demand is reshaping corporate AI strategy What Wall Street misunderstands about "AI automation" narratives Where media coverage keeps missing the real AI growth signal For operators and teams, the takeaway is clear: AI isn't replacing labor yet -- it's reallocating capital, and understanding that shift will define who wins the next decade.

By stealing web content, AIs are also stealing ad revenues from the websites they rip off. So it’s Google’s $200b plus whatever else other websites are getting in ad revenues.

Title: The tech industry came for Steam and whiffed so hard that it's had to admit that it didn't even really like making games in the first place

Amazon's New World wouldn't have to die if the company actually wanted to be an MMO developer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon didn't spin up its game development studios a decade ago just to be a regular game publisher: It wanted to take on Steam, but missed its shot by such a wide margin that we didn't even realize that's what it was trying to do. Now it seems to have at least partially moved on from that ambition, and one big consequence is the end of historical-fantasy MMO New World, which will cease to receive updates and eventually be put to rest. This week: Put off installing Arc Raiders, but was finally convinced to take the plunge by those cool leaping bug bots. What's maddening is that New World itself was not a failure. It was a beneficiary of the early pandemic boom in online gaming, hitting a wild Steam concurrents peak of 913,634 after it launched in 2021. The MMO settled into much lower numbers by early 2022, but was far from a flop, and got an expansion in 2023 and a console port in 2024. New World presumably hasn't been raking in microtransaction cash recently, but when so many MMOs never even make it out of development or blow up on the launch pad, it was at least something: a foothold in an extremely hard-to-break-into space that could be parlayed into more success in the future. But Amazon—at least at the executive level—was clearly never really interested in being an MMO developer. It wanted to own PC gaming, and that's not working out, so now it's turning its attention to bleak games like one where an "AI-powered" Snoop Dogg plays the part of Judge Judy. Google was faster to make its retreat from the same ambition, closing its in-house studio before it ever released a game after it became clear that Stadia was not going to become the next Steam anytime soon. Microsoft, however, still aspires to sit atop the PC gaming throne. It's releasing games on Steam again, but it's also betting big on Game Pass, and you're probably not imagining covetousness in Microsoft CEO Sataya Nadella's recent comment that "Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of [Windows] and done a very successful job of it." (Don't get me started on the term "Xbox PC," which is now appearing in my inbox weekly.) Maybe one day some pure-of-heart PC gamer actually will topple Gaben from his throne, but in the meantime, it's frustrating to watch the tech industry use game developers as a means to impossible ends, tossing them to the curb even when they do make popular games, because for the most part these companies don't actually want to make games, but to bask in recurring revenue. Well, sorry tech industry, but the period where you could take over PC gaming by making one killer app is over. The killer app was Counter-Strike. Even with all the might of Fortnite behind it, the best Epic Games could do was to spend a fortune promoting a modest Steam competitor, which has really been the most honest attempt to take it on. (And at least Epic didn't try to acquire the whole industry, instead throwing money at independent developers like Remedy to support its aims.) Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. What I love to see are game developers whose existence is justified just by making games that people want to buy, not by their role in a plan for PC gaming domination. It's mildly heartening that, at least from the outside, some of Microsoft's studios appear to be operating under that justification. In February, Obsidian outlined a plan to keep making RPGs for 100 years by not chasing unrealistic profit margins, and Double Fine is still making cool, niche games. But it's impossible to look at Microsoft's recent history of studio closures, layoffs, and unrealistic profit expectations and think that these legendary studios are safe from LinkedIn-brained executives who claim that the best way to innovate in gaming "is to have good margins." What happens if Game Pass isn't the future? Nothing good for Microsoft's studios, and the irony is that PC gaming itself is bigger than ever. Games like New World don't have to be abandoned if the companies that make them actually want to be in the business of making games. Let's hope that, unlike Amazon, some part of Microsoft still does.

Title: Gen Z job openings have dwindled since 2022 as AI slams entry-level roles: study

The numbers are in — and it looks like artificial intelligence is coming for Gen Z jobs. US job postings for young adults aged 22 to 25 – the heart of the job-seeking segment of Generation Z – have plunged 13% since 2022 across AI-exposed industries, according to a recent Stanford University report. It also happens that 2022 is when ChatGPT was first launched – sparking an epic race across corporate America to find ways to use AI to increase efficiencies and otherwise revamp their operations. Major US employers – including Amazon, UPS and Target – have cut thousands of jobs this year as they ramp up automation efforts. On Tuesday, IBM said it will lay off about 1% of its workforce in the current quarter, or approximately 2,700 jobs. “It disproportionately hurts corporate America jobs, specifically around heavy data entry and what would be mundane tasks,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “I think Gen Z could be impacted more than others.” Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on artificial intelligence as US firms hope to beat China in the AI race and reap significant cost savings. The downside of those cost savings is layoffs – particularly hitting jobs like consultants, accounting, finance and entry-level roles that typically appeal to Gen Z graduates, Ives said. Roles that are seen as pathways for young workers in white-collar jobs are in “substantial” decline, the Stanford report warned. But AI will also lead to some job creation in roles like software engineering, development and manufacturing, he added. “AI is definitely playing a role in a tough job market, especially entry level jobs,” Ives told The Post. “I think companies won’t admit it, but it’s definitely playing a bigger role.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Tech firms have announced huge layoffs this year, though few have attributed the cuts to AI. Last week, Amazon launched a round of 14,000 job cuts in an effort to “reduce bureaucracy.” In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce – over the coming weeks, sources told Reuters. It plans to avoid hiring more than half a million jobs over the coming years by automating its warehouses with the latest robots, according to a New York Times report. Ultimately, the firm’s robotics team is looking to automate 75% of operations, the report said. Amazon denied the claims in the report. A spokesperson added that the e-commerce giant plans to hire 250,000 people for the upcoming holiday season, but did not share how many of those positions will be permanent. UPS recently announced 34,000 job cuts, while Target launched a layoff round impacting 1,800 roles. These cuts could grow worse over the next decade, as AI and automation could wipe out nearly 100 million jobs, according to a report released by Sen. Bernie Sanders (l-Vt.). Some Gen Zers might be looking to pivot to industries that are more immune to shocks from tech advancements – and healthcare has emerged as a bright spot. Home health aides are among the roles least impacted by the rise of AI, with nearly 740,000 new positions expected to open up over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although it only has a median annual pay of about $35,000, the role has a low barrier to entry, often requiring only a high school diploma and brief on-the-job training. Over the next decade, the US is expected to see about 1.9 million healthcare job openings over the next year, according to the BLS. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse anesthetists and health services managers offer higher median pay and long-term stability, though these paths typically require more advanced degrees. Even techies like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis have agreed that healthcare remains fairly safe from the AI chopping block. “There’s a lot of things that we won’t want to do with a machine,” Hassabis previously said. “You wouldn’t want a robot nurse – there’s something about the human empathy aspect of that care that’s particularly humanistic.” Advertisement

IBM layoffs: Amid over one lakh job cuts in major tech companies across the world, International Business Machines Corp (IBM) is set to reduce thousands of roles to focus on software growth, reported Bloomberg News. The job cuts will take place in this quarter as the company shifts focus to software and service. “We routinely review our workforce through this lens and at times rebalance accordingly,” the report said, quoting a company spokesperson. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce.” According to Reuters, IBM last month recorded a slowdown in growth in the key cloud software segment. Its shares, which have risen over 35% this year, were down close to 2% on Tuesday. Some US workers may be affected by the job reductions, but employment in the country is anticipated to remain roughly the same year over year, the spokesperson said. The company employed about 270,000 workers as of the end of 2024. In recent months, several tech companies, including Amazon, TCS and Microsoft among others have announced layoffs as the focus shifts to artificial intelligence. According to Layoffs.fyi - a platform that tracks global tech industry layoffs - over 112,732 tech workers have been laid off across 218 tech companies in 2025 alone. Last week, Amazon announced that it will reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 people, with more cuts expected next year. The online retailer began laying off employees across multiple divisions as part of a plan. Amazon will offer most affected workers 90 days to look for a new role internally and said its recruiting teams would prioritize those candidates, reported Reuters. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm's total workforce count witnessed a 19,755 fall to 593,314 as of the second quarter of the financial year 2025-26. Microsoft, the second most valuable publicly listed company after Nvidia globally, has so far laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025. However, CEO Satya Nadella recently said that the tech giant plans to expand its workforce, but the focus will now be on a more strategic and leveraged approach post-AI revolution.

Title: Just Cause 5 a “No-go” as Avalanche Studios faces talent drain amid Contraband’s cancellation

Fans of the Just Cause series will have to say their goodbyes to Rico Rodriguez as Just Cause 5 won’t be happening. Creator of the Just Cause Series Christofer Sundberg announced that Just Cause 5 at Avalanche Studios is basically a “no-go.” Co-founder and creator of Just Cause, Sundberg left Avalanche Studios in 2019. After gazing at leaked screenshots of the now-canceled Contraband game, he said, “#JC5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.” According to Sundberg, he made a “qualified guess”, but later followed up with replies and revealed that deeper issues plague Avalanche Studios, specifically talent drain that began right during the troubled production of Just Cause 4. Just Cause 4 was released nearly seven years ago on December 4, 2018, and received mixed reviews from the get-go, mainly due to glitches, weather mechanics, and a pivot from the franchise’s core chaotic mayhem. However, post-launch updates appeased longtime fans of the series. In his post, Sundberg took partial blame for the troubled development of Just Cause 4, stating: The problems with JC4 were partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles, and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise. However, fans aren’t giving up on the Just Cause series. One user declared that Just Cause 5 might save the company. However, Sundberg shot him down and said, “I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off, and make games; the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not fit into one.” Unfortunately, Avalanche’s problems have only mounted since the studio halted development on Contraband, which was supposed to be a 1970s co-op smuggling game. The project was initially proposed by Sundberg and his team to Microsoft earlier in 2017. However, Microsoft’s restructuring plans rolled in, leading to the cancellation of Contraband and massive layoffs at Avalanche. By late September, Avalanche announced that it would close down its Liverpool office and cut down staff in Malmo and Stockholm, amid “industry challenges.” Buy Just Cause 4 on Amazon CHSundberg – X

Title: Is AI to blame for recent job cuts?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Numerous companies have called out AI for being the reason for the culling With layoffs hitting global industries across their workforces, companies are claiming a new culprit: the rise of artificial intelligence. Numerous brands, including major tech corporations like Amazon, have pointed to AI as the reason for the most recent wave of job cuts. But some labor analysts claim that blaming AI is simply a way for these companies to avoid taking responsibility when they downsize. Even as companies have been “blaming the promise of productivity with artificial intelligence for their decisions,” there is “uneven evidence that the promised cost-savings from AI are actually worth what companies are putting into it,” said NBC News. This has left some people “questioning whether AI could be serving as a fig leaf for companies that are laying off employees for old-fashioned reasons,” such as a company’s poor financial performance. It is “much easier for a company to say, ‘We are laying workers off because we’re realizing AI-related efficiencies’ than to say, ‘We’re laying people off because we’re not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,’” David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said to NBC. Even if AI wasn’t the reason for a particular layoff, companies would “be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI.” Escape your echo chamber.

The most notable example of this is Amazon, which has announced a new wave of 14,000 job cuts. This “came just a few months after CEO Andrew Jassy said the rollout of AI technology was likely to spell job cuts,” said Al Jazeera. But while experts are skeptical, AI “may be” at fault for the Amazon cuts. This “latest move signals that Amazon is likely realizing enough AI-driven productivity gains within corporate teams to support a substantial reduction in force,” Sky Canaves, an eMarketer analyst, said to Reuters. Despite these changes at Amazon, many people have “voiced skepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment,” said BBC News. There is a “real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labor market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements,” Martha Gimbel, the executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University, said to the BBC. Whether AI is truly at fault or not, there’s no question that the technology is replacing certain jobs. In July 2025, Microsoft released a research paper outlining 40 occupations the company thinks could be outsourced to AI. At the top of the list were interpreters and translators, followed by historians, passenger attendants, sales representatives, writers and customer service representatives. The job that Microsoft felt was the safest from AI was a phlebotomist, followed by nursing assistants, waste removal workers, painters, embalmers and plant operators. Understanding the “effects of AI on the economy” will become “one of society’s most important” efforts, the paper said. This has especially been true in the “last several years,” as “generative AI has come to the fore as the next candidate general purpose technology, capable of improving or speeding up tasks as varied as medical diagnosis and software development.” Its extensive reach has already been “reflected in the astounding rate of AI adoption.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Title: Inside David Ellison’s Dramatic First 100 Days at Paramount: Courting Tom Cruise Blockbusters, Forging Ties With Trump and Daring Anyone Else to Buy Warner Bros. Discovery

David Ellison isn’t afraid to get in the ring. As the Paramount chief builds a Hollywood juggernaut that could soon swallow Warner Bros. Discovery whole, a different type of construction is taking place 3,000 miles away: Sources say that President Donald Trump has greenlit plans to host one of the first UFC fights under Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal with the MMA league on the lawn of the White House. Dignitaries from around the world will attend a dinner and then head to the Octagon, the eight-sided ring where the main event will play out. Trump and UFC CEO Dana White are spearheading the telecast. The discussed date is June 14, 2026 — which coincides with Trump’s 80th birthday. Related Stories Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo Do Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland Proud With 'Happy' Duet on 'Wicked' TV Special: The History Behind the Mellifluous Mashup How To Watch 'Wicked: One Wonderful Night' Live Online White House spokesperson Anna Kelly says the fight will be “a spectacular event” that will “celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great country.” Popular on Variety While the spectacle might sound like a discarded scene from the 2006 dystopian comedy “Idiocracy,” it provides a glimpse into Ellison’s rising empire, one that skews alpha male and that some fear will entwine the studio’s content more closely with MAGA messaging. In rapid-fire fashion, the 42-year-old Ellison has become show business’ ultimate disruptor. The industry’s first millennial mogul wants to change the DNA of Hollywood while building a new type of entertainment leviathan out of the husk of a once-legendary film and television studio. And Paramount, which declined to comment, is just the beginning. “We’re going after Warners,” Ellison told confidants even before the Paramount deal got the Trump administration’s approval. “I want to be in the top three, not the bottom three.” By the accounts of many industry insiders, Ellison has been busy leveraging his family’s extraordinary wealth and access to President Trump to prepare for a buying spree. With the help of his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison (the world’s second-richest person behind Elon Musk), the Silicon Valley scion wants to take on Netflix, Amazon and Apple; in the hypercompetitive Ellison family, there’s no prize for being runner-up. If the Ellisons pull it off, they’ll control a media empire with unprecedented reach and cultural influence. “It’s the Wild West, and these are the new cowboys,” says producer Jon Peters, who ran Sony Pictures from 1989 to 1991. Peters says he has taken a $400 million-plus stake — roughly 4% — in Paramount since it began trading on the Nasdaq as PSKY. “Things have changed,” Peters adds, “and now we’re moving into the biggest revolution that you and I will ever see in our life, which is AI.” When Skydance took over Paramount, it pointedly referred to itself as a media and technology company. Ellison has repeatedly said that he wants to “embrace AI,” and in meetings he alludes to having developed revolutionary ways to understand what consumers want by accessing vast troves of data. He’s fond of boasting that Oracle’s technological know-how will transform Paramount+ from a second-rate app to a dominant player with a better user experience. (Where all that data comes from remains a mystery.) Some industry observers are skeptical that it will be enough to compete with Netflix and its mighty algorithm. They also believe that even if traditional studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. combine, Netflix and the other streaming giants are so much better established that it will be nearly impossible to catch up. “Studios are irrelevant; they’re on the ropes. They’re dinosaurs, and the age of dinosaurs is over,” says Schuyler Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker. “Their only move now is to consolidate, but there’s no hope even if they get bigger. They’re too late to the party.” Not according to David Ellison, who projects an image of Paramount as a land of abundance. He wants “more content, not less,” says one source with direct knowledge of his thinking. The proof is in the mad dash his film chiefs are making to build their slate from its current eight annual releases to 15 by 2026, 17 by 2027 and 18 by 2028. Cindy Holland, who helped Netflix develop its original programming strategy and is now running Paramount’s direct-to-consumer operation, is opening the purse to bring better programming to Paramount+. Hollywood may be wary of the Ellison family. The WGA called the prospect of Paramount buying Warner Bros. Discovery “a disaster for writers, for consumers, and for competition” and vowed to work with regulators to block the merger. But an industry still reeling from the collapse of Peak TV has been reenergized by the emergence of a new, deep-pocketed buyer. And analysts credit Ellison for embracing an expansive vision. “They clearly have a long-term point of view,” says Jessica Reif Ehrlich, Bank of America Securities senior media and entertainment analyst. “They have a plan to invest in more compelling content, and they are executing on it.” Since taking over Paramount, Team Ellison has embraced Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” spending money freely, like purchasing Bari Weiss’ The Free Press — a fledgling Substack-based news outlet — for $150 million. It has also slashed staff and dispensed with top Paramount executives at a dizzying rate, replacing them with executives with unfashionable — by Hollywood standards — viewpoints, from vocal Israel supporters (CBS News editor-in-chief Weiss) to political conservatives (Paramount co-chair Josh Greenstein), and jumped into business with a new brand of power brokers, namely White. Those who remain have faced pointed questions, often delivered in blunt tones, that betray irritation at how inefficiently the new regime feels the legacy media companyhad been run. Taking a page from the MAGA playbook, Ellison doesn’t seem to care about optics. An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. A source close to Paramount says the October layoffs were not motivated by MAGA politics or gender. But Israel is an important issue. Larry Ellison is reportedly a close friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is a prolific donor to Friends of the IDF. Weiss has been so vocal in her support of the country that she faces frequent death threats. She and her wife, The Free Press co-founder Nellie Bowles, require a detail of five bodyguards that costs the studio $10,000-$15,000 a day. There has also been a noticeable step-up in security measures around the company’s executive leadership (one insider says the entire C-suite has received threats). Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. Around the studio lot and offices, open debate about business strategy, even arguments that can grow heated, are more frequent than under the previous regime. Greenstein, a former top Sony executive enlisted to run the studio with Skydance veteran Dana Goldberg, is said to have a differing professional style from his boss, Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who was installed as Paramount’s president. A person who observed them together compares them to “oil and water.” Ellison has not been immune to pushback from his staff. Greenstein and Goldberg tried — and failed — to dissuade their boss from giving Will Smith and his company Westbrook an overall deal with the studio, arguing that the Oscar-slap controversy and a dodgy box office track record would result in more headaches than hits. Despite the disagreements over strategy, there is a shared sense of urgency around the need to fundamentally transform Paramount, as the new executive leadership recognizes it must move fast to pull off its grand plans. In addition to signing talent deals with Smith and Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers behind Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” the team is trying to assemble a slate of films that can attract audiences to theaters at a time when the box office is in a slump. Ellison personally courted “A Complete Unknown”’s James Mangold and is shelling out up to $100 million to produce “High Side,” a motocross thriller that will be the director’s next film with Timothée Chalamet. Insiders at Paramount insist that the film will cost less and no official budget has been set. Some long-gestating productions, such as the Miles Teller sports drama “Winter Games,” have been put into turnaround, while there has also been a focus on reinvigorating certain franchises. The hope is to have a fresh “Star Trek” movie, though the studio has moved on from the idea of bringing back Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the ensemble from the J.J. Abrams reboot. It is also working on sequels to “Top Gun” and “Days of Thunder,” with the films’ star, Tom Cruise, recently visiting the Paramount lot to congratulate the Skydance team on its takeover and to discuss a return to those franchises and other possible collaborations. (Some of the films that Paramount is greenlighting, including a movie about a cowboy and his dog searching for his missing daughter that’s been likened to a Western version of “Taken,” were described as “America-centric” and geared toward the middle of the country.) Not everything has gone smoothly. The Skydance team was shocked when Taylor Sheridan, the creator of many of Paramount+’s biggest franchises, such as “Yellowstone” and “Tulsa King,” defected for a lucrative deal with NBCUniversal. Ellison had spent time cultivating Sheridan, flying down to Texas with Shell, Greenstein and Goldberg, where the new mogul suggested possible shows that could be additions to the Sheridan-verse. The overtures backfired, with Sheridan preferring a less corporate approach. Although Sheridan, whose content plays big in red state America and presumably would have fit in seamlessly with the new mentality, has three years remaining on his deal with Paramount, his exit leaves a big hole. “It’s a huge loss for them,” says Ehrlich. “If you look at Paramount+, [Sheridan] is responsible for 90% of their successful programming.” Before he leaves, though, Sheridan will help Paramount deliver on one of Ellison’s biggest priorities; he’s been tapped to write the screenplay for “Call of Duty,” an adaptation of the popular video game franchise that encapsulates the kind of patriotic, flag-waving films that the studio wants to make. Directing the film is Peter Berg, who recently said on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” “I think Trump’s doing some great things” — the type of sentiment that could land talent on a blacklist anywhere but Paramount. In person, Ellison has an “aw-shucks” demeanor and strikes people who have worked with him as wonky, unfailingly polite and a little shy. But since he took the reins at Paramount, he’s instilled a very different climate from the left-leaning one found at most major studios. Prior to the merger, television sets in executive offices were usually turned to CNBC or CNN. Now, some employees have conspicuously changed the channel to Fox News, according to one executive. Another source, however, disputes this and says most of the offices are still being renovated and have television sets that have yet to be mounted or plugged in. Over on the Melrose lot, Greenstein boasts about hitting the shooting range, while at CBS News’ midtown headquarters, the race and culture unit — formed in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 — has been dissolved. There’s a reason for the cultural shift. After all, Larry Ellison’s loyalty to the president has already paid off. The Trump administration greenlit the Paramount Skydance merger, despite antitrust concerns, and allowed the Oracle co-founder to be part of a consortium to acquire TikTok that also includes conservative-leaning Lachlan Murdoch. Now, Ellison advisers are privately crowing that they are the only viable choice to buy Warner Bros. Discovery given that rivals would face obstacles from U.S. regulators, whereas the Ellisons could get the deal done. Trump already has given Weiss a vote of confidence, saying that CBS News has “great potential” and that he expects coverage to be “fairer” now. For his part, Trump told a press gaggle aboard Air Force One in mid-October that Larry and David Ellison “are friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine.” Then, with a line that could have been lifted from “The Godfather,” the president added, “And they’ll do the right thing.” Most of Hollywood is buzzing about what the U.S. cultural landscape might look like if the Ellisons succeed in acquiring CNN — and the rest of Warner Bros. Discovery. The Ellisons have made two offers for Warner Bros. Discovery after floating a trial balloon in September about its plan to bid, which had the effect of putting the company in play. Netflix is reportedly considering making its own offer, though some industry sources believe the streamer is mostly trying to drive up the price Paramount Skydance will need to pay. The expectation is that the Ellisons will prevail, and when they do, they’ll have access to a far richer and deeper library than the one they control at Paramount. The Burbank studio boasts DC Studios and its arsenal of superheroes, certain rights to “Harry Potter” and HBO, still the preeminent tastemaker in the television world. However, all that premium content might not be enough to resolve the fundamental problems with the business models of legacy media companies like Paramount — namely, that linear broadcast and cable channels still account for as much as 80% of Paramount’s annual revenues. And television is losing audience rapidly to streamers. That’s created the conditions in which two of the five remaining traditional studios feel the pressure to merge — to get bigger in order to withstand the headwinds. “Despite the volatility of the movie industry, for 100 years it was one of the most stable industries in the history of American business,” says Snap chairman and former Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton. “The same six players were there from the very outset, with the possible exception of RKO. And those same players stayed there without consolidation. It was almost impossible to have a new entrant because you needed a big library and distribution, and obviously that took years and years to create. Then technology companies came in. They became incredibly disruptive. That’s in large part the reason why you’re seeing what you’re seeing happening now [with the Ellisons].” The Ellisons should be careful what they wish for; most media mergers ultimately aren’t worth the time and effort. For every smart acquisition, like Disney’s purchase of Marvel, there’s a corporate catastrophe on the scale of AOL Time Warner. Synergies often fail to materialize, and it takes upwards of three years for companies to integrate. David Ellison is aware of that tangled history, telling acquaintances that he doesn’t want any purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery to mirror Disney’s $71.3 billion deal for much of 21st Century Fox — a pact that is now widely considered to have been too costly. “Almost every major media deal has been a disaster,” says Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst with TD Cowen. “People always convince themselves that even though they’ve all blown up in the past, this time it will work for them, and they’re almost always wrong.” While David Ellison is the frontman in the family’s Hollywood forays, there is a sense that he is moving in lockstep with his father, who brings a mentality far different from what has reigned in Hollywood for more than a century — that the mogul with the most content wins. Instead, he follows a different guiding principle. “Larry Ellison has a fundamental belief that the guy with the most data wins,” says Derek Reisfield, the first president of CBS New Media (now CBS Interactive) and co-founder of MarketWatch. “That’s been his mantra at Oracle. That’s what is going on with the Warner Bros. Discovery bid. And Larry wants to salt the earth so the competitors can’t come back. By buying all this now and doing it quickly when he has an advantage, it’s sort of game over for everybody else.” Among Paramount’s competitors, Netflix is said to be most shaken by Ellison’s arrival — and his seemingly endless supply of capital. (A spokesperson for Netflix denies that characterization.) Paramount’s resurgence comes as Netflix is being targeted by the MAGA faithful with calls for consumers to cancel their subscriptions due to what they label as “woke” content aimed at kids. And Wall Street seems to have its concerns, handing Netflix, on Oct. 22, its single worst day since 2022. Whether or not the Ellisons capture the Warners flag, they face morale problems. The first round of layoffs cut deep enough. But another 1,000 pink slips are expected globally in the second round. The prospect of full AI integration spells doom for many at a time when spirits are already low. Some say they could overlook the studio’s Trumpian turn, which could have reverberations right down to the news division. But they are incensed by the casual bloodletting of Oct. 29, carried out in a drip-drip throughout the day, stoking greater anxiety. “I’ve lost a lot of friends. A lot of really great writers and a lot of really great journalists have lost their jobs to pay for Bari’s six bodyguards and $150 million deal,” says a CBS News staffer. “And I think that’s bullshit.” Another Paramount executive was shocked by how coldly the company dispensed with people who had worked there for decades. “They didn’t show a lot of respect,” the exec says. “I’ve been through other mergers, and there’s no other word to describe this one than merciless. It’s a new way of doing business.” The Business of Entertainment

Here is a tally of who's had layoffs in 2025 so far. Global job losses in fashion and footwear are climbing in 2025. Shoe firms and fashion retailers — including Nike, Puma, Saks Global and Target, among others — are cutting jobs as part of a larger trend across corporate America and beyond. So far in 2025, the tally has reached a minimum of 17,267 job cuts. Global shipping and logistics firm United Parcel Service Inc., which ships many of the online shoe orders, conducted sweeping cuts this year that saw 48,000 positions eliminated thus far. UPS is moving more operations toward automation. It also will see a 50 percent cut in its Amazon package volume by the middle of 2026. Related Stories As the Supreme Court Takes Up Trump's Tariffs, What Footwear Firms Should Be Considering, According to Former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross EXCLUSIVE: Clarks and Topologie Reinvent the Torhill Hi With Climbing-inspired Elements And with AI driving some of the change, tech firms have also been reducing their global workforces. Intel is slated to cut 24,000 jobs, while Microsoft is expected to shed 9,000 employees. Consulting firm Accenture is believed to be cutting at least 11,000 this year, mostly in roles that do not match current AI needs. Other sectors are cutting jobs too, Chevron is shedding 8,000 jobs while competitor BP cut 7,700 roles, and beauty firm Estée Lauder is cutting 7,000 positions this year. You May Also Like A report last month from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said there were nearly 950,000 job cuts in the U.S. from January through September, representing the highest year-to-day total since 2020 when nearly 2.1 million cuts were announced and the fifth highest year-to-date total in the 36 years Challenger has reported. It noted that many of the cuts are due to AI and automation gains. A flurry of job elimination announcements in October adds to that 950,000 tally. And while the government sector has born the brunt of the jobs lost thus far, the Challenger report noted that tech and retail have also been impacted. Overall, Challenger said U.S. retailers thus far through September have announced 86,233 job cuts, up 203 percent from the 28,440 cuts announced during the same year-ago period. The tally for U.S. retail does not separate out data either for different retail sectors or by distribution channel. “Now is when we typically see retailers bulk up for the holidays, but so far, plans have been slow to come, reflecting caution. With lower consumer confidence and tariff pressures ahead, we predict the hiring season will be muted,” Challenger’s senior vice president and labor expert Andy Challenger said. Below is the list of fashion firms cutting jobs. Adidas AG Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said in January that the company will shed 500 “obsolete” positions at company headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany. The job cuts weren’t part of any cost-savings plan but aimed at “reducing complexity and ensure sustainable success in the future.” Amazon.com Inc. The online marketplace platform, said in October that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs. It’s the latest in a line of job cuts since the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in the job cuts were an undisclosed number from its Zappos division. Amazon acquired Zappos in July 2009 in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.2 billion. Burberry Group plc The British fashion firm said in May it would eliminate 1,700 jobs, or 18 percent of its worldwide workforce. The move is part of a strategy to cut about $130 million in costs by 2027. Burberry posted an operating loss of 3 million pounds and a 17 percent drop in revenue for the year that ended in March. Carter’s Inc. The company said in October that it would lay off 300 corporate staffers, or 15 percent of its workforce, by the end of this year. The company also said it plans to close 150 North American stores over the next three years, about 50 more doors than initially expected. The cuts were disclosed when the children’s retailer said third quarter profits were down, impacted largely by tariffs. In addition to apparel, the retailer also sells shoes and socks. Hudson’s Bay Co. The Hudson’s Bay retail chain, Canada’s oldest department store for over 350 years, shut down operations in May following the conclusion of its liquidation sale. The shut-down resulted in the loss of 8,347 jobs. Kohl’s Corp. The department store retailer said in late January that it had cut about 10 percent of its corporate jobs. The expectation was that half of those cuts would be from the elimination of open positions. Kohl’s also said in early January when it was still led by then CEO Tom Kingsbury that it was closing 27 store locations. The retailer has been under the leadership of interim CEO Michael Bender since May. Lululemon The yoga-inspired apparel brand said in June that 150 jobs would be cut at corporate headquarters as part of a change-up of its organizational structure. The eliminated positions were from Lululemon’s store support centers. A company spokesperson told Footwear News that the change-up was to allow the company to “operate with more agility and further invest in our growth.” Macy’s Inc. The department store retailer is closing a distribution center in South Windsor, Conn., starting on Dec. 28, 2025. A Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice indicated that 106 employees will be impacted by the closure. The warehouse is connected to Macy’s Backstage operation, according to the WARN notice. Backstage is Macy’s off-price banner. The closure is part of the retailer’s “Bold New Chapter” initiative, a three-year turnaround strategy started in 2024 aimed at leveraging synergies across its brands between warehousing, legal, finance and back-end operations that include its supply chain network. Nike Inc. The sportswear and footwear brand also known as Swoosh told employees in August that it planned to reduce its corporate staff by 1 percent. The move is a follow-up to the company’s disclosure when it posted fourth quarter results in June that would realigning its operations and review cost-cutting measures as it continued with its turnaround strategy. When Nike reported first quarter results on Sept. 30, it said that 8,000 employees were redirected to its “Sport Offense” initiative that aligns its three brands — Nike, Jordan and Converse — “into more nimble-focused teams by sport.” The brand also laid off some tech employees in May and June, moving some of that work to third-party vendors. It wasn’t immediately clear how many jobs were impacted by the shift. Nike cut over 1,600 jobs in 2024 as part of its $2 billion cost-savings plan. Puma SE The sportswear brand’s new CEO Arthur Hoeld said Thursday that the company would cut its “white collar” workforce by 900 jobs, bringing the total job cuts to 1,400 for the year. The reduction in staffing follows the 500 jobs cut in March. In total, Puma will have cut about 20 percent of its corporate workforce this year. Hoeld also said that Puma likely wouldn’t return to healthy growth until 2027. The disclosures were made as the company posted third quarter earnings results. QVC Group QVC Group, parent of the QVC and HSN home shopping TV networks, said in March that it would lay off 900 employees, or 5 percent of its global workforce, as part of a company reorganization. About 700 were from the HSN operation, following its move from a St. Petersburg campus in Florida to a Studio Park in West Chester, Penn., the home base for QVC. The home shopping network is shifting from primarily a cable TV model to a live social shopping platform. To that end, QVC Group is deepening its partnership with TikTok, a social and e-commerce platform that provides 24/7 shoppable livestream content. The company in February changed its name to QVC Group from Qurate. REI Co-op The retailer in January said it would cut 428 jobs, including 180 full-time roles and 248 part-time guides. The move is connected with the outdoor specialty retailer’s decision to shutter its 38-year-old adventure travel business Experiences. More layoffs are expected in 2026 when the outdoor retailer closes its Paramus, N.J. store in the first quarter, followed by its Boston, Mass., location and its high profile 40,000 square-foot SoHo, N.Y., door later in the year. Saks Global The parent of Saks Fifth Avenue in August said it was cutting 90 employees, bringing the total jobs cut this year to 1,236. Saks Global in April cut 446 positions when it shuttered a fulfillment center in La Vergne, Tenn., as well as 550 workers who held positions considered duplicate roles across both store and corporate functions in connection to its Neiman Marcus integration. Saks Global acquired Neiman Marcus in December 2024 in a $2.7 billion transaction. And in February, Saks Global cut about 150 from its corporate staff across finance, legal and operations. Target Corp. The mass discounter said in October that it was eliminating 1,800 corporate positions, which includes 800 open jobs that will go unfilled. Michael Fiddelke, Target’s incoming CEO — he takes on the role starting on Feb. 1, 2026 — and current chief operating officer said in a memo to employees that the retailer’s changes to its corporate structure was due to “too many layers and overlapping work” that has resulted in slowed decision-making. VF Corp. As part of the firm’s strategy to turnaround its business, an additional 400 more positions would be cut across the apparel and shoe giant’s global operations. The company said in January that cuts were forthcoming as part of its reorganization efforts, but didn’t disclose the total number of employees who would be impacted. Last November, VF said it would cut over 242 jobs due to the planned closure of its distribution in Martinsville, Va., with the shutdown to occur in March. Only $24.99 for one year!

Michael Fiddelke, Target’s incoming CEO — he takes on the role starting on Feb. 1, 2026 — and current chief operating officer said in a memo to employees that the retailer’s changes to its corporate structure was due to “too many layers and overlapping work” that has resulted in slowed decision-making. VF Corp. As part of the firm’s strategy to turnaround its business, an additional 400 more positions would be cut across the apparel and shoe giant’s global operations. The company said in January that cuts were forthcoming as part of its reorganization efforts, but didn’t disclose the total number of employees who would be impacted. Last November, VF said it would cut over 242 jobs due to the planned closure of its distribution in Martinsville, Va., with the shutdown to occur in March. Only $24.99 for one year!

Title: Rise of the AI Job-Killing Machines

Amazon, Paramount Skydance and others have made mass layoffs. Is artificial intelligence the culprit? By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America? Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.” A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Related Stories Amazon Web Services Outage: 'Significant Signs of Recovery' After Snapchat, Roblox and Other Major Websites Go Down Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI, saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative. He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%). Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago. In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.” In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.” Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees. A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg. AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap. The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report. Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps. But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.” “AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,”actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation. Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs. Just one example: Google, which didn’t exist three decades ago, employed 190,167 people as of the end of September. Some Hollywood leaders, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, have pushed the idea that AI is a net positive for creatives. “AI isn’t replacing storytellers — it’s creating tools that empower them to tell stories they never could before,” he said last month on an episode of the “Aspire With Emma Grede” podcast. In the same breath, however, Sarandos wondered whether making a “$300 million or $400 million movie” makes sense if the “monetization model” doesn’t justify the math. Generative AI tools, the exec said, “can do a very similar thing for a more controllable price.” You can forgive workers in the moviemaking trenches for hearing that as code for job cuts.

Title: America’s wealthiest billionaires got $698 billion richer this year, while the average home earned $83,000—and the gap’s set to get wider under Trump

Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies. While Americans are pinching their pennies amid SNAP cuts, soaring housing costs, and mass layoffs, the ultra-rich are seeing unprecedented wealth gains. In the coming years, we could even have our first trillionaire: Elon Musk. Now, a new report from Oxfam has revealed that the 10 richest U.S. billionaires added $698 billion to their net worths in the past year. Nearly the entire ultra-rich cohort is made up of tech leaders profiting from the gold rush in tech and AI, including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Dell founder Michael Dell. On average, each person on America’s top 10 rich list gained $69.8 billion over the past year—they made 833,631 times more than what the typical American household takes home. While Musk defends his eye-watering $1 trillion pay package, the average U.S. household only brought in $83,730 last year, according to U.S. Census data. While billionaires are getting richer, Americans are scraping by on their measly paychecks. Over 40% of the U.S. population—including nearly 50% of children—are considered to be poor or low income, according to the report. And looking at trends within the last few decades, the worsening wealth divide is even more stark. Between 1989 and 2022, a rich U.S. household at the 99th percentile (or top 1%) gained 101 times more wealth than the average home. In fact, the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans today own 12.6% of assets and 24% of the stock market. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of the U.S. owns just 1.1% of the exchange. Women and people of color have been hit hardest by mounting inequality; the average male-headed household gained four times as much wealth compared to the average female-led home. The fortunes of white households were bolstered 7.2 times more than the average Black household, and 6.7 times higher than the typical Hispanic/Latino home. And despite making up one-third of the U.S. population, Black and Hispanic/Latino households only hold 5.8% of the country’s wealth. What’s worse, America’s wealth gap is only expected to grow wider, the report warns, thanks to the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill, job scarcity, and an impending recession. History seems to be repeating itself; the wealthiest 0.0001% control a greater share of wealth than in the Gilded Age, according to the report. Billionaires have become king in America, and the new administration is passing legislation to safeguard their fortunes. “The Trump administration risks exponentially accelerating some of the worst trends of the past 45 years,” the Oxfam study notes, “having already overseen in less than one year a massively regressive tax reform, major cuts to the social safety net, and significant rollbacks for worker’s rights.” President Trump passed his One Big Beautiful Bill this July, which entails reducing the tax bill of the top 0.1% of earners in the country. By 2027, it’s expected that the statute will shave $311,000 off the tax costs of the ultra-rich, while the poorest Americans—making less than $15,000 annually—will be forced to pay even more in taxes. Among the 10 largest economies in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. is ranked second-to-last in using its tax and transfer system to fight inequality. In that cohort, America also has the highest rate of relative poverty. While America is home to more billionaires than any other country in the world, the average U.S. citizen isn’t getting a slice of the monumental economic success. Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandi, told Fortune last month that lower-income households are “hanging on by their fingertips financially.” Cost of living is raging, high-paying job opportunities are scarce, and layoffs are on the rise. To add fuel to the fire, America is descending into a recession; and 22 U.S. states are already seeing their economies contract, putting tight finances on the line. “The grip feels more tenuous because no one’s getting hired. You can sustain that for a while, but you can’t sustain that forever. If the layoffs do pick up, that lower-middle-income group is gonna get nailed—and they have no options,” Zandi said. “They have debt: They have auto debt, they have student loan debt, they may, if they’re lucky, have a mortgage, but they’re gonna struggle, and their world is going to descend into recession pretty quickly.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Goldman Sachs’ CEO debunks AI job replacement hysteria because he says humans will adapt like they always do: ‘Our economy is very nimble’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential and storied Wall Street firms, isn’t convinced an AI jobs apocalypse is on its way. In an interview with CNN, Solomon questioned the impact of the AI-linked layoffs that have recently caused widespread anxiety, from average job seekers to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While technological change may be moving faster than usual, we’ve seen this story before, the CEO said. “There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.” The most recent of these AI-linked layoffs arguably includes the 14,000 employees cut by Amazon last week. During the company’s quarterly earnings call that week, CEO Andy Jassy said the job cuts were “not even really AI-driven, not right now at least.” Still, Jassy earlier this year warned Amazon will not need as many employees in the future thanks to AI efficiency gains. Other AI-linked layoffs include those at Meta, which cut 600 jobs in its AI division, as well as Salesforce, which cut thousands of customer-service jobs in favor of AI agents. Finally, Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs earlier this year; CEO Satya Nadella said the company will add jobs in the future, but “with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI.” While many of these layoffs have grabbed headlines, a survey of Goldman Sachs investment bankers last week found only 11% of clients are actively cutting jobs because of AI. But the same survey found companies’ adoption of AI tools in their main business processes is heating up. The investment bankers found 37% of their clients, which span industries like real estate, tech, and finance, are using the technology for regular production. In the next year, the bankers expect more than half of their clients will follow suit, and in three years’ time, 74% of them will be incorporating AI into their businesses. Solomon, for his part, claims corporate AI implementation may mean fewer white-collar jobs, but said these positions will be picked up in other parts of the economy. Still, Solomon said the growing enthusiasm for AI could be a double-edged sword for the economy. While he has previously stopped short of calling the recent AI market exuberance a “bubble,” he warned that just like in previous waves of technological change, not everyone will come out winning. “The technology is exciting—there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon cancels what could have been the biggest Lord of the Rings video game ever
URL: https://winteriscoming.net/amazon-cancels-what-could-have-been-the-biggest-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-ever

Those awaiting the next big Lord of the Rings game are in for a disappointment, as Amazon has axed what promised to be a very exciting new adventure in Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings has given fans a plethora of fun video games over the years. Whether based on Peter Jacksonâs iconic trilogy or tied into the original books, a great Lord of the Rings game lets gamers enjoy the experience of Middle-earth in a variety of eras.Â One upcoming project that had fans excited was a reported Amazon Game Studios MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) that was untitled but set to expand on this world. This seemed the perfect concept as MMORPGs are a mainstay for fantasy fans such as Warcraft. So one based on the most iconic fantasy tale ever should be a hit, right? Sadly, it appears itâs not happening, as former Amazon Games engineer Ashleigh Amrine shared on social media that she was part of a huge round of layoffs at the company that also appears to have ended production on its upcoming Lord of the Rings video game. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she wrote. There wasn't much word on the details of the game other than it would allow players to span the events of both The Hobbit and the main Lord of the Rings trilogy. Itâs part of Amazon doing widespread layoffs, eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. Thatâs a blow to LOTR fans that adds to the complex history of this game.Â The winding road to a Lord of the Rings MMORPG rivals the quest to take the One Ring into Mordor.Â There had been a good entry made in 2007 with The Lord of the Rings Online, which is still running 17 years later and has been given numerous updates. But Amazon has been trying to move in on that space with an even more ambitious project, and it seems to be struggling to pull it off.Â Due to how complex a MMORPG can be to set up and maintain, creating one that brings the world of Tolkien to life is a challenge. In 2019, Amazon announced plans for a game by the Orange County team who would later craft the successful 2021 game New World and a partnership with Chinese company Leyou. In just two years, that title was canceled after Leyou was acquired by Tencent. In 2023, Amazon announced they were returning to the idea with the Embracer Group. In 2024, Amazon Games CEO Christoph Hartmann gave an update to fans.Â "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over. While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing that is different from all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.â Sadly, any plans are now undone by these massive layoffs. Itâs a blow to fans of the property and the games themselves. The last major Lord of the Rings game was 2023âs Gollum, which was slammed by both fans and reviewers as probably the worst LOTR game ever.Â The Lord of the Rings Online game is fun in how it allows players to craft a character of a certain class for adventures. Yet it has been showing its age in its updates and a brand new MMORPG utilizing today's advanced technology could have been a hit. Having gamers able to experience the events of the movies would have been the icing on the cake. Thereâs a chance the project could live on in some sort of form, yet the outcome doesnât look good. The gaming industry has been affected over the last few years by corporate attrition with numerous studios shuttered and countless games canceled. So for those hoping for another fantastic MMORPG set in Middle-earth, that quest seems to be over for now.Â
