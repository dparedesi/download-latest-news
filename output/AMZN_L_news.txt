ByWilliam P. Barrett, Senior Contributor. Earlier this year, Save the Children Federation, the nearly-century-old Fairfield, Conn.-based charity whose name describes its worldwide humanitarian focus, saw about half of last year’s nearly $500 million in annual U.S. Government funding evaporate. Meanwhile, New York-based International Rescue Committee (IRC), lost $400 million in U.S. funds. Originally formed to help refugees from Nazi Germany, the IRC had grown to serve the displaced around the world. “It’s a really tough time,” says Madlin Sadler, chief operating officer of the IRC, which has laid off a third of its 18,000 workers and pulled out of one country, Tanzania, with plans to leave four more due to federal funding cuts. In March, IRC ran a full-page ad in the Sunday New York Times (paid for by a private donor) beseeching other private givers to “meet the moment.” There’s no denying that’s it’s been a hard time for some of the nation’s top charities. Save the Children (STC) and IRC were sent reeling by the dramatic leveling of foreign humanitarian aid by the Trump Administration, with Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) wielding the ax. But domestic-focused charities have also had to scramble to adjust to less drastic cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and support for food banks at home. The full impact of the Trump cuts will be long debated, but early estimates are dramatic. This month the Gates Foundation estimated that 200,000 more children around the world under the age of five will die this year than last, the first rise in global infant mortality in decades. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates attributes much of this to the Trump Administration’s gutting of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. State Department unit that was the primary pump for an average of around $50 billion a year in foreign humanitarian aid. Much of this was routed through large U.S. nonprofits, which reported that income on their books as government support. Forbes’ 2025 list of America’s Top 100 Charities, released today, doesn’t directly reflect the extent of that damage, but it does show which charities were most at risk and may be deserving of your dollars now. That’s because our ranking, now in its 27th year, is designed foremost as a tool for individual donors and is based entirely on private contributions in each charity’s last reported fiscal year. In most cases, that year ended before President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. While the ranking is based on private giving, the report on each charity also details other key financial data, including government support, a metric that shows, for example, why International Rescue Committee and Save the Children were particularly vulnerable. IRC, ranked No. 37 on the new list, took in $529 million in private donations in its fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, which was dwarfed by the $967 million in direct government support it received. No. 43 Save the Children took in $470 million in private money, more than matched by $497 million from the government in its fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Other charities at risk from Trump’s international aid cuts: No. 15 World Vision, No. 34 Catholic Relief Services and No. 35 CARE USA. (You can view the full roster of 100 charities, and links to details about their finances here. Advice on how to use our list to analyze the finances of both the Top 100 and other smaller charities you’re considering donating to is here.) Private donations to the 100 entries on the 2025 Top Charities list rose 4.4%, beating the 2024 inflation rate of 2.9%. Collectively, they took in $66.5 billion, or 11% of the $592.5 billion given in 2024 to the country’s two million nonprofits, as measured by the Giving USA Foundation. Despite outliers like STC and IRC, government support on average came to only about one-quarter of private donations. Could private donors, spurred on by government cuts or a new tax break that kicks in next year allowing a modest charitable deduction for donors who take the standard deduction, make up for all the lost government funds? Probably not. But despite their oft-cited economic anxiety, ordinary folks are still giving. Benevity Inc., which provides a workplace donation platform to hundreds of companies, reported that donations it processed on Giving Tuesday earlier this month were up 7% from the year before. Meanwhile, a few of the richest Americans have stepped up in notable ways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency may be reeling from budget and staff cuts, but in October the private Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which both advises on responses and makes grants, announced the largest donation received in its history—$60 million from MacKenzie Scott, the break-the-mold philanthropist worth $33.6 billion, who is the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. As for Gates, in May he accelerated his timeline for donating 99% of his wealth—his Gates Foundation now plans to give away $200 billion over the next two decades as it works to prevent maternal and infant deaths and fight infectious diseases and poverty. The private Gates Foundation, like many charities involved with such missions, has historically tried to multiply its impact by working with government and other partners. That helps explain why some of the Top 100 Charities had become dependent on Uncle Sam’s money. Save the Children Federation, also known as Save the Children U.S., was founded in the U.S. in 1932, during the Great Depression, and modeled after a similarly named British nonprofit started after World War I. Initially, it focused on disadvantaged children in the Appalachian Mountains, and, with an emphasis on nutrition and education programs, still runs Head Start programs in rural areas across 14 U.S. states. But in recent years, three-fourths of STC’s efforts have been directed internationally, mainly through Save the Children International, a network of 30 affiliates providing relief in more than 100 countries. Difficult places Save the Children operates in includes the Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine. This year, due to reduced federal funding, the charity has pulled out of Malawi, Senegal, Brazil, Poland, Georgia and Liberia. Despite the fact that slightly more than half its funding (pre-Trump) came from the government, STC boasts some 337,000 “Mom and Pop” private donors who in 2024 contributed $87 million. Its highly visible fundraising efforts include use of such entertainment world endorsers as Jennifer Garner (who is also a trustee), Enrique Iglesias, Dakota Fanning and Olivia Wilde. “We have been accelerating our diversification of our funding and our work with the private sector,” says Clare Rodger, STC’s chief marketing and growth officer. This involves approaches like playing up specific programs and specific countries. Save The Children also has boosted its lobbying and advocacy efforts through its Save The Children Action Network, a social welfare organization with a 501(c)(4) tax status that allows political activity, including lobbying and even endorsing candidates. The IRC’s origins were life-saving but more ideological. Two predecessor groups (one blessed by Albert Einstein), were originally based in Hitler’s Germany and focused on getting political activists, intellectuals and Jews out of that country. The nonprofit later played a similar role during the 1956 uprising in Hungary against Communist rule and for much of its history was viewed by some as a stalking horse for the activist U.S. foreign policy establishment—indeed, one of its presidents, William J. Casey, later became director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Ronald Reagan. But IRC these days is more of a traditional aid agency, active in more than 40 countries. While retaining an emphasis on resettlement activities including into the U.S. (resettlements that Trump has halted), IRC has dived into war zones—Gaza, Sudan, Afghanistan and Ukraine, among others. Ciarán Donnelly, IRC’s senior vice president for international programs, says this year’s layoffs are due to U.S. government funding cuts. “It goes back to that challenge of making tough, ethical choices around what funding we have, and how do we deploy it,” he adds. IRC relies on large institutional private funders, but, like Save the Children, claims 300,000 private donors, most of them small and long-standing givers, and now needed more than ever. Vanguard Charitable, a donor-advised fund handling donations earmarked by individual donors of varying wealth, reported that $11 million went to IRC last year. Most top charities on our list are less dependent than these two on government funds. For the fourth straight year, No. 1 on our list is Feeding America, which rose to the top after the Covid 19 disruption of the economy and attention on food insecurity in the U.S. The Chicago-based umbrella for several hundred food banks around the country reported private contributions of $5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, up 1%. The bulk of that came in the form of private-sector food donations, but the charity still received nearly $300 million in cash donations. There are now eight food banks on the Top 100 Charities list. They, too, have had a trying year, with the Trump Administration cutting $500 million in emergency food aid earlier this year. (That’s before its temporary halt in SNAP food aid, a.k.a. food stamps, during the government shutdown.) No. 2 again was Good360. For the year ending December 31, 2024, the Alexandria, Va.-based clearinghouse that routes donated corporate gift-in-kind products to charities listed $3 billion in donations received, up 14%. When it comes to raising a lot of dollars from small donors, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, No. 3 on our list, remained the standout. From just a single location, the Memphis institution raised $2.8 billion in private donations in the year ending June 30, 2025, an 8% increase, while spending $431 million to do it. (You’ve seen the ads.) No. 4 was United Way Worldwide. The Alexandria, Va.-based network of more than 1,100 legally separate U.S. nonprofits emphasizing paycheck deductions had been the nation’s largest charity on our list for years until 2022, despite a steady decline due to the rise of specific-cause charities and alternative workplace giving platforms. For the year ending June 30, 2025, United Way received donations of $2.5 billion, down $10 million from the year earlier. The donation cutoff for this year’s roster—No. 100—rose 4% to a record-for-this-list: $204 million. That spot went to Wycliffe Bible Translators, of Orlando, Florida, dedicated to rendering Christianity’s holiest work into every language. Since this list is designed to inform would-be donors in the general public, we don’t look at colleges and other academic institutions soliciting specifically for themselves, on the theory their donations come primarily from their own alumni. We generally also avoid religious institutions, since they are not required to disclose financial information, and most don’t. (A notable exception is No. 6 Salvation Army, based in Alexandria, Virginia, which is technically a church as well as a major social services agency.) Read more here about our methodology for compiling the list and how this can help you evaluate any charity you consider supporting. As part of our due diligence for donors, we also report for each charity such metrics as overhead, fundraising costs, charitable commitment (how much goes to program support), and how much the top earning employee at each organization is paid. A record 31 of the 100 nonprofits on our list reported total compensation of more than $1 million for at least one employee (usually the CEO), up from 28 charities last year. As in past years, the highest paid were chief executives of large nonprofit hospital/medical operations. Peter L. Slavin, CEO of Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, was the top earner, at $8.8 million. He was followed by New York’s Mount Sinai Health Systems CEO Kenneth Davis, Cleveland Clinic Foundation CEO Thomas Mihaljevic and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center CEO Selwyn Vickers, who all earned around $7 million. International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, a former British foreign secretary, received $1.2 million. Save the Children CEO Janti Soeripto earned about half of that, at $650,000. There are eight newcomers or returnees-after-a-gap to the list. In alphabetical order: Atlanta Community Food Bank (96), Breakthrough T1D (94), Combined Jewish Philanthropies (83), Covenant House (99), Fellowship of Christian Athletes (86), Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation (42), United Service Organizations (92) and World Resources Institute (85). They replaced: Father Flanagan’s Boys’ Home, Hadassah the Women’s Zionist Organization of America, Metropolitan Opera Association, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Patient Access Network Foundation, Providence St. Joseph Health, Teach for America and United Negro College Fund. The UNCF might return to our list next year, thanks to a $70 million gift it received from MacKenzie Scott in September after the close of its latest complete fiscal year. The list of the Top 100 Charities is here. A fuller description of our methodologies and how donors can use the same metrics, along with other information, to help evaluate any charity is here.

Title: The year the Big Tech job market cracked

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Mody Khan lost his job at Microsoft last December, he was hopeful he'd bounce back quickly. But the tech job market had other ideas. Now, a year later, he's still looking. Despite a five-year run at Microsoft as a cloud solution architect, he said, even landing interviews has been a struggle. "I've been constantly applying, and I've had interviews, but I've been turned down everywhere," said Khan, who is in his 50s and lives in Texas. In the meantime, he's exhausted his rainy day fund and fallen behind on his mortgage payments. He's now worried he could lose his home. "I had savings, and I've depleted almost all of it," he said. "I'm in a very tight spot." Over the past year, I've spoken with more than 20 tech professionals for Business Insider stories who, like Khan, were struggling to find work. Many were affected by layoffs intended to right-size overhiring during the pandemic and streamline operations. US tech companies have announced roughly 154,000 layoffs through November, according to Challenger, a 17% increase from the prior year and the most of any private-sector industry. Big Tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees. While much of the broader labor market has been marked by slow hiring, it's been cushioned by low levels of firing — but not in tech. The job market has been particularly challenging for tech professionals, who are competing not only with a growing pool of laid-off workers but also with recent college graduates and employed tech professionals looking to switch roles. At the same time, the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and application bots has made it easier for candidates to submit hundreds of applications, overwhelming some employers and making it harder for top applicants to stand out from the crowd. This surge in demand for tech roles has coincided with a decline in the supply of available openings. After peaking in 2022 following a pandemic-era hiring spree, tech job postings on Indeed are down 33% from their levels in early 2020. The roles that remain are taking longer for companies to fill, and, amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US businesses are now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. To succeed in the 2025 tech job market, some candidates believe they need to be close to the perfect candidate. As Khan put it, "It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman." Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Read more on the topic: As the hiring slowdown drags on, some tech professionals are bracing for what might await them in today's job market. In October, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, a move CEO Andy Jassy said was intended to reshape the company's culture. Business Insider spoke with six affected employees about how they were coping with the news. Most began searching for new roles soon after they learned they'd been laid off, in part because they felt the tech job market could be very challenging. John Paul Martinez, formerly a technical support engineer at Amazon, said the prospect of competing with thousands of other laid-off tech workers — from Amazon and beyond — has left him anxious about the search ahead. "I am extremely fearful of the competition," said the 35-year-old, who lives in Orlando. Since 2022, Big Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla have collectively announced layoffs of more than 125,000 workers, according to data from the online tracker Layoffs.fyi. The roughly 34,000 layoffs from these companies so far this year — most of them tied to cuts at Amazon and Microsoft — mark a 65% increase over 2024. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for our newsletter. This influx of job seekers has helped fuel intense competition for roles across the economy. Last quarter, the average job opening received 242 applications — nearly triple the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. James Hwang, a former Amazon IT support engineer, said the hiring landscape has been just as tough as advertised. "The current job market has been crazy hard," said the 27-year-old, who lives in Michigan. "I've already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet." For many tech professionals, landing a Big Tech job is the ultimate goal. But in today's market, some have decided to broaden their horizons. After losing his contract role as an engineering program manager at Apple in September 2024, Lee Givens Jr. struggled to find work. Given his prior experience in Big Tech at Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, he initially focused his search on similar companies — but was unable to gain traction. That changed when he stopped limiting his search to Big Tech. In April, he landed a product manager role at a Toyota subsidiary. Givens said his total compensation is significantly higher than it was at Apple — and that he feels he's making more of an impact than he could at a larger tech corporation. After 17 years at Microsoft, Eduardo Noriega was laid off from his senior software engineering role in May. Instead of looking for another Big Tech job, he pivoted full-time to the staffing firm he'd spent nearly a decade building — a business he'd started partly as a cushion in case a layoff ever came. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." However, some workers are still finding ways to land roles at Big Tech companies. After 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Hendersen was laid off in May from her user researcher role. By October, she was working at Meta as a user experience researcher — a position she landed after receiving a referral from a connection. In June, shortly before graduation, Andrew Chen landed a software engineering role at Amazon. He said posting about his interview prep journey on TikTok helped keep him accountable — and opened the door to advice from others who'd been through the process. While some tech job seekers have managed to break through, many told Business Insider they're still searching for work — both in and outside Big Tech. For those still struggling, the challenge isn't just refining their job search strategy — it's also figuring out how to soften the financial blow of losing a paycheck. After being laid off from his technical program manager position at Microsoft, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he put his belongings in storage and moved to Florida to live with family, hoping to save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." Jump to

Your complete guide on all the latest news and details for the newly announced game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Along with a ton of exciting announcements from the 2025 Game Awards, Tomb Raider: Catalyst was just announced. That's right, folks, after waiting for around about seven years for a new Tomb Raider game, that isn't a remake or remaster, we are finally getting a fresh adventure for Lara Croft. Tomb Raider Catalyst is the second of two new games coming from Crystal Dynamics throughout 2026 and 2027. The first is a "reimagining" of our favorite adventure hunter's debut, with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. However, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is due to release shortly after, and will be the start of a new chapter in the series. As massive fans of all the best Tomb Raider games, we are very excited for Lara's comeback and have gathered all the information that you need to know ahead of the upcoming title's launch. Below you'll find details from the development team, breaking down story information, as well as details on the Tomb Raider: Catalyst release window, confirmed platforms, and more. So if you are ready to dive into what may just be one of the best adventure games on the near horizon, scroll on. Tomb Raider: Catalyst's release date will be heading our way sometime in 2027. This release window was revealed during the 2025 Game Awards, and also came with a snazzy teaser and news that we'd be getting Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis as well. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will be out first, though, as it's set to release in 2026. The game is a reimagining of Lara Croft's debut, so it'll be the perfect experience to pick up if you want to prepare for Lara's new adventure come 2027. We don't have a firm date yet for Tomb Raider: Catalyst. We expect to hear news soon, likely after Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis has been released. We'll keep you posted as more news heads our way, so keep your eyes on this page! Tomb Raider: Catalyst has been confirmed to be landing on PC (via Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S when it releases sometime in 2027. Currently, no Switch 2 releases have been announced; but worry not, Nintendo fans, there is still hope. The Switch 2 does support some games that were developed on Unreal Engine 5, just like Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Games such as Cronos: The New Dawn, Fortnite, and Split Fiction all run on the new hybrid console. So, there is always a chance that Tomb Raider: Catalyst could be added to our list of upcoming Switch 2 games in the future. Stay tuned for updates. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be following Lara Croft on a new adventure as she heads to North India after a mystical cataclysm has unleashed ancient secrets and forces that guard them. It's up to the badass treasure hunter to uncover the truth behind the event and also work to stop those who seek to use the mysterious power for their own benefit. The stakes are pretty high in the story, too, since it will be up to you to prevent a full-blown catastrophe that could very well shape the future. Exciting times! While we don't no many story-specific details, we do know the upcoming game is serving as a new chapter in the Tomb Raider franchise. Although it's technically set after the events of the Legend trilogy, you don't need to play those titles or the reboot trilogy either to get up to speed. This timeline information was confirmed to us by Will Kerslake, the Game Director of Crystal Dynamics, during a chat about the future title. "From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld, with the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we’re seeing a more experienced Lara Croft. But what’s important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he explained. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone." Like past Tomb Raider games, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is a single-player action-adventure game that will have you stepping into the shoes of Lara Croft. This is going to be a story-driven game, with Alix Wilton Regan (from Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect 3, and Cyberpunk 2077 fame) voicing Lara Croft. So expect to see some cinematic moments and get ready to buckle in for a more linear kind of adventure. In a press release for the game, it was also confirmed that players will get to explore the largest Tomb Raider map we've ever had. Along with exploration that is apparently increasing in scale, players can also look forward to diving into tombs that are packed with intricate puzzles to solve. So far, it sounds like everything you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game, just taken up a notch. However, we are still waiting on more gameplay reveals to show us more information on what kind of new mechanics and environmental puzzles will be on offer. Combat details and enemy encounters are also being kept under lock and key currently, so hopefully, we will get more news on those soon. While we wait for more details, you can check out our list of the best action games to play today to keep you busy. Crystal Dynamics has been developing Tomb Raider: Catalyst since 2022, back when its partnership with Amazon Game Studios was first announced. If you need a Tomb Raider refresher, Crystal Dynamics has been making games for the series since 2006's Tomb Raider: Legend. The studio is also known for the Legacy of Kain and Gex series, so in terms of action-adventure outings, the studio is as experienced as you can get. Tomb Raider Catalyst is being developed on Unreal Engine 5, and according to a press release following the upcoming game's official reveal at The Game Awards, Scot Amos, Head of Studio at Crystal Dynamics, has stated that the team is looking to push boundaries and innovate the series, thanks to Amazon Game Studios' support. "Our collaboration with Amazon Game Studios has been truly transformative for these ambitious projects," he writes. "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise. With Tomb Raider: Catalyst, we're crafting our most expansive and innovative Tomb Raider adventure yet." It should be noted that in 2025, Crystal Dynamics had three rounds of layoffs that affected various projects and departments in the studio. But it seems like Tomb Raider is safe from any potential cancellations for now, thanks to a reassuring LinkedIn post shared by the developer in November 2025. The post reads: "as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future." We'll keep you posted on any further news that comes our way, but things seem to be on course right now, which is a great sign.

Catalyst or Legacy of Atlantis? Choose your Lara If you're staying up all night to watch The Game Awards 2025, follow along with our live coverage. If you want an early night, you can catch up on all the news with our Everything Announced at The Game Awards 2025 roundup. The "future of Tomb Raider" has been dutifully revealed at this year's Geoff Awards, and it turns out the future is half-future, half-past. Amazon Game Studios and Crystal Dynamics have announced a pair of Tomb Raider games - Tomb Raider: Catalyst, the next major new instalment in Lara Croft's adventures, and the previously leaked Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, "a fully reimagined version" of Core Design's original Tomb Raider from 1996. Let’s start with Catalyst. It’s been in development at Crystal Dynamics since they partnered with Amazon Game Studios back in 2022, and is set in Northern India following “a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them”. Lara is racing various cackling badniks to claim yet another mighty treasure with the apparent power to reshape the geography underfoot. “As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future,” the press release declares. Here’s a video. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be the “largest Tomb Raider world yet”, with all the forgotten crypts and puzzles one might expect of a game featuring Indiana Jones’s sister from another mother. (Dear precious commenters, please find a way to make that rhyme - it’s 3am here and there is no poetry left in my bloodstream.) It’ll launch in 2027 for PC via Steam. Before that, though, you’ll be able to play Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which is being developed by Crystal and Shadow Warrior devs Flying Wild Hog. This also runs in Unreal Engine 5, and boasts of “new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game”. You’ll once again be hunting for the Scion, another momentous McGuffin that must be kept out of dastardly hands, and yes, the dinosaurs are still in it. Ah, my friend the T-Rex. It has been too long since you last chased me screaming around that cave. Look out for these and other hand-Crofted pseudo-vintage delights via Steam in 2026. Both the Catalyst and Legacy Of Atlantis incarnations of Croft are being voiced by Alix Wilton Regan - aka the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition, also known for roles in Mass Effect 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. It's been a very rough time for Crystal Dynamics this year, with three rounds of layoffs in swift succession. The last of those came in November, when the studio announced that "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" had been let go. Naturally, the press release for Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis paints a rosier picture, with Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos commenting that "Amazon’s partnership has provided the resources, expertise, and creative freedom necessary to realize our vision for both games without compromise." As for the remake, Wild Hog CEO Michał Szustak assures that "we’re expanding the universe while staying loyal to what fans have always loved." Time for another volcanic argument about tank controls, I guess. Games aside, Amazon are also working on a TV adaptation of Lara's adventures.

If you love the adventures of Lara Croft, boy howdy, you're in luck. Developer Crystal Dynamics made an appearance during the Game Awards 2025, revealing not just one but two Tomb Raider games. The first title, Tomb Raider: Catalyst, is Lara Croft's next big game. Slated to launch in 2027, the teaser trailer references Lara's struggles across the reboot trilogy, while showing her gearing up and fighting across more ancient ruins and lost civilizations. Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the press release touts that Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the series' "largest world yet," bringing more puzzles and mysteries for the intrepid explorer to solve. You can check out the teaser trailer for Tomb Raider: Catalyst below: Before that game arrives though, players will have the opportunity to revisit one of Lara's first outings...well, kinda. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996. Also developed with Unreal Engine 5 and with support from Flying Wild Hog, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is slated to launch in 2026. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, a deal that was struck all the way back in 2022, and both games will be launching across Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC (Steam), and PlayStation 5.It's been a minute since a new Tomb Raider game launched, with Eidos Montreal launching Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018 as the conclusion to the trilogy that began in 2013. Since then, Eidos Montreal and its sister studio Crystal Dynamics have changed hands, leaving Square Enix and being sold to Embracer Group. Unfortunately, in keeping with much of the rest of the gaming industry, Crystal Dynamics has also had multiple rounds of layoffs through 2022.

Title: Generation Z: US Faces Serious Economic Problems and Distrusts Politicians: Food Prices, Housing, Mass Layoffs.

The latest survey from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School shows that Americans aged 18 to 29 are deeply concerned about their future and skeptical that their leaders can solve the country’s growing problems, according to The Washington Post. This pessimism for the future also comes as the American youth are becoming increasingly radicalized, contributing to an uptick in left-wing political violence. Generation Z’s concerns are rooted in the difficult economic reality facing the US, according to the newspaper, which published the study’s data and conclusions on December 7. More than 40% of those surveyed reported financially “struggling” or “just getting by.” The high cost of housing, food prices, and a sluggish job market, marked by mass layoffs in various industries, are central themes in their daily conversations and lives. In this context, only a minority of the young people surveyed said the country is headed in the right direction, which, according to the poll, reflects the sense of instability felt by Generation Z in the US. The main message from this data is that the institutions and systems that should support them are not responding to their needs, generating widespread fear about what the future holds, the report adds. A key factor driving these economic fears is the pessimistic perception of Artificial Intelligence. The majority of young Americans see AI as a direct threat to their job prospects. A significant number even believe this technology will reduce their future employment opportunities. A Wall Street Journal report in October found that the US job market is becoming less welcoming due to a wave of layoffs primarily driven by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. Companies like Amazon, which plans to eliminate up to 10% of its corporate workforce, United Parcel Service (UPS), which has cut nearly 14,000 managerial positions, and Target, which laid off 1,800 employees, mainly due to increasing adoption of AI, are sending experienced and young workers into a stagnant labor market. In addition to technology, investors are pressuring executive management to operate more efficiently and with fewer staff, which, along with trade uncertainty caused by tariff policy and higher costs, is contributing to the slowdown in hiring. The result is a precarious outlook for youth and regular workers, with fewer opportunities for well-paying jobs that support families and fund retirements. The Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School’s survey also underscores a marked distrust of institutions of power. Generation Z distrusts the federal government and Congress, as well as the two major political parties. When asked to summarize the parties in one word, the most common term used to describe Democrats was “weak,” while for Republicans it was “corrupt.” This negative view is indicative of a deep disenchantment with the ruling class. Approval ratings for the current Republican administration and lawmakers from both parties remained below 30%. A majority also disapproved of the Trump administration’s handling of the economy and the US healthcare system, which is characterized by its high fees. In a Fox News poll, the majority of voters said Trump’s economy had hurt them, and three-quarters of Americans said their grocery costs had gone up in the past year, according to polling from Marquette University Law School. Just 26% said Trump was doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Amid the economic problems, favorable views of Trump’s job performance have dropped by 14 percentage points, according to The New York Times’ polling average. Responding to the New York Times’ polling, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the administration was working to “deliver economic relief for the American people, from signing historic drug pricing deals to securing working-class tax cuts.” “More work remains,” he added, “but Americans can rest assured that the same policies that created a historic economy in President Trump’s first term are set to repeat the success in his second term.” Disillusionment extends to the economic system as well. According to the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School survey, support for capitalism has declined, reversing a rebound seen in 2020, and although most said they reject political violence, which has dominated the country’s news since the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, almost 40% of those surveyed consider it “acceptable under certain circumstances,” reflecting a growing radicalization among citizens in the face of political polarization. Although left-wing political violence and incidents averaged 0.6 annually from 1994 to 2000 and doubled to 1.3 over the following decade, numbers began to grow substantially in 2016, at the height of the culture wars and when Trump was first elected. From 2016 to 2024, they averaged 4.0 a year, while this year is set to break records, demonstrating how increasingly radicalized American youth are amid serious economic problems and distrust in politicians. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Weekly unemployment benefit applications rise to 236,000 as labor market concerns persist

Your monthly donation keeps PBS News strong Matt Ott, Associated Press Matt Ott, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remain in the same historically healthy range of the past few years despite growing concern over the health of the labor market. U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 to 236,000 from the previous week’s 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 213,000 new applications. READ MORE: The economy is giving mixed signals. Here’s what experts say they mean The previous week’s figure, analysts say, was distorted by the Thanksgiving holiday. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Despite what on the surface appears to be a historically healthy job market, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. While government data shows that the economy has added a sluggish 40,000 jobs a month since April, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000. That would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of 20,000 jobs a month since the spring. “It’s a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,” Powell told reporters. “People care about that. That’s their jobs.” Jobless claims figures in recent years have remained in a historically healthy range, suggesting that overall layoffs have been muted despite some high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low. Last week, private payroll data firm ADP estimated U.S. job losses of 32,000 in November. The surprisingly weak report comports with recent government employment data, which has shown a significant decline in job growth since President Donald Trump implemented his sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April. Though September had a solid gain of 119,000 jobs, June and August both showed net job losses. The unemployment rate has inched up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years. November’s comprehensive jobs data has been delayed for release until next week due to the government shutdown. Job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not be reflected in Thursday’s data. WATCH: 3 things to know about AI and mass corporate layoffs The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That’s the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April, but some analysts said the plunge is due to a variety of factors, including seasonal adjustments and the fact that most people aren’t eligible for benefits after 26 weeks. The Labor Department’s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,000 to 216,750.

Reports suggests "a dozen" employees have been made redundant from Guildford-based studio Around "a dozen" employees at Glowmade are reportedly facing layoffs. That's according to Insider Gaming, which has seen documentation suggesting that the launch of the studio's title King of Meat "failed to meet internal expectations by a significant margin." Sources claim leadership at the Guildford-based developer expected "a concurrent player count of at least 100,000" for the game on Steam, but it "failed to hit 1,000 consistently across all platforms" with a concurrent player peak of 320 on SteamDB. As a result, the studio reportedly "began discussions with staff about voluntary redundancies earlier this month, affecting around a dozen people." GamesIndustry.biz has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment. Glowmade was founded in 2015 by three developers from Lionhead Studios. In 2021, the independent studio partnered with Amazon Game Studios as part of its expansion into third-party publishing. Amazon Games would go on to publish King of Meat, which launched in October 2025. Last August GamesIndustry.biz spoke to Amazon's EMEA publishing director Jon Rosenblatt about its games strategy, and how King of Meat fit within its plans. "It's really important for us to continue to build amazing games, but also make sure that the games are diverse in their look and their feel," said Rosenblatt. "King of Meat was just an ideal opportunity for us to work with a very talented team in Guildford, and really grow that game out into something much bigger than maybe they have planned."

But the spectre of AI is looming for 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. For the world of video games, 2025 was more about what didn’t happen than what did. It was supposed to be the year in which the blockbuster of all blockbusters, Grand Theft Auto VI, arrived to sweep all before it, but GTA VI has now been definitively (so Rockstar Games assures us) delayed until 19th November, 2026. In light of that, 2025 will go down as a decent if unspectacular year for video game design – but some interesting trends and talking points emerged over the last twelve months, many of which may get overlooked at tonight's The Game Awards. Indie game developers and AA releases found favour ahead of costly blockbusters, retro gaming and the nostalgia hit of remakes won over new and old fans alike, VR threatened to go big, then didn't, and AI seeped into every aspect of game development, and it's not leaving. So-called AA games – with significantly smaller budgets than the AAAs churned out by the big publishers – conspicuously received the majority of the plaudits from those with an interest in games design in 2025. Especially Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, from French developer Sandfall Games and publisher Kepler Interactive, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, made by tiny Australian indie Team Cherry. Honourable mentions are also due for Rebellion’s Atomfall and Supergiant Games’ Hades II. All those games boasted strong, distinctive art direction and the sort of personality and quirkiness that the big publishers seemed unable to deliver. Next year will mark ten years since the current wave of VR was first hyped as the next big thing in game design, not to mention the future of our everyday lives. But just as the much-touted metaverse has failed to take off, that vaunted, hardware-shifting killer VR game has also stubbornly failed to appear. We had some good VR games in 2025, such as Alien: Rogue Incursion, that brought the industrial-futurism of the films to life, while Midnight Walk's hand-made claymation style felt original and demanded attention. So, while there are some fun and innovative VR games out there, there’s also a sense that unless VR headsets become drastically less uncomfortable and restrictive, and more affordable, VR will never achieve the mainstream heights once ascribed to it. And after a decade, is its crunch time approaching? Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. The games industry’s biggest money-makers are its annual franchises, churned out regularly by the mega-publishers. But are they finally starting to show signs of flagging? EA Sports’ FC 26 arrived with something of a mea culpa – a raft of changes touted as a response to fan criticism of FC 25. Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will probably snatch the coveted Christmas number one sales spot, but received a lukewarm welcome, with its (admittedly praised) Warzone element under pressure from an unheralded newcomer, ARC Raiders. And it was a disastrous year for perennial so-called live service games, with Sony cancelling Concord mere weeks after a disastrous launch, along with seven other live-service games purportedly under development. In both video games and the wider world, 2025 was indisputably the year of AI. And in the games world, familiar fears of AI replacing the likes of voice-artists, character artists and dialogue writers were voiced – perhaps fallaciously, since videogames have embraced AI since the mid-1990s. AI has already been used to ease and speed up game development, via techniques like procedural generation, and generative AI was used by the likes of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and ARC Raiders. But gamers are vigilantly looking out for so-called AI slop – which some less-scrutinised mobile games have been criticised for – and will cry foul if that creeps into console and PC games. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 couldn't escape accusations of AI use, while on the flipside, Ubisoft revealed its new game, Teammates, is built around the use of gen AI. Likewise, EA and Krafton have invested heavily in gen AI workflows. AI in video games doesn't look like stalling, but it leaves room for non-AI, human-made games to succeed in a heavily vigilant market. 2025 was a great year for remakes and remasters of old games – classics like the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games, Resident Evils 2 and 4, Broken Sword, the Dragon Quest games and The Elder Scrolls Oblivion received the modern-tech remake treatment, and the final instalment of Square Enix’s brilliant reimagining of Final Fantasy VII will arrive in 2026. Even Clair Obscur had retro-style turn-based gameplay, and solo-developer games (inevitably with retro-adjacent graphics) like Citizen Sleeper 2 and Quantum Witch created a stir. Redesigned hardware from Evercade and the brilliant Sinclair GamerCard helped make retro gaming more accessible, and the year is ending how it began, with the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate proving one of 2025's most hyped games. In 2025, gamers felt the most creative games came from indie, rather than major publishers. All the AA-games covered above were published by indies, and the likes of horror games Look Outside and No, I’m Not A Human, plus Ball x Pit and Blue Prince, were showered with praise for innovating. The list really is a good one for 2025: Skate Story, The Drifter, Rematch, Lushfoil Photography Sim, as well as the upcoming Will: Follow the Light. The best games from majors – Avowed, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Battlefield 6, Split Fiction, Death Stranding 2, Borderlands 4 and Assassin’s Creed Shadows – overwhelmingly had a whiff of “seen it all before” to them. And when Electronic Arts became the subject of a leveraged private equity buyout, it had to counter accusations that it would lose interest in its non-annual franchises like Mass Effect. The successful arrival of the Switch 2 demonstrated that Nintendo, while a major pillar of the games industry, still operates in its own unique way. The Switch 2 remains pricey and conceptually near-identical to its predecessor. However, I suspect that next year will see it really come into its own, when first-party titles are added to supplement Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the recently released Metroid Prime 4, and crucially, it finally allows Nintendo-heads to play cross-platform blockbusters that were previously the sole province of Sony or Microsoft consoles. The rash of games industry layoffs that started in 2022 tailed off somewhat in 2025 but, to the dismay of all, by no means ended. Studios owned by the likes of Ubisoft, Amazon Games, 2K Games, Funcom and Square Enix were either shuttered or had their workforces slashed, albeit with most layoffs occurring in the US. Over-capacity after the world took to gaming during the Covid lockdown and overestimation of the appeal of live-service games caused that particular trend, but the industry hopes it’s finally approaching its endgame.

Title: King of Meat studio was reportedly expecting 100,000 concurrent players, but it peaked at 320 on Steam—and that was during a free weekend

Glowmade is now reportedly making layoffs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. An Insider Gaming report says Glowmade Games will lay off employees in January 2026 after its debut game, the Amazon-published King of Meat, flopped badly. While the number of employees being put out of work isn't known, sources told the site that the process began earlier this month with discussions about voluntary redundancies that would impact about a dozen people. Word of the layoffs, confirmed by multiple Glowmade employees on LinkedIn, comes just a couple months after the release of King of Meat, a "co-op party platformer" for up to four players. It's yet another ugly outcome for a game studio, but what makes this case particularly interesting is that the report claims "leadership"—whether that's at Glowmade or Amazon isn't specified—was expecting a concurrent player count for King of Meat of at least 100,000. The actual number? On Steam, it peaked at just 320, according to SteamDB, a number it only managed to achieve thanks to a free weekend. The player count quickly tailed off after that to double-digits, and at this moment sits at just 12, enough to populate three matches. That doesn't tell the full story, since King of Meat is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. But even if each of those platforms had 100 times as many players as Steam, which seems extremely unlikely, King of Meat would still only be 1/50th (figures approximate, I am bad at math) of the way toward the minimum number of players anticipated by management. That's not just a big flop, it also speaks very poorly of the judgment of the high-ups who thought this game would be a hit on that scale. We can't say for certain whether that reported figure is accurate, but we can say that a lot of money and effort was poured into marketing King of Meat, including an announcement trailer at the Geoff Keighley-hosted Opening Night Live show at Gamescom 2024—that couldn't have been cheap—and an entire Mr. Beast special, complete with $250,000 prize. Optimism is great—you won't get far in the videogame business without it—but the expectations placed on King of Meat were wildly out of place. And that's not just hindsight speaking: Turn the page back to that ONL reveal in August 2024, when PC Gamer senior editor Wes Fenlon said King of Meat "seems doomed to be a casualty of the live service era before it's even out." What comes next for King of Meat isn't clear, but probably nothing good. Amazon made major cuts to its gaming business as part of a massive wave of layoffs in October, which also saw it pull the plug on New World, a not-terribly-old MMO that was still attracting a decent audience. If New World can't make it on Amazon's watch, I don't imagine King of Meat has much hope for a bright future either.

Title: What does the Netflix deal mean for Warner Bros's games division?
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-does-the-netflix-deal-mean-for-warner-bross-games-division
Time Published: 2025-12-10T16:43:04Z

Industry experts on the future for studios like Avalanche, Netherrealm, and Rocksteady After a brutal 12 months marked by financial underperformance, studio closures, and reorganisation, a fresh shadow has fallen over Warner Bros. Games: the prospect of a new corporate owner. The division is included – as an afterthought – in the sale of Warner Bros. Discovery to Netflix, which was subsequently challenged by a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance. Both potential buyers are wooing shareholders, and whoever wins will require regulatory approval, so closure on the deal is months or years away. Whatever the outcome, there is widespread concern about the impact on Warner's games teams. The firm is the only major Hollywood mega-studio to have maintained a strong position in gaming. It owns a series of successful mobile games as well as the AAA studios Netherrealm, Avalanche, Rocksteady, and TT Games alongside support studios in the US and Canada. Warner's hits have included TT's Lego games, Rocksteady's Batman Arkham series, and the runaway success of Avalanche's Hogwarts Legacy, which has sold over 30 million units. Netflix, meanwhile, has yet to make a significant impact in games, despite years of trying. After a splashy but ultimately fruitless investment in AAA, and deciding against bidding for EA (as reported by Bloomberg), the company has refocused on casual, second-screen games, supported by licensing titles like GTA. Games head Alain Tascan, an industry veteran with long stints at Epic and Ubisoft, has committed to titles that "use the phone as a controller," with a focus on multiplayer, kids, narrative, and mass appeal, as well as an eye on the social layer that Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft deliver. The company has cancelled unannounced publishing deals with external studios, sources have told GamesIndustry.biz. In public, it shut down the developer of its successful Squid Game mobile title and sold internal team Spry Fox back to its founders. The company is also planning to borrow $59 billion to pay for Warner, one of the largest such loans yet granted, and will be looking at asset sales to bring that figure down post-completion. On the face of it, the prospects for Warner's game division under Paramount look brighter. Newly added subsidiary Skydance has published a series of VR titles under the leadership of David Ellison, who now leads Paramount Skydance, and the company has a long history of licensing its IP for games, from Nickelodeon through to South Park and Star Trek. And it says it wants to do more. "During the merger with Skydance, Paramount identified games as a potential area of development and growth for the company," points out Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis. "David Ellison has greenlit, maintained and shipped Triple A scale multiple games at Skydance," says Symbol Zero's Rafael Brown. "Netflix hasn't greenlit and maintained, and shipped, a game budget of more than $5 million for any project thus far. The closest would have been Team Blue's Triple A game, which was cancelled. Netflix has zero history in funding and supporting Triple A games successfully." The optimistic view is that Netflix will reconsider this approach post-acquisition. Blue Moons' Richard Browne, who served as VP of Universal's game group before executive roles at THQ and Digital Extremes, is bullish. "I don't think they cease publishing AAA games," he says. "With Warner Bros. recently restructuring to support the core business, much as we did at Universal back in the early 2000s, it's now better positioned to deliver transmedia in a more coherent way. Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games, Alain Tascan will be able to harness and direct it accordingly." "Assuming the division delivers positive growth and profit, there would be very little reason for Netflix to integrate it into an incompatible service or shutter it. You have a AAA industry veteran running Netflix Games." "WB Games is a collection of some of the top game studios in the world," says Cassia Curran of the Curran Games Agency, "and they specialise in taking existing IP and translating them into fantastic, high quality games. Netflix could pump up the value of their premium subscription tier by allowing access to these games, and greatly deepen fan engagement and the value of the IP they own outright, such as KPop Demon Hunters, with top-tier AAA games made by the studios at WB Games." "This is a big opportunity for Netflix to recalibrate and double down on games," agrees Hendrik Lesser, president of the European Games Developer Federation. "The mix of great studios, great IP and Netflix's reach is one of a kind." Others go further. Far from being an afterthought, game studios should be a key plank in Netflix's ongoing growth, argues Lirui Ding of the games venture capital firm Transcend Fund. "What they're acquiring isn't just IP, but a studio system that's already proven it can translate world-class franchises into hit games," he says. "That matters because in gaming and entertainment more broadly, content is where durable value accrues. We have definitely seen this in the Transcend portfolio. Technology, tools, and platforms evolve, but gaming hits extend IP lifecycles, deepen engagement, and compound value across media. If handled correctly, games can reinforce the entire franchise ecosystem." The pessimistic view is that this heralds another round of industry downsizing from a company that has bought a business it doesn't need. "I believe Netflix will initially leave studios alone for the first six to 12 months and then start making cuts," says Brown, "and then gradually dismantle all of WB Games due to not wanting the financial outlay of AAA games that they did not purchase WB for." Many see Paramount as a less disruptive prospect. "Skydance is likely to value these game studios much more highly," says Curran. "It's had significant success with VR games like The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, and WB Games studios make similar games to their Amy Hennig-led Skydance New Media team, which is releasing Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra next year, so they would fold in with each other easily. A Skydance acquisition would probably end up being business as usual for the WB Games studios." Harding-Rolls agrees. "I think the WB Games status quo is more likely to come from a Paramount acquisition rather than Netflix," he says. "I would expect Netflix to make more changes including potentially scaling down the number of studios." Any such divestment would require willing buyers, which have been thin on the ground in recent years. "Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Embracer, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Tencent, Netease, Krafton, and Nexon are all not in the space for buying right now," says Brown. "The game industry is retrenching and everyone is shedding studios and projects." Others are more optimistic. "I think there would be some buyers for select studios," says Harding-Rolls, "but the deal appetite for AAA studios remains quite soft due to the investment needed and the risks involved. The obvious candidates would be Savvy Games, EA (via the Saudi Public Investment Fund), and the console companies." Investors see value, too. "I think you'd actually find a healthy buyer universe for WB's marquee assets such as NetherRealm and Avalanche Software," says Joe Yuan, Investment Director at Hiro Capital. "The Korean strategics including Krafton, Nexon, and Smilegate are quite active in today's market, and private equity has emerged as a new buyer category and are looking for established, scaled assets that they can use as an anchor to pull in other acquisitions." Yuan can also see an outcome where the studios could go solo. "We are seeing more and more management buyouts emerge, so I think that may be a viable path for some of these teams to control their destiny a bit more and have more financial upside," he says. Arc Games, Saber Interactive, and Toys for Bob have found the support to break away, and it's possible WB studios could too, although investors would need deep pockets. The prospects are brightest for Avalanche, with the record-breaking success of Hogwarts Legacy behind it, and Netherrealm, buoyed by the consistent performance of Mortal Kombat. Rocksteady, weighed down by the expensive underperformance of Suicide Squad, has a much gloomier outlook. Nevertheless, "studios with the proven ability to profitably ship AAA titles are valuable assets," says Transcend's Ding. "Strategic buyers, major publishers, platform holders, and private equity seeking revenue quality would all likely take a look in a strategic carve-out scenario." A notable new buyer in the event of Netflix prevailing might be… Paramount. Picking up WB's gaming studios could soften the blow of missing out on the film studio assets – although integrating them would be a significant undertaking and would inevitably involve layoffs. "I expect there to be some streamlining whichever company ends up acquiring," says Harding-Rolls. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity. They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." Brown's outlook remains the bleakest. "Netflix is a train wreck for games and interactivity," he says. "They have been consistently for a decade now. This is not by choice but because everything is geared towards video subscription retention." "Paramount is hungry to grow a games division, but they can do that without Warner Bros. Meanwhile, Netflix wants video content but not video games. The game and movie industries are both healthier if neither Paramount nor Netflix buys Warner Bros Digital." Lirui Ding and Shanti Bergel at Transcend Fund see a brighter future, in line with the rise of transmedia success stories, from Fortnite to the Sonic movie series, that bridge games and other forms of entertainment. "The biggest opportunity is to demonstrate that games are a first-class content pillar, not a side initiative. If Netflix leans into this third chapter and lets the studios operate with the autonomy required to succeed, it could meaningfully redefine cross-media franchise building. If not, others will capture that value by acquiring the talent and capabilities that emerge. Either way, the long-term winners will be those who understand that content – not tooling or distribution alone – commands the highest value."

Title: Wins, setbacks, and rivalries: Inside Cindy Rose's first 100 days as CEO of ad giant WPP

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Cindy Rose took the helm at the advertising agency giant WPP in September, she inherited one of the most challenging jobs on Madison Avenue. Battered by a period of big account losses, internal restructuring, and thousands of layoffs, morale had sunk. So had the share price. London-based WPP was trading at lows not seen since 2009, and the company had warned investors that the remainder of the year would continue to be rocky. Insiders and shareholders were hopeful that Rose, a US-born executive most recently at Microsoft, could serve as a kind of Goldilocks porridge compared to her predecessors. She was widely seen as a happy medium between Martin Sorrell, the outspoken British business mogul who had built WPP from the ground up over 33 years, and Mark Read, the more introverted operator who took over in 2018. Rose was described by one analyst as a "peacemaker," and her tech background and experience in maintaining client relationships were viewed as positive attributes that would help bring about much-needed change. This week, Rose marked her 100th day in the role. Darren Woolley, CEO of the management consultancy Trinity P3, scored Rose a "7.8 out of 10" for her performance so far. "She's saying all the right things and has sent some signals to the market. The big test will be what happens early next year, as she sets out her strategy," Woolley said. "Cindy will not last a year if they don't believe the strategy can be delivered." Rose's wins during her first 100 days — some major new business, key hires, a big partnership with Google, and an oversubscribed bond sale — have been dampened by bad news. On her first earnings call, in October, Rose described the company's performance as "unacceptable." Shortly after delivering its second profit warning of the year and downgrading its full-year growth forecast, its shares spiraled further downward, and WPP was demoted from the FTSE 100 index of the UK's largest publicly listed companies. Shares of the London-listed company have dropped by about 18% since Rose became chief executive. Adding to Rose's overflowing in-tray, WPP was hit with a lawsuit from one of its former executives who said he was fired in July of this year — before Rose's arrival as CEO — after he raised concerns internally that the group's media investment division was allegedly running a kickback scheme. WPP said in November it would "vigorously" defend itself against the allegations made in the suit. The case is ongoing. WPP has fallen behind the sector's star performer, Publicis Groupe, and it faces a new titan following the combo of Omnicom and IPG this year. Agencyland also faces a bigger, existential quandary: What is the role of a large advertising agency holding company amid the rise of tech and the emergence of AI solutions that claim to automate much of the work agencies charge top dollar for? This account of Rose's tenure so far draws on interviews with more than a dozen current and former WPP staffers and clients, competitors, marketing consultants, and industry analysts. They said Rose deserves credit for delivering a positive narrative about WPP's opportunities while also owning its problems. Much of her fate will rest on a strategy plan that she has said she will outline fully next year. Insiders and analysts said her strategy will need to be bold and visionary, given the challenges ahead. Rose told Business Insider in a statement that in her first 100 days, she has actively sought feedback from WPP's top clients to help create a blueprint for what the company needs to do differently in the future. "I'm most proud of our WPP employees for their incredible resilience, client obsession, and passion to win, which is already making a difference, and you can see it in the business that we're winning: Mastercard, Reckitt, Henkel, and more to come," Rose said. This past September, from the company's 3 World Trade Center campus in New York City, Rose laid out a three-pronged blueprint for what she called "a new WPP" at her first global town hall as CEO. Her first priority was "putting people first" by creating an environment for employees to thrive. She said WPP should be famous for "being completely client-obsessed" as part of her "winning for clients" principle. And she said WPP should be "harnessing our AI advantage," telling staffers to become "AI superusers." Her opening address to employees was received well internally, insiders said. "We were pleasantly surprised," one current senior WPP agency staffer said. They added that Rose is "so much better at the human stuff" than her predecessors and said she had kept the company regularly updated with videos talking up the agency's wins. WPP has been heavily pitching WPP Open, an internal AI-powered platform that integrates with technology from companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Salesforce. It connects signals from clients' own first-party data, partners, and WPP's data on the performance of thousands of campaigns to help plan and place ads, and measure the results. In October, with Rose firmly in situ, WPP announced WPP Open Pro, a self-service version to give clients their own access to the platform. The aim was to grow WPP's client base by appealing to smaller advertisers or direct-to-consumer companies that tend to handle much of their marketing in-house. WPP told staffers internally that more than 400 brands had proactively contacted the company about Open Pro in the three weeks after it launched. Douglas Hayward and Gerry Murray, analysts at the research company IDC, described the Open Pro launch in a report as "a smart move that shows that WPP is prepared to be bold and innovative and even to cannibalize its revenue in the short term." However, some analysts questioned whether WPP would be able to invest enough in marketing Open Pro to appeal to this sort of audience, which is accustomed to using tools provided by tech giants like Meta and Google. Nearly all of WPP's rivals are also leaning heavily into their tech investments and offerings as part of their pitches to clients and investors. One former WPP agency executive, who left last year, said they felt Rose should be more proactive in emphasizing the company's creative prowess as something that sets it apart from other agency holding groups and the broader tech sector. "Creativity is the only thing that human beings have got to make a difference," the exec said. Agency relationships with tech platforms are an important part of the mix as they try to differentiate themselves from competitors. This fall, in Mountain View, Rose signed a key deal with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, which sent a signal out to the market, clients, and its rivals about the strength of WPP's relationship with Google. The "expanded five-year partnership" was billed as going far beyond typical agency-Google setups. WPP said it would commit to spending $400 million on Google's tech as part of the partnership, which will give it "preferred" access to Google's latest AI models and data. Google is also one of WPP's biggest clients. Save for her welcome address to staffers, which was posted on YouTube, and her first earnings call, Rose has kept a fairly low public profile. In November, she appeared at an AI conference in New York City, hosted by Microsoft and Luma Partners, an investment bank. Attendees — who included roughly 100 high-profile tech, advertising, and media executives — said she was whisked away by her handlers into the green room before her talk, a session with Google Americas President Sean Downey, and made a swift exit afterward. Three attendees said they felt Rose missed an opportunity. "Martin, in the old days, would have worked the room for one hour," one person said, referring to Sorrell, the former WPP CEO. At the moment, WPP is a company that "needs more visible leadership for the market, for the staff, for the shareholders, for the clients," Trinity P3's Woolley said. Rose enters an advertising agency landscape that has fundamentally changed. For years, WPP was the top dog. WPP under Sorrell built a formidable empire, acquiring creative agencies and PR shops around the world, and building GroupM (now known as WPP Media) into a huge force, responsible for planning and buying billions of dollars in media across TV, print, out-of-home, and digital. The market dynamics shifted, largely due to the emergence of tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, which offer self-service tools that let advertisers bypass agencies. AI has only sped up the disruption. In recent years, clients have pressured agencies to produce more work at lower costs. Agencies have had to respond by retooling to offer marketers more services than just producing and placing ads. Rival ad firm Publicis recognized these shifts early. It made first-party data and technology services its citadels and simplified its pitch around a "power of one" operating strategy. In 2024, the French company became the biggest holding company by revenue, and over the past 18 months has won a string of clients — including many from WPP. Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun is described by many in the industry as a charismatic and omnipresent force of nature with clients, and a fierce competitor to Rose as she seeks to retain major accounts and acquire new ones. During the pitch process this year for Mars' $1.7 billion media business — before Rose was in-post as WPP CEO — the confectionery giant summoned all the agencies involved to meet on a cold January morning at the M&M's Store in central London. Sadoun turned up about an hour earlier than the scheduled time. The Mars clients hadn't arrived yet, and the doors to the store were locked shut. He waited outside on Leicester Square. Once Mars' marketing team arrived, Sadoun greeted them, and they duly invited him in for coffee — much to the chagrin of the competing agencies, who weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity to get extra face time with the clients. Mars this summer moved its media account from WPP to Publicis. "There are two types of people in life: The ones who are five minutes early and the ones who are five minutes late. It's a personal choice, and Arthur has decided to use these rules for unfair advantage by arriving 10 minutes early," said Richard Robinson, executive director of Ingenuity+, an agency search consultancy that wasn't involved in the Mars pitch. Three marketing consultants involved in client pitches said Rose is also visible and warm with clients, delivering passionate addresses and asking personal questions. They say Sadoun takes it to the next level. Focus now turns to 2026 after WPP's annus horribilis. WPP has appointed the management consulting firm McKinsey to assist Rose in conducting a strategic review of the business. Rose said in October that she would detail the outcome in the new year. Insiders and analysts predict further layoffs amid a shrinking agency landscape. Jay Pattisall, principal analyst and VP at the research company, forecasts a 15% reduction in agency jobs across the industry as automation and AI force agencies to "pivot from selling services to selling solutions." The open question is whether WPP can be optimized to success, or whether it will have to sell some or all of its business in order to best position itself for the future. Or could WPP even pull an Omnicom and acquire a rival? Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said WPP had multiple conversations about a potential acquisition of the US-centric media buying company Horizon over the years, but that the talks never came close to a deal. A Horizon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on speculation. "They need to do some kind of jujitsu," a second former WPP executive said, referring to an unexpected M&A move to outmaneuver rivals. As insiders await the outcome of the review, WPP is expected to soon start feeling the impact of some recent sizable new business wins. It secured more than $1.5 billion in billings in November alone, including the consumer goods company Reckitt appointing WPP as its media agency of record and Henkel awarding WPP the media duties for its European consumer brands. WPP was further buoyed this week after its Wavemaker media agency secured a four-year contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to produce the UK government's ad campaigns — an account previously held by Omnicom. Rose has also made some key leadership appointments and formed a new executive management team that could help rally the troops and boost momentum. In one notable hire — and a poke in the eye to rival Sadoun — she persuaded Laurent Ezekiel, who was formerly WPP's CMO, to reverse a planned move to Publicis and become CEO of the WPP agency Ogilvy instead. Some investors appear optimistic that Rose can steer the company back on course. This month, investors ordered nearly €3 billion (about $3.5 billion) of WPP's 5.5-year bonds, even though the company only issued €1 billion (about $1.2 billion). The strong oversubscription suggests these institutional investors believe WPP will stay financially stable and meet its debt obligations. Rose, in her statement, said that her vision for WPP is clear and that AI would usher in a "golden age of marketing." Looking ahead to 2026, she said WPP's greatest opportunity is "to enable our clients to move boldly and confidently into the future and help them fully embrace AI innovation to reimagine growth and unleash their true potential."

Title: How Netflix’s WB Megadeal Stunned Hollywood — and Sparked a Fight From David Ellison

Who do you believe? The battle for control of Warner Bros. and HBO is coming down to an enormous bet on competing visions of the future of the entertainment industry. On Dec. 5, Netflix landed a whale of a deal that sent shock waves through the community. The streamer that has upended traditional Hollywood is planning to join the ranks of studio owners with an $87.2 billion agreement to acquire Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Netflix had managed to outflank David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance, which for nearly four months had been making increasingly rich offers for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including linear TV networks like CNN, TNT, HGTV and Food Network. Related Stories Josh Hutcherson on Why a 'Hunger Games' Return 'Wouldn't Take Any Convincing' and How 'I Love L.A.' and 'Five Nights at Freddy's 2' Got Him Out of a Major Slump Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson to Return for 'The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping' Ellison — angered by what he felt was an unfair sales process conducted by the Warner Bros. Discovery board and chief David Zaslav — played his next chess move on Dec. 8: Paramount announced a hostile takeover bid of $30 a share for WBD, a proposed pact with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. “We’re taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve transparency and the ability to make an informed decision,” Ellison told investors and analysts on a call, noting that WBD had not responded in any way to his company’s latest offer. “Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.” Popular on Variety Sarandos, at least publicly, was unruffled. “Today’s move was entirely expected,” he said at a UBS investor conference hours after Paramount made its move. “We have a deal done. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.” The trenches have been dug, and it will likely be weeks or months before it becomes clear what will happen to Warner Bros. Discovery. WBD said its board will review Paramount’s competing proposal (as required by law) and will issue a recommendation in 10 business days, by Dec. 19. But for the time being, Warner Bros. Discovery is still officially supporting the Netflix deal. The duel between Netflix and Paramount (and who knows if others will emerge) is shaping up to be the most contentious M&A brawl since the early 1990s, when John Malone and Barry Diller scrapped with Sumner Redstone over the acquisition of Paramount Pictures (with Redstone’s Viacom ultimately sealing the deal for the studio). In the war for Warner Bros., against the swirling backdrop of egos, money and market power, there’s another X factor: President Donald Trump, who has exerted control over federal agencies. On Dec. 7, while making his way down the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump declared that “I’ll be involved” in the approval process for the Netflix deal. According to Trump, Sarandos visited the Oval Office last week. During the meeting, the Netflix co-CEO sought to reassure the president that his company would not amass anything close to monopoly power — and that other media conglomerates would still be bigger than Netflix com bined with WB and HBO Max. Sarandos is “a fantastic man,” Trump said at the Kennedy Center. “I have a lot of respect for him, but it’s a lot of market share.” He added, “It could be a problem.” Meanwhile, Trump is friendly with Ellison and his billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. “They’re big supporters of mine,” Trump has boasted, and the president publicly praised David Ellison, saying, “He’ll do a great job” as CEO of the merged Skydance Media-Paramount. The Ellisons surely have been bending his ear in trying to persuade him to oppose Netflix’s WB gambit on anti-competitive grounds. But in a surprise turn, the Ellisons faced Trump’s lash — a sign of the fickle environment in D.C. in which the megamerger will be evaluated. The president slammed Paramount over an interview that ran on the Dec. 7 episode of “60 Minutes” featuring Georgia politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump friend-turned-foe. “My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP,” Trump fumed in a Truth Social post. On Monday, asked if he supported Paramount’s deal for WBD, Trump told reporters at a White House briefing, “I don’t know enough about it. I know the companies very well. I know what they are doing. But I have to see,” saying he has to look at how each proposed deal would impact market share for Netflix and Paramount Skydance. Trump added, “I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine. You know, I want to do what’s right.” Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, miscalculated in the fall when he triggered the bidding war for Warner Bros. by making an unsolicited offer to buy the company. Ellison’s theory was that, fresh off Skydance Media’s completion of the Paramount Global acquisition in August, he could move fast to preempt rival bidders by offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety ahead of WBD’s planned split into two parts next year. He knew other parties — which ended up being Comcast and Netflix — would be interested in buying just WBD’s streaming and studio divisions, and Ellison believed his was the cleaner, more compelling offer. In addition to the Ellison family’s backing, Paramount’s Dec. 1 offer included $24 billion in funding from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. But Ellison’s gambit drew out other bidders. During the auction process, Netflix’s two CEOs, Sarandos and Greg Peters, played their cards closer to the vest. In public, they were noncommittal about their interest in Warner Bros., even as they were already in touch with WBD about a potential deal. Peters, at a conference in early October, downplayed the company’s desire to grow through a major acquisition. “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers — they don’t have an amazing track record over time,” he said. Ellison, meanwhile, let it be known that going after Warner Bros. Discovery was all part of a master plan to scale Paramount to a global player. After chatter that Zaslav was leaning toward Netflix, Ellison and his team grew concerned they were losing the deal — and they were frustrated, as they felt they offered the higher premium and had been open about the importance of WBD to the larger strategic plan for Paramount Skydance. Paramount lawyers, in a Dec. 3 letter to Zaslav that was leaked to the press, alleged the board of Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a “myopic” bidding process “with a predetermined outcome” that favored Netflix. WBD’s lawyers responded that the board had “fully and robustly complied” with its fiduciary obligations. In a last-ditch scramble, Paramount extended its $30/share offer to WBD on Dec. 4. It was the sixth offer Paramount made to Warner Bros. over a 12-week span. “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets,” Ellison had texted Zaslav that day, according to a Paramount SEC filing revealing details of the M&A campaign. Ellison never received a reply. In the end, the Warner Bros. Discovery board got what it wanted in Netflix: a pedigreed, market-leading buyer with a solid financial foundation and a clear strategic need to make the most of Warner Bros. and HBO. Netflix’s bid of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros.’ streaming and studios arms was deemed higher than Paramount’s final offer of $30 a share for all of WBD (inclusive of the TV networks). Shortly after 5 a.m. PT last Friday, Sarandos jumped on a conference call with Wall Street analysts to tout the monster deal Netflix — once dismissed by the Hollywood establishment as a wannabe power player — had negotiated. “I know some of you are surprised that we’re making this acquisition,” Sarandos said on the predawn call, sounding exhausted but ebullient. The blockbuster deal, Sarandos enthused, would combine Warner Bros.’ “incredible library of shows and movies” — ranging from classics like “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to modern hit franchises like Harry Potter and “Friends” — with Netflix’s “culture-defining titles,” such as “Stranger Things,” “KPop Demon Hunters” and “Squid Game.” Under the pact, Netflix also would get the Warner Bros. Games division and the legendary Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. Sarandos had been up late the night before, putting the final touches on the WB deal after several marathon days of phone and video calls, emails and text-message chains. Netflix buttoned up the agreement with WBD and Zaslav at around 7 p.m. PT on Dec. 4. Among the final hurdles to securing the initial agreement was WBD’s insistence that Netflix commit to a record-setting $5.8 billion breakup fee should the deal run into resistance, regulatory or otherwise. Netflix said it expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations “and build on its strengths,” including maintaining theatrical releases for WB films. Currently, Warner Bros. has deals to release its movies in cinemas through 2029. In the near term, Netflix also will keep HBO Max as a discrete service. “Nothing is changing today,” the company told its millions of customers in an email sent Friday. But anyone who has experienced a Hollywood merger in recent decades knows that no matter what is said in the moment, the long-term arc of any business leans toward streamlining and eliminating redundancies. Netflix expects to see $2 billion-$3 billion in cost savings annually by the third year after the WB deal closes. Paramount said it saw upwards of $6 billion in cost synergies if it merged with Warner Bros. Discovery. And that, of course, signals looming layoffs on top of the thousands of job cuts the industry has seen in recent years. Opposition to the Netflix-WB deal assembled swiftly and fiercely across Hollywood, arising from unions, actors, directors, theater owners, consumer watchdogs and politicos on both sides of the aisle. Fueling the objections: In addition to the deal buttressing Netflix’s already formidable streaming lead with HBO Max and giving it control over the output of a major studio, Netflix has long shown an antipathy toward putting movies in theaters. Even if Netflix is derailed in its plans to swallow Warner Bros. — by Ellison’s rival bid or by regulatory agencies — the company has demonstrated a major flex. The fact that the 28-year-old streaming provider is now poised to own one of the biggest and oldest Hollywood studios cements the primacy of direct-to-consumer entertainment. Netflix, Sarandos suggested, can pull Warner Bros. and HBO into the future. “I think our more modern approach to the business model to connect people with these great stories is going to be a big win for all — every constituent involved,” he told investors. But movie theater operators are not feeling as upbeat, to put it mildly. Some theater owners are openly rooting against Netflix’s chance to vacuum up Warner Bros. The proposed deal “poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,” Michael O’Leary, CEO of trade group Cinema United, said in a statement. It will, he said, hurt theaters “from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.” Warners has been on a roll this year. It has been No. 1 in movie market share after releasing hits like “Sinners,” “A Minecraft Movie,” “Superman” and “Weapons” in theaters. Netflix does release some movies in theaters, but on hundreds of screens (or fewer), not thousands as with a typical wide release. And Netflix mainly debuts original movies in theaters to qualify for Oscars. Sarandos didn’t exactly give a ringing endorsement of the theatrical experience — which he earlier this year dubbed “outdated” — even as he promised to honor Warner Bros.’ commitments to release upcoming films in cinemas. “I think, over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer-friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are quicker,” he said Friday. David Ellison is trying to mine industry discontent over Netflix’s Warner Bros. play. On Monday Paramount pledged to release more than 30 films in theaters if it wins WBD — a swipe at Netflix. “Our focus is on expanding creative output, not dominating the sector, as Netflix envisions,” Ellison said. SEE ALSO: Paramount Claims WBD Is Overvaluing CNN, TBS and Other TV Networks — Alleging That Means Netflix’s Deal Is Worse for Shareholders If the Warner Bros. deal with Netflix goes through as outlined, Zaslav will eventually lose his CEO perch. It’s not known what role he might have if Paramount’s bid prevails. But if Zaslav does exit in the wake of a sale, he’ll gain many millions of dollars from stock and options and a bonus payout, as will senior WB and HBO execs. And if Netflix is the winning party, Zaslav also will have the satisfaction of having gone out on his own terms. Zaslav has been telling friends and colleagues that he’s focused on helping to get the Netflix merger to the finish line and to deliver a healthy Warner Bros. and HBO Max to Sarandos when it’s time to hand over the keys. What about Warner Bros.’ rank and file? Zaslav told staffers in a town hall meeting last Friday that the pending sale to Netflix is unlikely to result in sweeping layoffs, as the streamer’s “intention is that they want to keep most people.” Sarandos asserted that Netflix is “not cutting jobs,” whereas Paramount and Comcast have been “laying people off and cutting things.” As for handling movies, Sarandos emphasized that one of Warner Bros.’ strengths is its ability to distribute movies around the world. “We didn’t buy this company to destroy that value,” Sarandos observed. There will be a lot of back and forth in the days ahead as Paramount presses its case to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators. Netflix says it expects its deal to take 12-18 months, following WBD’s planned spinoff of its linear TV channels into Discovery Global in the third quarter. Paramount predicted it could complete a WBD takeover in 12 months. But Paramount’s challenge is likely to prolong the process for either buyer. Netflix’s WB-HBO Max deal represents a horizontal merger between rival streaming services as well as a vertical merger, adding a massive distribution pipeline for Warner Bros. content. “I don’t think this is a slam dunk for the companies,” says Spencer Weber Waller, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. That deal also would face scrutiny from European Union regulators and those in other countries, and Netflix may have to agree to restrictions or spinoffs to satisfy local regulators. Netflix execs voiced optimism that the WB acquisition will be OK’d. “[We are] really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,” Sarandos told analysts on Friday. Even if American regulators try to spike Netflix’s WB deal, that wouldn’t necessarily doom it. Recall that during Trump’s first term, the DOJ sued to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, claiming the merger constrained supply of “must-have” content, like CNN and TNT. (The lawsuit reportedly was motivated by Trump’s displeasure with CNN.) But a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies, and in February 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. A key question will be how to define the streaming marketplace. The Netflix and WBD teams suggested the enlarged company would still be competing for consumer dollars against the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Peacock, Disney+, Hulu and traditional TV. Moreover, all of them are vying for watch time with internet-video powerhouses YouTube and TikTok. But this may not be a convincing argument in an antitrust review. “The agencies do not believe that everything competes with everything,” Waller says. “There is not a general market for eyeballs.” At this point, after losing the hearts and minds of WBD’s board, David Ellison seems to be placing his chips on the narrative — pitched to the Trump administration, regulatory bodies across the globe and Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders — that Netflix would run afoul of antitrust laws if it got hold of Warner Bros. and HBO Max. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would have approximately 200 million global subscribers, “which puts us on par with Disney,” Ellison told investors. That’s significantly below Netflix and HBO Max, which together would clock in at more than 400 million. “Our deal is completely pro-competitive. It’s pro-creative talent, pro-consumer,” Ellison said. The Warner Bros.-Netflix combination, he asserted, “would give them such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer, and is anticompetitive in every way that you can fundamentally look at it.” In the coming weeks, Ellison’s Paramount Skydance is expected to come back to WBD with another formal takeover offer — one that would top its most recent $30/share bid. Netflix, of course, paints a different picture of its agreement with WBD. “We think it’s good for consumers. We think it’s good for creators,” Sarandos told investors. “We think it’s great for the entertainment industry as a whole, because we’re creating and protecting jobs in production.” Soon, Warner Bros. Discovery board members and shareholders will have to choose between dueling bids and dueling narratives.

Title: Inside tractor maker CNH’s push to bring more artificial intelligence to the farm

Time Published: 2025-12-10T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jay Schroeder, the chief technology officer of CNH, was recently in Brazil, discussing artificial intelligence use cases to support the company’s research and development team. The agricultural equipment maker has put a lot of effort into governance and assessing certified tools from vendors, but the actual application of the technology within its own research division remains very nascent. What has held Schroeder back, he says, are lingering concerns about the return on investment of AI. He cites an MIT study published over the summer that found that 95% of AI pilots fail. “It’s great that we’ve got people engaged in AI,” says Schroeder, who quickly pivots to ask rhetorically, “How do we measure success? What are the things that we can measure to say, ‘This has been a worthwhile investment for CNH?’” Schroeder, a three-decade veteran of CNH who began his career as an engineer focused on mid-range tractor transmission design, isn’t completely cautious when it comes to leveraging AI. The tech has been deployed across broad corners of the business including software development, to assist with drafting contracts, producing R&D database queries, and content management. CNH has scored some wins that Schroeder has been able to track. The company is leaning on AI to assist software engineers who are focused on precision agricultural technology and the FieldOps farm management systems, where AI, machine learning, and sensors are applied to digitally enhance farming. Early data has shown that these engineers are reducing the time needed for documentation by 60%, giving them more time to write new code. Another project underway involves AI-enabled spraying systems that use cameras and machine learning to detect the difference between weeds and planted crops when applying chemicals in the field. Farmers who use AI in this manner can reduce the amount of herbicides they use by 80%. Other applications have more nebulous gains. CNH’s engineers participated in a pilot program where they were able to use AI to pull field reports from dispersed datasets across the company. Within three minutes, this generative AI tool can produce a report that includes details about a design project, CNH’s standards for developing the gear, field test reports, and other key information. “Can you measure that?” asks Schroeder. He says that many hours are being saved from the work that would have gone into developing one of those reports manually in the past. But putting an exact figure on the time savings is more difficult. Investments in AI and other emerging technologies, like autonomous robots, have become central to the pitch made by CNH and other tractor suppliers as farmers face intense cost pressures and feelthe dire effects of climate change. In the United Kingdom, where the Dutch-incorporated CNH has its headquarters and main operations, heat and drought led to around $1 billion in lost production this year. Three of the five worst harvests in the history of the U.K. have occurred since 2020, according to the figures from the U.K.-based nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. Only 3% of the world’s land is suitable for crops, but the global population is growing by 35 million each year, according to CNH. Farmers have to squeeze out more efficiencies in the field to meet that rising demand. “The biggest impact on a farmer’s profitability is the yield, besides commodity prices, obviously,” says Gerrit Marx, CEO of CNH, which ranks No. 217 on the Fortune 500 Europe. “In the end, we want to help the farmer make better decisions.” Farm-equipment suppliers have been squeezed by the impact of tariffs, which has led to weakening demand for their expensive tractors, combines, and harvesters. Last month, CNH reported weaker year-over-year sales for the company’s third quarter, as shipments slowed to dealers that have been working their way through excess inventories. But even as it faces those headwinds, CNH has vowed to invest nearly $5 billion over five years into its U.S. manufacturing and R&D facilities. “The solutions we’re developing for AG [agriculture] are really helping to feed the world,” says Schroeder. “I grew up on a family farm…so for me, it’s personal.” CNH’s primary technology partner is Microsoft, and the company has been in active conversations with the tech giant to deploy some AI tools to support precision-technology product development. Already, all CNH employees have access to the free, web-based version of Microsoft Copilot, and about 1,000 of the “AI power users” have access to the premium license. The company’s precision agricultural tech AI projects, Schroeder says, are still “mostly in the pilot phase. We have a long hill to climb.” One AI tool that CNH launched externally at the beginning of 2025 is the “AI Tech Assistant,” which was deployed to hundreds of agricultural and construction dealer groups to field questions about any issues for CNH-branded machinery and propose a repair plan. Marx says that every member of CNH’s global leadership team is running at least one generative or agentic AI pilot program within their respective fields. He says CNH is looking for tangible benefits to business outcomes. One area of increased focus is the application of generative AI to produce conversational, real-time insights that can connect the dots between the seeds, fertilizers, and equipment a farmer has at their disposal, as well as current and near-future weather patterns, to help improve crop management and planning. “Tomorrow, the agronomist will become a set of agentic AIs that help the farmer to make bigger decisions better,” says Marx. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The emerging federal-versus-state battle to regulate AI. In the wake of around 100 different laws adopted by 38 states during this year’s legislative session, President Trump this week moved to issue an executive order that would aim to prevent state's from passing laws restricting AI. Over-regulating AI, Trump and his allies believe, will make it harder for the U.S. to compete with China. But state governors have expressed fears about the impact of AI—on hiring and employment, consumer protection, fraud, and other risks—motivating them to act in absence of federal regulations. Nvidia wins Trump’s blessing to sell AI chips in China. On Tuesday, Trump announced that he had granted Nvidia permission to sell the company’s H200 AI chip to China, giving the AI chip maker an opportunity to chase billions in orders from the market that would purportedly only go to “approved customers.” But, the Financial Timesreported that China would limit access to H200 chips and that buyers would likely need to go through an approval process that would require them to explain why domestic providers are unable to meet their needs. Nike cuts CTO role; Deere CIO retires. Athletic-gear giant Nike has eliminated two C-suite roles, including the CTO position, as CEO Elliott Hill aims to eliminate “layers” to accelerate a turnaround plan. CTO Muge Dogan is departing after just two years in the role. She previously spent more than 16 years at Amazon. Meanwhile, Deere & Co. announced that CIO Raj Kalathur would retire in January after 28 years at the agricultural machinery manufacturer. Kalathur has served as CIO since 2019 and oversaw Deere’s IT function and John Deere Financial, the financial-services provider for dealers and customers that buy the company’s equipment. Deere didn’t provide further details on who would succeed Kalathur. IBM scoops up Confluent for $11 billion. Shares of data-streaming platform Confluent jumped after the company agreed to a $31-per-share cash takeover offer from IBM. It's one of the tech giant’s largest takeovers ever in a deal that will bolster its AI offerings. IBM says that it expects that global data demand will more than double by 2028 and asserts that the IBM-Confluent combination will enable better and faster deployment of generative and agentic AI. As Bloomberg reports, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has led efforts to reposition the company’s business around selling AI-related services to clients and buying up software companies. Those efforts appear to be paying off, with around 80% of IBM’s 300 clients who buy AI products being new over the past two quarters, IBM told the Wall Street Journal when it reported earnings in October. New York Times, Chicago Tribune sue Perplexity. The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have sued Perplexity, saying the AI startup is copying and distributing their exclusive content. This adds to a growing list of more than 40 court cases in the U.S. in which copyright holders have sued AI companies, the Times reports. The Times was also in court last week for its ongoing litigation with OpenAI, with the latter suffering a legal blow after a federal judge ruled that the ChatGPT maker must produce millions of anonymized chat logs from its users in a copyright case that stems from a late 2023 lawsuit by the news organization. EY says that AI-driven gains are being pumped into reinvestment, not job cuts. While headlines continue to swirl around AI's impact on jobs—including the recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas that AI has been responsible for nearly 55,000 job layoffs in 2025—consulting giant EY is making the case that savings in AI are far more likely to be poured back into the business. Nearly all business leaders (96%) report AI-driven gains in productivity, but they are far more focused on reinvesting than eliminating jobs. When asked what they've done with the dollars saved from AI, these leaders report spending to support existing AI capabilities (47%), develop new AI capabilities (42%), strengthen cybersecurity (41%), invest in R&D (39%), and upskilling and reskilling employees (38%), according to consulting giant EY’s fourth AI Pulse Survey. Only 17% report those gains led to reduced headcount. “We see that a lot of companies are coming back with positive returns and are getting even more bullish in what their investment theses are,” Dan Diasio, EY global consulting AI leader, tells Fortune. “More of those executives are putting more capital towards AI, many of them doubling what their investments were over the course of the next 12 months.” The EY survey data aligns with Diasio's thinking. About 27% of respondents currently commits a quarter or more of their IT budget to AI, but that share of respondents is projected to nearly double to 52% in 2026. The group that spends half or more of their IT budget on AI is expected to quintuple, to 19% next year from just 3% today.

She will continue to report directly to CEO Brian Chambers. - Westfield appointed Lloyd Scholz as enterprise CIO, joining the property and casualty insurance company after most recently serving as senior managing director and CTO at insurance provider Markel. Prior to Markel, Scholz spent 16 years at credit-card giant Capital One in leadership roles focused on data engineering, analytics platforms, cloud strategy, and enterprise technology. - DXC Technology promoted Russell Jukes to serve as chief digital information officer, an expanded role to oversee the IT services and consulting company’s end-to-end digital and AI agenda. Jukes has worked for DXC since 2017, when the company was formed through the merger of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s enterprise services business division and Computer Sciences Corporation.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

Title: What Hollywood's real-life drama means for you

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you? Americans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and "Game of Thrones." The headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants. The reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies. "If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now," said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics. Now that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in "synergies" that will likely result in cuts. "The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is," said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers. Additionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle. It all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels. Whoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said. "Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions," he said. It's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made. "This is one less entity writing checks," said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning "The Favourite." Paramount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017. The dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%). That's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models. "The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form," Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said. Jump to

Title: AI is driving a workforce transformation

Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:00:00Z

Getty Images The rapid influx of AI in its various forms is inevitably leading to workforce transformation. What is less clear is exactly how the transformation will play out. AI is a factor in several recent layoffs at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft and other companies. However, there's evidence that while AI may affect jobs that require manual or routine labor, it will also spur job growth and productivity gains. There appears to be little doubt AI will be an integral part of workers' lives going forward. According to research presented at the Gartner IT Symposium in October, a survey of CIOs by Gartner indicates that by 2030, they expect 0% of IT work will be done by humans without AI, 75% will be done by humans augmented with AI and 25% will be done by AI alone. TechTarget spoke with Graig Paglieri, CEO of Randstad Digital, about the changing nature of the workforce. Randstad Digital, a division of the Netherlands-based global staffing company Randstad, focuses on providing workers to meet the digital transformation needs of enterprises. The firm operates across four vertical areas -- customer experience, cloud and infrastructure, data and analytics, and product engineering. Paglieri discusses how the AI transformation is affecting jobs and some of the characteristics of the Gen Z generation that's currently entering the workforce. Editor's note: The following transcript was edited for length and clarity. How do you view the current workforce transformation? For example, Gartner research indicates that 0% of work will be done without AI help by 2030, and 25% will be done by AI agents alone. Graig Paglieri: I agree with those proportions and ratios. We're already seeing it significantly in developer roles. It's not that they're completely going away and being replaced by agents, but instead of a company needing four or five developers, they need one or two. There's definitely that augmented agent support. The shift toward components of tech modernization that can be outsourced to an agent is the roadmap. There's evidence that many jobs will be lost to AI, but we also hear that AI will create other jobs. What are you seeing? Paglieri: There's going to be both. There are going to be jobs that are lost, and there will be challenges around upskilling and repurposing some roles. But companies that are ahead of the game are going to transform the way they operate with AI in mind. For example, internally, our recruiting function has been tech-enabled for many years, but with agentic AI and the move to more platform capabilities, the recruiter role will shift. We're not going to need recruiters trying to find people on a job board, source them, match them and see if they're available. All of that can be done through AI technology. But can [the recruiters] do a better job of advising the talent that's been identified on the right role? Can they manage their onboarding? Can they help redeploy them to their next assignment? Those are a lot of the services and functions that get lost today because so much time is spent on the front end dealing with manual, fragmented and cumbersome processes. A significant aspect of the transformation involves Gen Z workers entering the workforce. What are some characteristics of how these workers are being integrated into the workforce? Paglieri: Recent Randstad Digital research shows a small percentage of them -- under 5% -- plan to spend more than 10 years in their company. This can make it challenging, particularly in professional services where it's a big commitment both for the organization and the employee to become productive. They're not recognizing that this is going to take multiple years in phases to develop the skills and capabilities to advance rather than just moving on to the next thing. Flexibility ties into that, too. Forty-five percent of the people we polled said flexibility was the most important factor. Compensation's there, but there's this idea that they're not going to be bogged down by geography and working in the office. Having different, flexible hours is way more important than in past generations. The AI-focused workforce transformation seems to be having a greater effect on entry-level positions. How does the incoming workforce generation deal with that, and how do companies deal with the experience gaps that this will likely produce? Paglieri: This is where the importance of softer skills might come in -- the ability to differentiate and distinguish yourself. The human aspect of your value is more valuable than someone else, where maybe being more technically proficient in the past isn't quite as critical. But it's also where flexibility comes in as well -- taking internships, recognizing that you're not necessarily going to go right into what you thought was your desired field. Are you being flexible enough in finding ways into the workforce? But companies also have to continue to change their expectations and how they're bringing in and onboarding talent, and recognize that there's a need to have balance based on this disruption that's with us. Where is AI affecting the job market now, as some jobs that were hot a few years ago may be going away? What jobs are needed now? Paglieri: First, the economy and market conditions are adding to the dilemma that we're in, so it's not just AI. That has this compounding effect -- AI is creating some disruption and uncertainty, and the macro environment is as weird and wacky as it's ever been. Where is it going? There's a ton of work that needs to be done -- for digital transformation in particular. We're going to see roles such as project managers and business analysts -- which may have slowed down a little bit now because of that AI uncertainty -- pick back up as these engagements need to move faster. That human-in-the-loop with technology role is still critical. Having a foundation in AI skills and some other technical skills is important. What's your overall feeling about the job market in the next few years? Optimism or pessimism? Paglieri: It's definitely optimism. We're in the later stages of the first chapter [of the AI transformation], which starts with a lot of enthusiasm and energy. It also applies to tech services in general. There's been lots of growth, but now there's been a little bit of plateauing. There's still so much digital transformation work that needs to be done that 2026 is going to have a lot more growth opportunity than we've seen in 2025 -- and certainly [more than we] saw in 2024. We're starting to see some early signs of that, and 2027 and 2028 are going to be more productive and positive than 2026.

Title: An AI bubble burst? Early warning signs and how to prepare

KOHb - Getty Images The impending end of an AI bubble could signal a fresh start for some AI technology companies. AI technology has captured the attention of consumers and investors alike due to its rapid innovation and potential for profit, resulting in a surge of AI tools flooding the market. But, despite a wave of innovation, few initiatives made it past the development phase. This was because they were built on fragmented tools and were too disconnected from business goals, according to Juan Jose Lopez Murphy, head of data science at Globant. The situation made some investors uncomfortable. "The frustration we experience, which some call deflation, is fatigue from too many models and too little strategy," Lopez Murphy said. "Instead of investors and executives pulling back completely, we are starting to see a shift of focus from volume to value." Investors are now looking for projects that deliver measurable outcomes that are sustainable across teams and systems, resulting in a more disciplined market, he said. The big difference between what's happening now and previous investment bubbles is that AI technology is real in terms of actual value that it brings, said Matt Hasan, PhD and CEO of aiRESULTS Inc. As an AI strategist and an economist, Hasan said he looks at the market through two lenses -- the technology and the money chasing it. Unrealistic expectations have led to overinvestment in generative AI, and according to an MIT report, 95% of organizations are experiencing zero return. Investment is currently outpacing value. "The risk comes from how fast investors have piled in," Hasan said. "Money is flowing into data centers, chips and startups a lot faster than real adoption can keep up. The hype is moving ahead of actual business value." Three critical factors differentiate this bubble from others, according to Jonathan Bittner, CEO of Dimensional Analytics. Those ways include the following: Forrester predicted an AI market correction in 2026 as organizations grapple with the ever-widening gap between inflated vendor promises and actual value delivered. With fewer than one-third of decision-makers able to tie the value of AI to their organization's financial growth, CEOs will rely on CFOs to approve AI investments based on ROI in 2026, according to the report. "In 2026, the AI hype period ends as the pressure to deliver real, measurable results from secure AI initiative intensifies," Sharyn Leaver, chief research officer at Forrester, said in a report. "As the era of volatility continues, tech and security leaders will be called upon to recalibrate investments under tighter financial scrutiny and governance while navigating increasingly complex geopolitical and economic risks." Hasan has seen some deflation as venture funding cools off, valuations level out and companies realize that promised gains are taking longer to show up. "That's not collapse -- that's a pause to catch our breath," Hasan said. More red flags are visible if you look deeper, Bittner said, including the following: A bubble burst won't kill AI, just the unrealistic expectations surrounding it, Hasan said. He believes that companies focused on solving real problems will emerge stronger. Bittner shares Hasan's optimistic outlook. He said the burst itself would hit organizations in three waves, including the following: "The AI bubble burst could mark the beginning of a healthier, more focused innovation cycle for AI. Enterprises may start consolidating budgets for projects or slow down hypothetical projects," Lopez Murphy said. "This period doesn't mean that innovation is stopping altogether but rather showing maturity in prioritizing projects." He believes that emphasis will shift to building frameworks that will last in the long term. As the threat of an AI bubble burst looms closer, industry leaders will have to see through the hype and focus on AI technology that solves tangible business problems. Hasan advises leaders to stay grounded, tie AI projects to clear results and track costs. "If businesses keep their heads and focus on real impact, a correction won't be a disaster. It'll be a reset, and a healthy one," he said. Bittner added his own recommendations, including the following: For Hasan and Bittner a bubble burst would signal a new, more efficient approach to AI technology investments. "The bubble pop won't be a disaster. It will be a reset. And America's hard-working, smart people will use that reset to revolutionize the economy with AI -- the right way," Bittner said. "It will always be about the people. Not the algorithms." Julie Hanson is a freelance writer who has reported on local news across Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Cristin Dorgelo, then with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, at a conference in Albany, N.Y., on Oct. 23, 2012. Dorgelo is now the CEO of a new nonprofit called Government Renewal. Albany Times Union / Hearst Newspapers / Getty Images Stay Connected Sean Michael Newhouse A group of former federal leaders, many of whom served during the Obama and Biden administrations, is launching a new organization called Government Renewal to improve government operations and services. “[We’re] looking at not just efficiency but also effectiveness and whether the way in which the government is working is really building trust with the American people,” said Cristin Dorgelo, the CEO of the new organization who served as a senior advisor in the Office of Management and Budget between from 2021 to 2023. “That's the opportunity we have today: Both to look at those cross-cutting systems that power all of the government's work and some of those specific agencies that have a particularly high impact on people's lives like Social Security.” Nicole Wong, an outside advisor to Government Renewal and former deputy U.S. chief technology officer under Obama, said the organization will focus on government personnel, procurement and operations. While both Dorgelo and Wong also have Silicon Valley experience, Wong said the goal isn’t to make agencies operate like the private sector. Rather, she wants the federal government’s services to be as good as those from a corporation. “Amazon will deliver my groceries in half an hour to my house. Government needs to deliver at the speed and with the ease that people have come to be used to in their lives,” Wong said. “So the task of focusing on operational capacity is to make that a reality.” The Trump administration itself has prioritized improving governmental operations, promising that mass layoffs of federal employees will generate increased efficiencies. And the Department of Government Efficiency, which had been headed by tech mogul Elon Musk, was created to help modernize government technology; although, it’s better known for spearheading agency workforce cuts. Dorgelo, however, said that Government Renewal is nonpartisan and is not meant to be a foil to DOGE. She said the organization also would be open to collaborating with Republicans, so long as their focus is on strengthening government services. “This is a project that is born out of a desire to improve how the government delivers,” she said. “It is not a response to specific actions underway today, and that means we need to look at how the government has been working over the course of quite a number of years, and to be looking at ideas for what would improve that in the years to come, and to be ready to start implementing those ideas as soon as a window opens to do so.” Dorgelo added that Government Renewal’s efforts are currently underway, but that they’ll reach “full swing” in 2026. She also said that Government Renewal is operating as a nonprofit, but Dorgelo declined to answer specifically how the organization plans to secure funding, such as through individual donations or grants. Some of the organization’s other outside advisors include: Dorgelo said that Government Renewal also plans to work with other groups similarly focused on improving government operations like NYU’s Tax Law Center and the Federation of American Scientists. “When I started my career in government, there were fewer groups outside of government thinking about government capacity issues and government operations. Today, we see a growing array of groups working in this space,” she said. “Our goal is to be adding value to those efforts, fostering connections among those efforts and spotting gaps where we can spot partners who might be able to fill and address those gaps in developing actionable options.” Related articles Ex-feds join forces to reimagine government post-Trump Share your news tips with us: Sean Michael Newhouse: snewhouse@govexec.com, Signal: seanthenewsboy.45 NEXT STORY: Push to 'reform the government root and branch' detailed in Trump’s new management agenda Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

Title: Amazon Multiplayer Game Reportedly Got 10x Fewer Players Than It Was Hoping For

king of meat King of Meat developer Glowmade will layoff “around a dozen people” early next year, according to a new report from Insider Gaming. These “voluntary redundancies” come just two months after the multiplayer party game hit Steam and after it reportedly failed to hit an ambitious 100,000 concurrent player target. King of Meat peaked at just 320 people on PC instead. Over the past few days, several Glowmade developers posted to LinkedIn that they’re looking for work. The U.K.-based studio published King of Meat in October, backed by Amazon Game Studio. Insider Gaming reported that discussions around the layoffs began earlier in December, and that leadership previously told staff the studio “had the runway to keep going.” Amazon Game Studios announced in 2021 that it was expanding its publishing efforts with Glowmade, which was working on an “exciting new IP.”Â Glowmade had 25 staffers, according to a news release at the time. The studio’s leadership was reportedly hoping King of Meat would reach “a concurrent player count of at least 100,000,” but instead failed to maintain 1,000 players across platforms. On Steam, King of Meat had a recent 24-hour peak of 23 players; its top concurrent player number there is 320 players, according to SteamDB. Most people probably only remember it as the game with the flashy trailer at Gamescom 2024 which featured an animated version of Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley. That memorable moment could have cost close to half a million dollars, but apparently didn’t do much to keep King of Meat bubbling around in the popular consciousness. King of Meat‘s October release didn’t go well despite a huge marketing push, including a big-budget MrBeast video. The video, which included a whole dang set, more than a dozen content creators, and a $250,000 prize, is essentially a mini-King of Meat esports event. It was published just after King of Meat‘s release date and racked up 6.8 million views. Kotaku has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment.

Title: Chasing WBD: Paramount vs. Netflix Pros and Cons | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-12-09T14:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Paramount’s hostile bid puts its offer against Netflix public, but which company has the sweeter deal? The clash between Netflix and Paramount for the legendary Warner Bros. Discovery is getting downright medieval. Paramount on Monday swooped in with a tender offer to shareholders, launching a hostile bid with what it believes is a superior $30-a-share all-cash offer for the entire company. It comes just three days after WBD and Netflix said they had agreed to a cash-and-stock deal. WBD, which so far hasn’t changed its recommendation on Netflix, said it would carefully review the Paramount offer and advise its shareholders within 10 days. It marks the latest swerve in the increasingly tangled soap opera that has been the pursuit of WBD. That the bidding war has reached the hostile stage underscores the stakes surrounding the deal, with either Netflix or Paramount acquiring all or parts of Warner Bros. representing a seismic shift in Hollywood. On the surface, these competing bids represent a contest between a quick, short-term gain with Paramount vs. the longer term prospect of higher returns with Netflix. The upshot is the public will soon get a lot more detail about the deal than normal, with Paramount laying its cards on the table and WBD obligated to disclose additional information justifying its decision. Ellison and the Paramount camp were left furious with WBD for going with Netflix’s bid considering their bid offered more money, and there was some inkling things would turn this way after Paramount sent a note to WBD CEO David Zaslav last week complaining about the “tainted” bidding process that was filled with “management conflict.” The hostile bid will give shareholders more of a direct hand in deciding which way the company goes, with Netflix only seeking the studio and streaming business, leaving the cable assets to spin off as a separate business, while Paramount is looking to acquire the entire company. Here’s a breakdown of the pros, cons and different factors for each offer. Netflix is offering $23.25 a share in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock for each share of WBD, a total value of $27.75. But WBD is scheduled to spin off its cable assets, which include CNN, TNT, HGTV and several other networks, in the third quarter of 2026. WBD shareholders will also receive shares in this spin-off. Pros: Netflix, which is flush with cash and in a strong financial position, already has the board’s blessing. This scenario would also be the one in which the most jobs will be saved, since there are fewer redundant positions with Netflix not owning a studio, a point Zaslav made on Friday. Cons: Netflix faces significantly more regulatory scrutiny. While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, outside observers have said it could take two years or longer. For shareholders, that means having their money locked up longer after more than three years of lackluster stock performance. Walking away means WBD has to pay Netflix $2.8 billion in fees. X Factor: Paramount might have been feeling more confident in its hostile bid after Hollywood erupted in fear and anger over the prospect of Netflix accumulating even more power in the entertainment world. Netflix has already disrupted the industry, including killing residuals and profit-sharing deals that allow creatives to share in the financial success of their films and shows. Expect a number of trade groups and guilds to lobby lawmakers against the deal. Trump Factor: Sarandos met with Trump in late November to discuss the planned purchase of Warner Bros. and has been quietly nurturing his relationship with the president since he returned to the White House. Trump on Sunday called Sarandos “fantastic,” but noted the outsized market share and competition raised questions. TheWrap Take: On the surface, Netflix faces a massive mountain to climb from a regulatory perspective, with the company controlling the No. 1 and No. 3 streaming services — giving antitrust officials a pretty clear case to oppose it. But Netflix appears to be building its case for approval on the central issue of jobs. The company has said it plans to run Warner Bros. as-is, and noted it’s getting into new areas with its studio business, which means keeping more jobs intact. “[President Trump’s] interest in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs. Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,” Sarandos told an investor conference hosted by UBS. “We’re not cutting jobs. We’re making jobs.” Those synergies were a shot at Paramount’s projected $6 billion in merger cost savings, triple the amount Netflix had projected, signaling that the Paramount route would lead to more dramatic job cuts on top of the layoffs it’s still working through internally. Both Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters talked up Netflix’s investment in the U.S. across all 50 states, and how it’s contributed $125 billion into the U.S. economy over the last several years — clearly playing to the White House. The upshot: For shareholders, the calculus will be whether they are willing to gamble on the potential longer term gains both from Discovery Global’s spinoff and the rise in Netflix shares (the streamer’s share price dropped 3.4% on Monday). While the cable business is gradually shrinking, it still generates a ton of revenue and profits. You can look to the Comcast spinoff of Versant for a sense of how a business could be potentially valued (hint: it’s more than zero, as Ellison tried to suggest). If shareholders start to get swayed by Paramount’s bid, Lloyd Greif, president and CEO of investment bank Greif & Co., said Netflix could always sweeten its own offer. “[Netflix] can outbid deep-pocketed Larry Ellison, because at some point he decides the juice isn’t worth the squeeze,” Greif told TheWrap. “Larry’s a relative newcomer to Hollywood. Not so Netflix, which has been playing the role of entertainment industry spoiler since inception.” Pros: Paramount’s offer is much cleaner, with the company offering all cash for the entire business. Ellison’s primary sales pitch is that it can get shareholders more money and faster, with his father Larry Ellison a close ally with Trump. He expects a deal to be approved in less than a year. Cons: Paramount, already saddled with considerable debt, is taking on even more with this deal. And even with the backing of David’s father, that raises questions about its financial flexibility in the long run. The deal almost entirely discounts the value of Discovery Global, which Ellison said on CNBC could be worth close to nothing if spun out. The company is also targeting $6 billion merger cost savings, three times the amount Netflix projected, signaling heavier job cuts (Paramount is still going through cuts of its own). X Factor: When Skydance swooped in to buy Paramount, it was seen as a savior and best-case scenario for the storied media company. But the quick accumulation of power (Larry Ellison also has a controlling stake in TikTok’s U.S. business) and some of his decisions — like the appointment of Bari Weiss as head of CBS News — have rankled many in the industry who are disturbed by what they see as a Trump-aligned takeover. Ellison has taken a massive $24 billion in funding from three Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds for the bid, which has also raised eyebrows over foreign ownership of critical media assets. Trump Factor: Adding Weiss and working with government funds like Saudi Arabia were both seen as moves designed to curry favor with Trump. But as evidence of how unpredictable Trump is, this morning he attacked “60 Minutes” and Paramount just after the takeover was announced. TheWrap Take: Ellison’s offer and sales pitch is simple: Get more cash sooner with us. The downside is you won’t be participating in any upside from Discovery Global since it will be part of Paramount. Hostile bids have a mixed track record of success, with few examples of attempts in the media business working out. Analysts over the weekend had pontificated on whether Ellison needed to raise his offer, considering this was already reviewed and rejected by the WBD board. Still, this is a highly unusual situation with an unpredictable Trump White House, and David’s father Larry has actually won a hostile takeover himself when Oracle acquired Peoplesoft in 2005. Paramount needs the acquisition to scale up and better compete with giants like Amazon, Apple and, yes, Netflix. The upshot: While there are a lot of people in Hollywood terrified of Netflix’s potential to disrupt the industry, there’s likely others just as uneasy with Paramount’s power and its ties to Trump and, more recently, to the three sovereign wealth funds, which TheWrap previously identified as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). And while Paramount has a smoother road to regulatory approval, the idea of it buying another studio may still raise antitrust concerns, and Trump’s opinions on the company seems to change by the day. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and CEO of Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, believes financially coercing a company never works in the entertainment industry, noting the longer term reputational damage from such a move. “It’s very easy to become seen as the Darth Vader in the media business, and then you’re no longer a magnet for top talent, and as you lose that top creative talent, you’re also going to lose viewership,” Sonnenfeld told TheWrap. For an industry already devastated by consolidation, it’s choosing between the lesser of two evils. Netflix could disrupt the industry and harm the theatrical business. Paramount could slash even more jobs and produce fewer films after consolidating studio assets. It’s no wonder Snen. Elizabeth Warren, on the heels of slamming the Netflix-WBD deal as an “anti-monopoly nightmare,” called the Paramount hostile bid “a trap to set higher prices” on Monday. For shareholders, it’s a simpler choice of opting between cashing out with Paramount in about a year or sticking it out longer to benefit from the potential upside of Discovery Global and Netflix shares. The question is, ultimately, who comes up with the highest credible offer? “They’re both credible companies,” said Charles Elson, founding director of University of Delaware’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “Obviously, Netflix has done very well and Paramount is backed by quite a wealthy individual family. But it’s ultimately, who pays and has the most money.” Lucas Manfredi contributed to this story.

Title: Are we in a recession? Maybe professional Santas can tell us

Greg Rosalsky A professional Santa Bennett Raglin/Getty Images North America hide caption 'Tis the season to be jolly. That is, unless you're a worker who was banking on getting a seasonal job and haven't been able to find one this season. Every year, American retailers hire extra help as the holiday shopping season approaches. In recent years, these jobs have numbered roughly around half a million per season. These seasonal jobs run the gamut. Think temporary cashiers, gift wrappers, sales associates, greeters, merchandisers, warehouse unloaders, delivery drivers. But the quintessential — and most iconic — seasonal worker has got to be… Santa Claus. In addition to sliding down chimneys to deliver presents on Christmas, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas takes gigs at places like malls, department stores, corporate events, and private parties in the weeks leading up to Dec. 25. However, this year, Santa may be making fewer trips from the North Pole than in years past. As we report in this week's Planet Money newsletter, demand for professional Santas seems to have cooled. It's one small part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this holiday season. It got us wondering how the market for Santas fluctuates with the business cycle, which sectors of the Santa market are recession-proof, and whether a decline in Santa demand this season could be a sign that the U.S. economy is going down the chimney. Mitch Allen is the founder and "Head Elf" at Hire Santa, an agency that provides Santas for holiday events around the nation and world (we talked to Allen in a past Planet Money newsletter). Allen estimates there are probably around nine or ten thousand professional or "near professional" Santa Clauses in the United States. Sure, Allen says, his company may occasionally get requests for Santa at "Christmas in July"-style events, when Santa shows up in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops. But, no surprise, prime time for his business is right now. He says demand for Santa typically begins in early November, picks up steam on weekends in December and explodes the week before Christmas, especially on Christmas Eve. "It really falls off after Christmas Eve, like midnight Christmas Eve," Allen says. Allen says he's seeing less demand for Santa visits this season. His leading indicator for Santa demand is what he calls "leads," or inquiries to his business to book Santa at events. On that metric, he says, "we're down almost 27% year to date, compared with last year. And last year was down compared with the year before." My family has experienced this decline in Santa appearances first hand. Last year, when our son was about 15 months old, we took him for his first time to sit on Santa's lap. A hotel in Lake Tahoe had a public event that served as a toy drive for Toys for Tots. There was festive music, ice skating, skiing, hot chocolate, sleigh rides, and, of course, Santa. To be honest, our son was too young to understand why we were putting him on an old, bearded man's lap, but the whole experience was fun for us parents and we got cute pictures. We wanted to go back this year, but the hotel decided not to host its community event this year. No Santa. Bah, humbug! We're living through a weird economic moment right now, with mixed signals about how good or bad the economy is doing. And we just had the longest government shutdown in American history, which not only hurt the economy, but basically created a blackout for official economic statistics. Since the end of the shutdown, the Trump administration has delayed and even canceled some economic reports, and we're now all sort of in the dark, trying to figure out what the heck the economy really looks like right now. But there are some candles illuminating what's going on — and this seeming decline of demand for Santa could be one small one suggesting that the overall economy is sleighing downward. It's part of a broader decline in the demand for seasonal workers this year, something a number of sources have reported in recent weeks. For instance, back in late September, Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, a human-resources firm, released their annual seasonal hiring report. They projected that hiring this holiday retail season would "fall to its lowest point since the recession-hit season of 2009." Part of the story could be that holiday shopping is increasingly moving online, and brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling and maybe hiring less help. That's an ongoing, long-term structural change to the economy that doesn't say much about whether we're heading into recession. However, there are a number of signs that softened demand for seasonal workers is related more to a broader slowdown in the economy. Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, told us we haven't seen a miraculous turnaround in the market for seasonal workers since they issued their projection back in late September. Even more, he says, the broader labor market seems to have only gotten worse since they made their projection. In November, his company, which also tracks layoffs, reported an alarming spike in companies announcing layoffs. That includes prominent online retailers like Amazon and delivery companies like UPS. "So we have two signals, and both are not good for the labor market or seasonal hiring," Challenger says. Likewise, Indeed Hiring Lab, which leverages the job site Indeed's large amount of data to provide insights about the labor market, recently reported they're also seeing bad news in the job market this season. "What we're seeing right now in seasonal hiring is kind of a microcosm of what we're seeing in the broader labor market, which is that things are cooling down, things are slowing down," says Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official body that calls recessions, defines a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months" (listen to our Planet Money episode, "Recession Referees," for more about this). The lack of official economic statistics for the last few months makes it hard to say whether we're on our way to a recession — or whether we're already in one. But, while reporting this story, we've found ourselves wondering: could declining demand for Santa visits during the holidays potentially be a recession indicator? Like, can it be a sign we're in a ho-ho-horrible economy? Do paid Santa appearances boom in good economic times and go bust during recessions? Or is demand for Santa fairly recession-proof? Hire Santa didn't officially launch until 2012 — after the Great Recession — and Head Elf Allen couldn't tell us much about the hard data on how Santa demand fluctuates over the business cycle. Moreover, his business doesn't capture the full market for Santa, including DIY Santas where people buy or rent Santa costumes and do events themselves. But Allen did offer us a theory of how he thinks demand for professional Santas is affected by recessions. For one, he says, there will always be parts of the economy where demand for Santa is fairly recession-proof. He says that many businesses use Santa appearances to "help drive traffic and associate their brand with Christmas." In this way, a store or mall paying for Santa to sit in a chair and converse with children could be seen as a kind of loss leader, a product or service that costs a company money as a way to attract more customers, nudge them to shop, and help their business make more money. Think like free or cheap alcohol at a casino. Allen says that, even in recessions, certain types of businesses and organizations will always want to hire Santa. "But I don't think that translates to a company party or a home visit," Allen says. "That's not something that you have to have. You can go to the mall and see Santa. You can go to outdoor stores and see Santa. You can see Santa if you want to. You don't have to have 'em come to your home or office." Indeed, that's a pattern that Allen believes he's seeing with a cursory look at his company's data. He believes the primary driver of the decline of demand for paid Santa visits is from private holiday parties and events. "Consumers are not reaching out to have Santa or Mrs. Claus or other holiday entertainers come to their home or office for a Christmas party," Allen says. "And so I view that as like people scaling back their own Christmas plans. They may still be having parties but they're not having sort of blowout parties with Santa and other holiday characters there." Allen pointed to recent reports that companies are laying off workers and that consumer credit card debt is at an all time high. It makes sense why people might be scaling back. So, yeah, maybe a big decline in Santa appearances could be a recession indicator. The good news, Allen says, is that, while overall demand is down, he's still seeing plenty of requests for Santa. In other words, don't worry, Santa is coming to town. There just might be fewer places or times to see him this year. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Tomb Raider reveal confirmed for The Game Awards as devs tease return of iconic dual-pistol Lara Croft: "Did you miss her?"

"She missed you" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been more than seven years since Shadow of the Tomb Raider put a bow on Lara Croft's big reboot trilogy, and since then, series fans have been desperate for even a morsel of information on what's coming next. Now, finally, it seems relief is in sight, as a big Tomb Raider reveal has been teased for The Game Awards later this week. "Did you miss her?" the official Tomb Raider account asks on Twitter. "She missed you." The message encourages you to tune into the annual TGA showcase on December 11 "for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises." The news was initially revealed in Fortnite, as part of a TGA-branded island built for players to vote on their favorite fanmade creations in the battle royale hub. The teaser includes an image showing a silhouette of Lara Croft posing proudly with the old-school dual pistols that helped define her appearance in the original 1996 game. If you squint just hard enough, you can just about make out pouches and holster straps around her legs that hint at the old costume, too. Did you miss her? She missed you. 🔫As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider#TombRaider #Fortnite #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/IiN3jPQSkSDecember 8, 2025 It's possible that this reveal is tied to some non-gaming multimedia project, like maybe the upcoming Prime Video series, but I'm inclined to believe it's going to be our first look at the new Tomb Raider game Crystal Dynamics first announced way back in 2022. You don't tease "future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises" without knowing that fans are going to expect a video game reveal. The most telling bit is the new-look Lara. As far back as 2021, Crystal Dynamics was talking about its intent to "unify" the old-school Tomb Raider timeline with the modern Survivor trilogy, and we've occasionally seen new versions of the character blending '90s camp costuming with a more realistic appearance for the character herself. The idea of a "unified" Lara Croft design has grown powerful in the minds of fans, and this new teaser certainly seems to suggest something along those lines. For now, we have only two concrete bits of information on the new Tomb Raider game: it's being developed in Unreal Engine 5, and it's going to be published by Amazon Games. For a couple of years now, it's seemed that Crystal Dynamics only emerges from its silence to announce another round of layoffs before going quiet once again. Here's hoping this reveal at The Game Awards turns out to be a little more unequivocally positive. These are the best Tomb Raider games ever made.

Title: Retail job cuts up nearly 140% from last year

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In the first 11 months of the year, the industry has recorded nearly 92,000 job cuts, with over 3,200 in November alone, according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas. While announced job cuts in the retail industry grew from October, across all industries job cuts were down more than 50% from last month. “Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008.” Some of retail’s biggest companies have announced significant layoffs in recent months. Target announced in October it would lay off 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles, representing about 8% of the retailer’s global headquarters workforce. That same month, Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 roles in an effort to stay “nimble.” Yankee Candle this month said it would lay off 900 people, about 10% of its global professional and clerical staff. The sector’s early holiday performance, however, may make way for additional hires before the year is over, Challenger said. “The increased spending over the Black Friday and the Thanksgiving weekend may give rise to hires in December right before the holiday,” Challenger said. “It’s unclear, however, if those positions will last into the New Year.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts The adorable tiny monster that’s taken over social media feeds speaks to a larger phenomenon of the need for trending trinkets.

Title: Netflix And Paramount’s Hostile Bid For Warner Bros.: What’s Up Next

ByHoward Homonoff, Contributor. The crowning of Netflix as the new King of Hollywood after the Warner Bros. Discovery sweepstakes might be premature as Paramount Skydance has now launched its own hostile takeover bid. This massive game of media’s wheel of fortune is far from over, and it has created a cupboard full of industry stakeholders the size of Musso and Frank Grill, all of whom need to be pondering their next move. Uncertainty and even unbridled fear abound. Whether Netflix’s $82.7 billion deal for WBD is approved, or Paramount emerges the ultimate victor in its $100 billion hostile proffer, the expected fallout will be enormous for industry CEOs, dealmakers, unions, creative talent and consumers. Individually and collectively, the position of the industry reminds me of a twist on the famous line uttered by Robert Redford, as Senator-Elect Bill McKay, at the end of The Candidate: “What do we do now?” I was frankly amused by the statement from Netflix after announcing the WBD deal that it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.’ current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” Netflix has at every stage of its assault on traditional Hollywood looked out for itself first and foremost as a streaming platform – as would any publicly traded company. But remember the business philosophy espoused by Netflix founder Reed Hastings? It’s there in his book title: No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention. Its whole business model is about getting you to spend your time on Netflix. Is this the company to trust in preserving a more than 100-year-old form of content distribution it has systematically helped dismantle? As to commitments like this attached to merger agreements, the business landscape is littered with examples of “but I never thought they’d do that” in the aftermath of transformative deals. I was an executive at one of the pioneers of the cable business, Continental Cablevision, which sold to the then-Baby Bell U.S. West with an expectation that its longtime corporate headquarters would remain in Boston. The ink wasn’t dry on the purchase and sale when that promise came undone. And as detailed in now-former WBD board member John Malone’s business memoir, Born to be Wired, there is a telling example of Ted Turner’s sale of his company to Time Warner. He expected the company to hold to its contractual obligation to keep him running his networks such as CNN and TNT. But the company pushed aside the industry legend Turner, and he never regained his level of power and influence in the industry. I don’t have all the answers to saving the theatrical business, but I wouldn’t expect Netflix – or Paramount Skydance for that matter - to contribute greatly to its sustainability. Maybe a thought instead about the impact of $20 ticket prices and $18 popcorn as a contributing factor to audiences staying away? Just some food for thought. Paramount Skydance is hardly a Hollywood darling, given the cancelation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the steady stream of layoffs and the upheaval at CBS News. Many in the media business assumed not long ago that they would be gearing up to oppose David and Larry Ellison taking control of the hallowed WBD properties, including CNN (which Netflix is not purchasing in its deal). But are they Hollywood’s last chance against Big Tech? The Ellisons already weighed in before the Netflix deal was announced, firing off a letter to the WBD board claiming that the process was “tilted” in Netflix’s favor and such a deal would pose “substantial risks” to the future of the theatrical business. And now, of course, comes word of their own offer to purchase. The political chessboard has been dramatically overturned now, and a new regulatory scramble will ensue. Is Comcast getting back in the game? Does Hollywood now align with the Ellisons to oppose the Netflix deal? Talk about strange bedfellows. Paramount Skydance claims that a deal with Netflix “exposes WBD shareholders to a protracted multi-jurisdictional regulatory clearance process with an uncertain outcome along with a complex and volatile mix of equity and cash.” But the Paramount offer includes financing from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Will there be a regulatory appetite to approve these countries with a significant financial stake in CNN? Does the Trump Administration side with a Silicon Valley-based company not run by Mark Zuckerberg? Does the presence of these sovereign wealth funds help rather than hurt the Paramount bid in the eyes of an Administration whose main negotiator on Middle East peace includes Trump’s deal-making son-in-law Jared Kushner? Putting aside the personal peccadillos in action, where does the Trump Administration come out on the legal analysis of what is in the public interest, including antitrust law? Paramount winning means the consolidation of two of the handful of remaining Hollywood studios, which Netflix does not. But Netflix and HBO Max in combination creates an even bigger streaming colossus. There might be more of a chance of winning Powerball than predicting the final outcome of any Trump Administration action here. Once a process has blown up so dramatically, you wonder if other bidders come out of the woodwork. Does Amazon or Google try to get in on the action here? Sony had previously been working with Apollo Global Management to make a bid for Paramount. Apollo is now teamed up with Paramount, but would Sony try to find another way in as a partner in a WBD deal? If international players are welcomed, is Samsung a partner for someone? Comcast is the most obvious jilted suitor here, seemingly third in a two-team race between Netflix and Paramount. It doesn’t appear to have the financial heft on its own for this transaction. And it doesn’t have a lot of great options. Comcast’s Brian Roberts is hardly a favored figure in the Trump Administration. The company is unlikely to get the law changed to permit it to own two broadcast networks, so a combination of NBCUniversal with Fox or Disney’s ABC doesn’t work today. Sure, it could get Lionsgate – but does that get any shareholders excited? Comcast already decided to spin off its cable networks with Versant so getting bigger in cable is out. Would Comcast set its sights on a different type of “bundling” – maybe a Spotify deal to open up an entirely different world of data and customer engagement? Lots of potential roads, and no idea yet which one Comcast will choose. For Disney, any decision-making has to bring into consideration who will be its next CEO when – OK, if – Bob Iger steps aside as now planned. Maybe its first moves involve some restructuring of its own whether that involves an independent sports business with ESPN or the jettisoning of its stable of other cable networks? The one prerequisite for everyone in media right now is being open to new possibilities from potential strategic and financial partners to untested operating models. Nostalgia in Hollywood is clearly the lowest coin in the realm - industry leaders have got to be looking at shaping their own futures before they present is unrecognizable.

Title: AI Might Be Coming for Your Job. There’s a Proven Way to Prevent That.

More middle-age and older Americans are becoming entrepreneurs and seizing control of their careers. The leap can be stressful but ultimately rewarding—just listen to the people who’ve already done it. If the rise of artificial intelligence has you feeling anxious about your professional future, you’re not alone. It seems that every day there’s another article painting a doomsday scenario for the white-collar, professional worker, whose job will be transformed or eliminated in this career apocalypse. A recent Wall Street Journal story made this loud and clear with the headline “Walmart CEO Issues Wake-Up Call: AI Is Going to Change Literally Every Job.” The story’s message: AI will wipe out some jobs and reshape the company’s workforce. The article included a quote from Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who said the firm is “exiting” employees who can’t be retrained for the AI age. Meanwhile, Accenture will continue to hire people who are fluent in generative AI and retrain existing workers to serve clients in consulting and other divisions. It strikes me that the veiled reference to exiting employees meant those over the age of 50. It gave me déjà vu of when business leaders said the same thing at the dawn of the digital age. It’s ironic that many of the C-suite leaders making such proclamations are themselves older than 50 and have no real tangible experience with AI. During the digital shift, the rush to hire “digiterati” 20-somethings kicked in at full gear. Ultimately, businesses learned younger employees weren’t the cure-all for their digital strategies, as more seasoned employees with years of experience figured out how to evolve business models into the digital age. As a publishing executive who had to navigate the print-to-digital transformation, I was easily “retrained” in my 50s, as were many of my colleagues. As for the companies hiring people who are supposedly fluent in AI, it’s too early in the artificial-intelligence game. No one of any age has accumulated enough knowledge or experience to be true AI natives. But I’m putting my money on older employees who helped navigate the digital age and ultimately became experts. For people in their 50s, corporate careers can be treacherous waters, complete with “downsizing” and “rightsizing,” reorganizations, budget cuts, divisional closures, mergers and acquisitions, the cost of senior talent, and the antiquated idea of mandatory retirement that still exists in certain professions. Now add the glaring headlines that companies like Target, Amazon, Salesforce, IBM, and others are announcing layoffs, many due to the integration of AI into their businesses, resulting in what they say is the need for fewer employees. In other words, the corporate waters seem more treacherous than ever—but there is a proven way to take control of your career before someone else does it for you. If you are in mid-career, now may be the time to rethink your future. It might also be the moment to embrace your inner entrepreneur. According to a 2019 study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, nearly 25 percent of new entrepreneurs were between 55 and 64, almost double from 20 years prior. A 2018 research report from Pierre Azoulay, Ph.D., a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, found that the average age of a successful start-up founder is 45 and that a 50-year-old founder is 1.8 times as likely to have a hit company as people in other age groups. It makes sense. By 50, you’ve likely amassed expertise, industry knowledge, meaningful contacts, and either your own financial resources or access to investment dollars based on your background. There’s not only a growing body of research on midlife entrepreneurialism but also books and real-life examples to serve as a road map. Kerry Hannon, for instance, is an entrepreneur focused on career and retirement strategies; she’s also a speaker and author of several books for those at midlife thinking of making a change. Her book Never Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life is a meaningful playbook, as is Lynne Beverly Strang’s Late-Blooming Entrepreneurs: Eight Principles for Starting a Business After Age 40. A key lesson from these experts is to have a well-thought-out idea that may be an extension of what you’ve done for a living, a new dimension to your background, or an entirely fresh entrepreneurial idea. Matthew Grzybowski, a Polish-born American with a master’s degree in international business who spent nearly two decades in consulting and working for a wealthy European family office, is a prime example of the midlife entrepreneur spirit. When his wife, Veronica, took a sabbatical from her job as a Polish-Korean translator and discovered her love of dog training, it sparked an idea for both of them. As residents of Southampton, New York, they saw a need for a holistic approach to dog care that included daycare, boarding, training, and the requisite spa with bath, blow-dry, brush, and haircut. All their guests get individual walks and playtime, as they relax in the 17 cabanas for the pups. After two years of planning and the decision to self-fund, Southampton Dog opened in late 2024. The business is already profitable, according to the owners. “It’s a place where dogs learn and people connect,” explained Grzybowski, who's pictured at the top of this story. “We have local firefighters and front-page celebrities who are our clients, and we all bond over the dogs.” The cheery 10,000-square-foot facility is the first of what Matthew and Veronica hope will expand to at least three more locations in the next few years. My friend Steve is another excellent example of an entrepreneur in the making. After earning his M.B.A. at UCLA, he worked in entertainment, media, and data-analytics companies. At the age of 51, he was laid off when his company went through yet another reorganization. Ironically, his last assignment was building an AI-strategy road map for his division. At 52, Steve decided he was done with the corporate world, but he still had years of work ahead of him and decided to take the entrepreneurial path. He signed up for the eight-week MIT online course “Leadership in the AI Age: Driving digital transformation for competitive advantage.” His goal is to lean into his years of business experience, adding his new AI knowledge into a practice that advises C-suite executives on ways to adopt AI into their companies, including retraining all their employees, regardless of their age. These stories help to animate a major trend in America, where 21 percent of the population is over 55. According to SCORE, a resource partner of the Small Business Administration, 50.9 percent of small businesses are owned by this group. John Melia, the founder and executive director of the Wounded Warrior Project, who also had a long career in both the nonprofit and for-profit space, became an entrepreneur in his late 50s, launching Contender Equipment Rentals, a veteran-owned construction-equipment-rental company in Texas. “I felt called to build something new from the ground up,” he said. “The idea came from my time in the oil and gas company, where I worked in telematics and sold to rental companies. I realized I had the mindset, the drive, and the operational understanding to start a company of my own.” His advice to anyone over 50 thinking of launching a business is to do it—but do it wisely. Life experience, emotional intelligence, and a strong filter for what matters are important ingredients for success, according to Melia. As life expectancies grow, the idea of retiring at 65 is becoming an outdated concept. If you are that age and healthy, you may live another 30 years. It’s the perfect time to realize that entrepreneurialism has no real age limitations. Luciano Bernardini de Pace had a long career selling advertising in Milan (including for this magazine). In his late 60s, he returned to his hometown in the Puglia region of Italy. There he started an Italian pasta company called Luciano.Market, tapping his media background to spread the word digitally, including videos on YouTube and TikTok. He also restored a palazzo in Bagnolo del Salento, renamed Palazzo Bernardini de Pace, a luxury mansion that he has turned into a boutique hotel. According to Bernardini de Pace, he never really thought about his age. He had an idea that he was passionate about and took the risk. For David Harrison, it was his age that led him to entrepreneurism. As a United Airlines international first officer pilot on the 787 Dreamliner, he is required to retire at 65. His entrepreneurial leap has been to go back to school to earn a master’s degree in wealth management at Columbia University’s School for Professional Studies. It’s a 16-month asynchronous program with two residencies, ideal for his globe-trotting schedule. His pivot will be to support his community, family, and friends as a wealth advisor. “I want to be able to help people achieve their life goals, not just their financial goals,” he said. According to the Wall Street Journal story “The New Age of Entrepreneurship: 70 to 79,” the entrepreneurial urge doesn’t necessarily diminish with age. The article included a profile of 71-year-old Judson Vaughn, who partnered with a 77-year-old to create online courses to teach lawyers how to be entertaining as well as effective. Alan Patricof is perhaps the ultimate role model for a late-in-life renaissance. A seasoned Wall Street executive and investor philanthropist, he has been a serial entrepreneur his whole adult life. In his early 80s, he founded Primetime Partners with Abby Levy. In his mid-80s, he became a first-time author, writing No Red Light about his career in venture capital and more. At 88, he was the oldest participant in the New York City Marathon in 2022. A year later, he got remarried. Becoming an entrepreneur at midlife can be both exhilarating and challenging, but for most who have taken the leap, they often ask, “What took me so long?” If the AI revolution is coming after your job, now might be the time to get ahead of it with your own entrepreneurial idea. And yes, you may have to integrate AI into your own business, but there is a big distinction. At least you’ll own your company and never have to worry about that meeting with your boss when you enter the room and the human-resources person is sitting there too.

Title: I was an ambitious Amazon exec who solved my burnout without skipping a beat at work. Here's how.

It was Friday afternoon, and I'd just hit send on my weekly report to Amazon's Retail vice presidents, detailing what the Global Merchandising team I'd created had accomplished that week. I was 38, and the role — which oversaw standards, best practices, and technology for Amazon's 200+ site merchandisers — was the biggest of my life by far, one I'd been thrust into just three months after my arrival in Seattle and at Amazon. I was thrilled (and a bit terrified) by the size of the opportunity, and threw myself into it. Two years in, my team had 18 sizable projects underway. We accomplished so much that documenting our progress in that weekly email took me hours — and yet in two years, I'd rarely received so much as a "thx" in return. "At Amazon, silence from the top means you're doing a good job," a colleague reminded me, with rueful humor. She was right. But the feedback vacuum made it increasingly difficult to know if I was fulfilling my mandate. Was I moving fast enough? Still aligned with their priorities? Anxiety filled the void. I pushed myself and my team harder and took on even more. This is the first installment of Business Insider's five-part series, The Burnout Cure, which examines how people recognize burnout, confront it, and rebuild their lives on the other side. I'd once been someone with passions — yoga, reading, arthouse movies — but all of that had faded. When I did find time for something I enjoyed, I was distracted, worried that I'd miss an urgent email. It felt easier to stay vigilant at all times. As I stared at my email that day, I thought, None of this actually matters — followed by the sense that I had to keep pushing forward anyway. That if I slowed down even a little, my career would collapse. Later in the parking garage, I stared numbly at the car in front of me when it hit me: Is this what burnout feels like? It was. I just hadn't realized it could happen to me. I was a naturally driven person who liked being busy; I thought burnout was for the weak. And at work, it was hard to distinguish between burning out and just keeping up. In school and at other jobs, I'd often wished that other people would think bigger and move faster; now I was surrounded by smart, fun, driven coworkers on that same wavelength. I rarely had a moment of boredom at Amazon, and I loved that. But there was a dark side. Add in scarce resources, time pressure, and our inability to say no — to our bosses, to each other, and to ourselves — it was a recipe for exhaustion. I'd been raised to believe I could do anything if I only tried hard enough. That worked out pretty well when it was roller skating or long division, but it started to work against me by high school. When I earned my first Cs, I saw it as a failure of willpower, not a sign that I had strengths and weaknesses like any other human. I carried that harsh self-judgment through college and grad school and into the working world. My version of self-care was drinking white wine and shopping, which often drained me further. When it dawned on me that I was burned out, I was finally able to face it. And over the next months, without ever saying a word about burnout to my boss or co-workers, I slowly pulled myself back to health. Here's what I did to get there. Shopping is fun, but what I really needed were things like sleep and food. I started reading novels before bed instead of emails. I made a point of eating lunch every day, even if it was at my desk. Occasionally, I snuck out for a short walk around the block. The views and movement left me calmer. I waited for my gentler lifestyle to blow up in my face — all that time working at a frantic pace had convinced me that slowing down would backfire terribly. But nothing happened. It didn't seem like anyone at work even noticed, though my husband and dog did, and I even passed the occasional coworker on a walk outside the building. The stories I'd told myself about being "found out" hadn't been based in reality. I couldn't change Amazon's culture of overwork, but I could dial back some of the work I volunteered for to be helpful and prove my worth. I was someone who'd rarely turned down ad hoc committees or mentorship requests, especially when it could help elevate women. But those "after-school" assignments did little to advance my career. At performance review time, all that really mattered was what I'd done to grow the business. I decided that unless an opportunity offered a clear benefit not just to Amazon but to me —or unless it was important to my boss, whom I trusted — I'd turn it down. I felt like a selfish jerk at first, but once again, the sky didn't fall. People simply moved to the next candidate on the list. When I did say yes, I was more engaged and effective, sitting in hiring loops for teams I was curious about and joining occasional projects to work alongside former colleagues. Fun counts as a benefit, and pleasure helps cure burnout. A day where I laughed a lot, did work that fascinated me, or simply learned something new was a day where I got something instead of just giving. A fear of embarrassment or failure at work meant I was always ready with a fast response to any executive's question, but it also kept me from challenging myself in new ways. To keep stakes low, I began looking for modest challenges outside work that I could squeeze into small pockets of time, like learning to solve British-style crosswords or making a soufflé. Later, I added Italian lessons, trained for a half-marathon, and joined the board of a local nonprofit serving prison inmates. My "electives," as I thought of them, became a safe place to make and learn from rookie errors, reminding me that being a beginner is exhilarating — and that I was more than just my job. I found a therapist who specialized in cognitive behavioral therapy who showed me how to distinguish between passing thoughts and objective reality. When I thought, "If I say no to this project, someone will think I'm lazy," I learned to ask questions: Did I have evidence of that happening in the past? How about evidence of saying no and still being respected? If someone did think I was lazy, how might I cope? What would I say to a friend with the same worry? I still experienced panicky feelings, but I stopped mistaking them for facts. My comeback from burnout was imperfect and sometimes halting. At times, it scared me to feel calm and well, so I'd dive back into frantic overwork — only to learn all over again that I wasn't more effective that way, just busier. I never worked up the courage to talk to my managers or peers about burnout, even though signs of it were everywhere. In a culture where exhaustion and overwork were worn as badges of honor, I feared that even broaching the topic would mark me as lazy or weak. As a leader, I wish I'd had the courage to push for a broader dialogue about burnout, but I also understand why it didn't feel safe. In an era of mass layoffs, I hear from tech workers who feel pushed to work harder and longer than ever before to avoid losing their jobs. They know they need to pull back, but they're afraid. I have two pieces of advice for people in that situation. The first is to recognize that pushing through burnout won't make you better at your job. The numb, frightened, sleepless version of you can't fire on all cylinders, which could put your job at risk. Prioritizing your own basic needs can be scary, but it's critical. Second, understand that small steps matter. Maybe you're not in a position to turn down extra assignments; maybe the thought of adding an Italian class or half-marathon to your life makes you laugh hysterically to keep from crying. But you can make sure to eat lunch. You can carve out a three-minute breathing space to calm your nervous system. (No one can find you in a restroom stall.) You can run modest experiments, like closing your email after a certain time in the evening, just to see how it goes. Pick something to try, and once it becomes a habit, add something else. The benefits will slowly accumulate, and you'll begin to recognize yourself again. Amazon did not provide a comment for this story. Kristi Coulter spent 12 years at Amazon and left in 2018.

Title: Sony PS5 beats Nintendo Switch 2 to become the best-selling gaming console during Black Friday 2025

Black Friday 2025, while marred by unfortunate events like crazy RAM prices, brought us a ton of great tech deals. Gaming laptops, GPUs, smartphones, wireless earbuds, and virtually every other consumer tech category enjoyed some great discounts. This also includes home gaming consoles, where Sony dropped prices of all PlayStation 5 models for Black Friday. It appears that Sony’s strategy of reducing the price of PlayStation 5 consoles worked quite well, as the PS5 was reportedly the best-selling gaming console in the US during Black Friday 2025. According to data collected by Circana, the Sony PS5 accounted for 47% of the total gaming console volume moved during Black Friday 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2 was the second-best-selling console at 24%. What’s more interesting is that the third place was occupied by the Nex Playground. For the uninitiated, the Nex Playground is a motion-controlled, $249.99 gaming console meant for the entire family. The game library of Nex Playground is catered towards all age groups. So, the console primarily appeals to parents who want to buy a kid-safe console without spending a ton of cash. Another interesting, or worrying, observation here is that neither the Xbox Series X nor the cheaper Xbox Series S appears in the top three best-selling consoles on Black Friday. It is becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft doesn’t really care about the Xbox hardware, as the Xbox console business is in a pretty sad state. We’ve seen repeated price bumps, the closing down of studios like The Initiative, cancellation of in-development games, and mass layoffs. While the company has confirmed that there will be next-gen AMD-powered Xbox consoles, the current state of Xbox doesn’t inspire much confidence in the brand’s future.

Title: Todd Howard says AI is only a ‘tool,’ emphasizes human creativity as Bethesda avoids AI-generated game content

The creative force behind Bethesda Game Studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, Todd Howard, delved into the questionable role of artificial intelligence in game development. The studio director framed it as an invaluable tool while also emphasizing the need for human creativity. Todd Howard discussed this at a promotional event for the second season of Amazon’s Fallout adaptation, which is scheduled to premiere later this month. Howard spoke to Eurogamer’s social producer Mat Jones about the show's expansion into new settings and references to New Vegas. During the conversation, the interview pivoted to AI. Todd Howard said: I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.” He clarified in the interview that Bethesda isn’t using AI as a means for content generation but to streamline internal workflows. Todd looked back and drew a parallel between Photoshop and AI. He said, “I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn’t want to go back to that version of Photoshop.” He believes that AI allows developers to improve efficiency in development processes without compromising on creativity. He further elaborated: But I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. Howard’s comments about AI come at a turning point in the gaming industry, where many developers have sought to use AI to boost profitability, but this has led to widespread layoffs. To put things into perspective, a Google Cloud survey conducted in August 2025 found that 90% of game developers are already using AI in their workflows to automate repetitive tasks and cut costs. 95% of developers using AI stated that AI reduces the monotony of repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of video games. A staggering 94% expect AI to reduce the overall cost of developing games in the long run. Howard concluded the interview, stating, “That’s our view on it. We want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.” Buy the Fallout: Season One Amazon Exclusive Steelbook bundle on Amazon Eurogamer

Title: Media Buying Briefing: Overheard at DPMS — How agencies grapple with AI in programmatic

This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It can sometimes be a fine line between a promise and a threat — but that’s where generative AI stands in its application to the media agency world today. At least that’s the biggest takeaway from a Town Hall discussion at last week’s Programmatic Marketing Summit, held in New Orleans as the last of Digiday’s events for the year 2025. Held under Chatham House rules, which provide anonymity and the freedom to speak freely for the media agency people attending, the Town Hall conversation highlighted the confusion and complexity surrounding the intersection of programmatic advertising and agentic AI. There were differing opinions over to what extent AI and agentic technologies are already part of programmatic workflows (and there seemed to be no consensus definition for what qualifies as agentic). What the agency executives did seem to agree on, though, was that AI agents are best kept away from the actual point of transaction between media buyers and sellers. Instead they should be relegated to pre- and post-transaction tasks, like helping to plan campaign parameters and to organize post-campaign performance data. But even that level of AI involvement will require enhanced training of agency employees not just on AI tools (and their limitations) but also on the fundamentals of programmatic advertising workflows for the human employees to better supervise their AI counterparts. The following has been edited for space and clarity. Setting the stage “I think we all know that machine learning AI … from a buying standpoint is already very integrated. But I think what is new is the gen AI, right? And that’s what’s exciting. The agent idea, and this idea of ideation creating autonomy is where it’s evolving. But I don’t think we all know what we’re talking about, just because it is already integrated within buying across Meta, Google, etc. But from a gen AI aspect, I think that’s what’s really exciting. Where we’ve seen efficiencies in terms of our AI that we’re using is helping with media mix models planning. That really helps with efficiencies, as well as automation in general, in terms of administrative tasks, analytics, and aggregating data.” AI used as a smoke screen “Every agency has some level of machine learning being used in their algorithms and optimizations. We’re not afraid of that, but it isn’t very transparent by nature. One of the challenges we face in this industry is now we’re being fed AI as a cover for more opaqueness in pricing, more opaqueness in performance optimizations. Whether it’s [The Trade Desk’s] Kokai’s new algorithms all trying to do stuff for you and saying ‘Just trust us.’ That, I think scares us, because we know it’s not LLMs, but we also know they’re using it as a smoke screen, and we’re not all equipped to poke holes in their theories and push back. I think that might be where a lot of the fear is, because we just see more opaqueness and us having less and less control.” “We have not gotten there yet, but one of the things that we’re working on on our agency is, how do we use the agentic AI to help us explain what AI is doing in our campaigns? But how do we get it to explain stuff? Because if a person makes an optimization, you can say, Why did you make that optimization? What do you think it was going to do? And what did it do? AI doesn’t do that — it just makes the optimization and has a result or doesn’t have a result.” Careful with that agent, Eugene “Agents are built for fetching and gathering. That’s what they do good. They don’t think. You just asked why — they don’t do that. They’re all probabilistic anyway. Technically agents are [Las] Vegas on all the things you’re looking to track, and it tries to get to a better result based on what it’s seen in the past. So if you’re doing something new right now with the agent, don’t do that. They’re not really good at that yet, because they’re working on odds. I feel like we’re probably three or four years away from trusting any of these things.” “AI can be really good for things with defined parameters. But as an industry, we’re kind of lumping in a lot of AI together. For, say, a programmatic media plan, it’s going to potentially hallucinate because things like outdated information aren’t being taken down from the web, and it’s taking that into consideration. If you just let it to its own devices, you’re not going to get best results. But if you use a very clean data set to find parameters of how things should be evaluated, I think it can be very beneficial.” What’s to come? “From the strategist side, some of the programmatic partners actually have tools that will build your whole media plan, right? But what I haven’t seen is the integration being there. I think their dream of it is, click the one button that builds the plan for you and optimizes the plan. I don’t think that’s upon us yet, but I think that’s what may be coming for us.” “All of us are being told that’s what people want — let’s do that. But then you have legal compliance, and your finance team. All it takes is for the AI to hallucinate one zero, and you’re in big trouble. And that’s one mistake that’s going to cost you potentially a client, or could cost you your job. Because LLMs will never NOT hallucinate — their underlying architecture design has that flaw. I don’t know how many trillions of dollars have been invested in this, but they haven’t fixed this problem. They’re like a very smart intern — we’re going to give it information. It’s going to be able to do a lot of tasks that are menial and take a lot of time, and do it fast. But before we do action, we’re going to put it through some of the older models, or sometimes trust the older models to do the actual heavy lifting, because they have experience. We know they work, and we know they can work and they can do it better.” “You were saying smart intern — it’s a six year old. Think of it as your six year old child who will give you an answer whether it’s right or not, because they want to prove to you that they think what you said is important. That’s AI right now. It’ll be different later, but right now, it’s a six year old.” “We’re using AI in pre- and in post-production. Your whole planning team is pre-production. Your analytics team is post production, giving reports back. That is a lot of the day to day job, so that can save us a ton of time. The actual production part is actually a small percentage of our time. We set up the campaign, we run it, the optimizations come from post analytics, and then we go and make the changes. A lot of the lead up is a lot of time that AI can save us.” Accountability “Accountability comes with management not allowing people to use, ‘Well, that’s what the AI gave me’ as an excuse. They have to be accountable to their work no matter how it’s been generated. And I think that’s how we have to move forward. Because if we allow everyone to use that as an excuse, that we’re going tons of errors.” “My concern is on [the 25-year-old media planner’s] over-reliance on AI for doing a lot of these things. Is that going to impact overall foundational knowledge that allows them to make these strategic decisions creatively and out of the box? Because they’ve been brought up [thinking] ‘Well, I can just do all of these things by throwing it in here.’ They don’t understand the why behind it, and then it snowballs 20 years from now.” How to train your AI “How would you train the AI better? The best way I can describe it is, it’s like good barbecue — low and slow. Use older data that’s very specific. It probably comes in slower than what you’re getting from signal-based data, or real-time data and all the rest of that. Not necessarily because it’s better, but because it has less garbage in it.” Does the need to market as aggressively as possible during the holidays offer an opportunity for retail media networks and challenger social platforms to capture more holiday and 2026 ad dollars? The answer is yes — if they can close the measurement and trust gap, according to new research from Kantar. Some supporting stats: “This merger is a reminder that scale doesn’t fix fragmentation. AI only works when the underlying customer data is unified, governed, and understood. The organizations that win in the next phase of marketing won’t be the ones with the most tools — they’ll be the ones with the clearest picture of their customers.” Programmatic mix will broaden, while AI investment will both drive ad investment and steal focus from other marketing priorities. Media buyers report mixed results with the AI-powered search ads toolset. It functions as a real-time, AI-powered assistant directly within the user’s web browser, overlaying and interacting with existing ad platforms that media agencies use.
