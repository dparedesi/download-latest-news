Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Still unsure how to get the most out of AI? We asked AI leaders at top consulting firms how they use the tech, including the prompts they find most beneficial. On the agenda today: How severed undersea cables could be a big problem for the global financial system. But first: Meet the people shaking up the government. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Elon Musk has been questioning — and dismantling — the workings of the United States of America Inc. Who is helping him with the job? This past weekend, one of our reporters saw a list of people tapped for Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including four whose names had been previously unreported. Our reporters set out to learn more. Who was seen as qualified to help execute this historic and controversial undertaking? On Tuesday, we published our findings. Of the approximately 30 people on the list, most are early-career professionals in their 20s and 30s. They have backgrounds in tech, finance, law, and politics. They include software developers, former Supreme Court clerks, and a former McKinsey consultant. Read the full story here, which offers an exclusive look at the people executing Musk's overhaul of the federal government. The changes are also having an immediate impact on people who work for the federal government. This past week, BI got first-hand accounts of the abrupt firings of some probationary workers at the Small Business Administration and Office of Personnel Management. Thousands of probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were also fired. We are helping our readers keep track of DOGE-induced changes broadly, including this roundup. Some people are excited about what DOGE is doing. Others are horrified. Many feel a bit of both. Whatever your view, our job is to bring you the facts. We're staying on this mammoth story. Please as always, let us know what you think. eic@businessinsider.com. Meta's recent job cuts were part of the social media giant's plans to trim down 5% of its workforce by focusing on the lowest performers. But some terminated employees told BI they were shocked they were being let go given their track record. Internal guidance from Meta's director of people experience — viewed by BI — said managers were allowed to cut higher-performing employees if they couldn't meet their reduction targets. That left some workers who were impacted feeling misrepresented by Meta's stance on layoffs. Now they're worried about how it will impact job prospects. Also read: From his stunt videos to a dozen of his channels dubbed in different languages, MrBeast has attracted an audience of hundreds of millions of viewers by optimizing for YouTube's algorithm. Even after signing a deal with Amazon, the king of YouTube has held on to creative control through a hyperfocused founder-mode ethos. As traditional media companies lose eyeballs to creator-led platforms like YouTube and TikTok, the MrBeast model, as untamed as it is, can offer Hollywood some useful lessons. Take notes, Hollywood. Not everyone wants to be uber-rich. Some heirs are rejecting their fortunes and redistributing them to causes they care about. But the red tape of trust funds can get in the way. One retreat is trying to help by offering its clientele — mostly young, white, queer women — financial advice on how to get rid of their millions and billions. The conference also has workshops that attempt to grapple with the big question: What does it mean to be a "good" rich person? Saying "no thanks" to the family fortune. The backbone of the financial ecosystem isn't on land. Undersea cables, which often aren't thicker than a garden hose, relay $10 trillion in daily transactions and play a major role in transmitting international data. The undersea cable network is vast — and so are its threats. There have been mysterious cases of cable damage that can disrupt financial firms, and some officials are accusing China and Russia. Even islands the size of Taiwan have felt the impact, losing internet access following some cable snaps. Severed cables aren't easy — or cheap — to repair, either. How to mitigate the risk. This week's quote: "When you do robotics right, it allows us to be more human." — Amazon Robotics Chief Technologist Tye Brady talking to Business Insider about the impact robots will have on the human warehouse workforce. More of this week's top reads: YouTube is watched more on TVs than phones. A top exec explains what videos do best on the big screen.

Title: How to avoid being labeled an 'underperformer,' according to the ex-VP of HR at Microsoft
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-avoid-underperformer-label-and-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-16T10:15:48Z

Several companies are laying off people they call "underperformers." Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intuit have all recently done this. The lesson from these layoffs is that simply doing your job well isn't enough. You can toil away for decades doing a fine job and still get caught up in these layoffs. To avoid what seems like a random label, it helps to understand how it happens. On its face, it seems obvious: If a company wants to reduce costs, it makes sense to discard the poorest-performing people. The issue is the haphazard way these evaluations are often done. Dozens of long-term employees from Meta, Microsoft, and others have taken to social media to share their shock. They tell of 10, 20, or even 30-year careers with unbroken strings of excellent reviews, only to get one surprise terrible review followed promptly by a layoff. No one would challenge that poor performers — people who can't meet basic metrics and who repeatedly fall short despite warnings — are candidates for dismissal. That's exactly why companies use this label. Widespread news of a layoff brands the company as in distress. Companies know that potential candidates for their thousands of open positions would avoid joining a company that just did a layoff. On the other hand, branding a layoff as culling the poor performers looks great. The company is removing dead wood, holding higher standards, and striving to be the best. Rather than looking in distress, it looks aggressive and healthy. High-performance people will seek out companies like this. In addition, terminating people for performance helps avoid a range of potential legal issues. Many notification rules don't apply when performance is the justification. A company can avoid or minimize severance obligations when firing for performance, and many of the discrimination laws could be sidestepped as well. If the performance-based layoff hits older or other protected-class workers disproportionately, the excuse could be, "But their performance." These companies already have built-in mechanisms to identify and remove chronic poor performers. Several of them have quota systems that require a certain percentage of their employees to be labeled in the bottom performance tier. Those employees are routinely removed in what is called "unregretted attrition." But then come these layoffs. Managers at all levels are told to identify poor performers and lay them off. They've already done that for years. Now they may have to find more, and that's often done in a cynical and random fashion. "They've been here forever, how about them?" "Nobody likes them, they can go." or "What have they done for me lately?" That's the haphazard way even good people could get branded as underperforming. Managers don't simply stack rank their team and pull the bottom people — that well is dry. What they do is get together with their peers to try to find the layoff candidates among their ranks. They'll discuss individuals and their accomplishments. The worst possible thing that can happen in that meeting is for the group to promptly agree on you. That might be because of very visible mistakes you've made, disagreements you've fomented, or chaos you've caused. Avoiding the label at that point is difficult or impossible. No one around the table will rush to your defense. But it's just as bad if the group says, "Who?" — for them to be unaware of what you've done and the impact you've had. Your manager might defend you, but without support, you're in trouble. Even decades of hitting KPIs cannot insulate you if you're doing it in isolation. The way to avoid this is to make sure you're well known. Fortunately, there are several ways to do that. Volunteer for visible projects. Offer to be the face of the work outside your team. Make that presentation to the VP. Find ways to highlight your work well outside your immediate team. Volunteer to be the liaison between your team and the groups it's dependent on. Raise your hand to participate in those random companywide initiatives that always come up. Stretch your impact by working for different people, in different groups, in very different parts of the organization — even if they're unusual or off your perceived career track. If you can't actually move to other teams, make connections there. Look for ways to connect with your boss's peers and the people who work for them. Find other people well outside your discipline and reach out. Have a coffee or a Zoom and make a connection — any connection. If you do this well, the managers will move on to someone else, and you'll survive this round of layoffs. Unfortunately, once you've received this label, it's often too late. Even if it seems you've been randomly assigned the label, it's hard to shake it off. Work proactively on becoming well known. Find and make connections with people who are likely to be around that table. At all costs, avoid being the "who?" Chris Williams is a former VP of HR at Microsoft.

Title: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to lay off 10% of workforce

Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin told employees Thursday it would lay off about 10% of its workforce.The company has more than 10,000 employees, with a major presence on the Space Coast at its rocket factory adjacent Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex where it constructs its New Glenn rocket. The rocker had a successful debut launch last month.The number of positions that would be affected in Florida was not announced, but it also has major operations in Alabama, Texas and Washington where the company is headquartered.In a letter to employees obtained by the Orlando Sentinel sent by company CEO Dave Limp, he said much of the workforce reduction was due to excessive management built up over the last few years.“Our primary focus in 2025 and beyond is to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness, and efficiency for our customers,” Limp wrote.That would include more buildup of its New Glenn rockets that launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station’s Launch Complex 36, but also its smaller suborbital New Shepard rocket from Texas. The company also designs and will build its new Blue Moon lunar lander at its Brevard County facilities.“We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,” Limp said. “It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities.”He said the layoffs meant eliminating some engineering, research and development, and “thinning out our layers of management.” Limp, a former Amazon executive, took over the CEO role in late 2023. At the time, the company said it had $10 billion in customer orders and more than 10,000 employees.He said affected employees would be notified by Thursday morning while employees being retained would also receive an email confirming their continued employment.Despite the layoffs, Limp said the company would actually continue to hire hundreds of positions to support the programs where it will remain focused.“Let me add that I am extremely confident in the enormous opportunities in front of us and have never been more optimistic about our mission,” he said. “We will be a stronger, faster, and more customer-focused company that consistently meets and exceeds our commitments.”He said 2025 remains bullish with a planned mission to land on the moon with a test version of Blue Moon and flying more New Glenn and New Shepard missions.New Glenn is looking to become certified by Space Force so it can compete for lucrative national security missions. It also has at least 12 launches under contract with Amazon for its Project Kuiper internet satellite constellation — the next targeting this spring.“The impact this has is not lost on any of us — we are saying goodbye to our friends and colleagues who have helped us build Blue into what it is today,” he wrote.The workforce reduction follows news earlier this week that Boeing was preparing for up to 400 layoffs in the event the Space Launch System rocket program tapped to support NASA’s Artemis program could be scrapped.That follows worries the Trump Administration may opt out of using the pricey SLS rocket to accomplish future Artemis missions — but no program changes have been announced.Boeing also announced its intentions in late 2024 to lay off 10% of about 170,000 employees nationwide. That included 141 among its Florida operations, home to where its Starliner spacecraft is manufactured as well as its Space and Launch Division headquarters.

Title: Federal Workers Rise up Against Musk, Trump and Drastic Cuts
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/federal-workers-rise-up-musk-trump-doge
Time Published: 2025-02-14T20:45:00Z

Chris Dols was one of hundreds who flooded to the streets of Washington, D.C. this week to protest the shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was one of the few remnants of the 2008 financial crisis that actually aimed to help ordinary people. The workers locked out of the agency spoke about their jobs, the value of the work they did, reminding themselves and their audience that federal employees have vital jobs that working Americans rely on. Naturally, that’s placed it in the crosshairs of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has so far functioned like a private hit squad, moving in and out of various government offices in what Reuters, based on the analysis of two Republican experts, called ​“an ideological assault on federal agencies long hated by conservatives.” Dols, a founding member of a new network of federal workers organizing to counter the attacks from President Donald Trump and Musk, thought the targeting of CFPB clarified what Musk and Trump’s real agenda is. “[The CFPB] is the protection for consumers against fraud,” he said. ​“The grifters went after the anti-grifting agency.” If Trump and Musk really cared about cutting waste and fraud and improving the lives of working people, he noted, they’d be strengthening and expanding the CFPB’s reach, rather than slashing it. Lauren, a worker with the Bureau of Land Management who did not want to give her last name for fear of being targeted, noted that while Musk is bragging about returning the CFPB’s budget ​“to the taxpayers,” that’s pennies compared to the $21 billion the CFPB has returned to Americans who’d been ripped off by financial institutions since its inception in 2011. “I don’t know if people have already forgotten how devastating that financial crisis was and how many lives it upended,” she said. Dols, Lauren and the other members of the Federal Unionists Network (FUN) have been preparing for Trump’s assault on the public workforce and swung into action in the months since his election. (All of the workers I spoke to for this article provided their job title and union membership for ID purposes only and stressed they are only speaking in a personal capacity, not on behalf of their employer or their union.) Those workers are engineers like Dols — who works at the Army Corps of Engineers as a dredging expert and is president of Local 98 of International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) — but also healthcare providers, legal experts, and other professionals who, together, make up a federal workforce of more than two million now under threat of removal by an administration bent on wreaking havoc on the very idea that government can improve the lives of its citizens. They’ve called for a day of action on February 19, and more broadly, for federal workers and anyone who wants to save public services to step up and learn to organize. “We have a ton to learn from all the people who are going to come in,” Dols said. ​“Everybody needs to become an organizer right now.” In addition to opposing DOGE’s roving hits, the FUN has focused on Trump’s offer to buy out federal workers. The offer has Musk’s fingerprints all over it — the email making the original buyout offer was titled ​“Fork in the Road,” the same title Musk used in a similar email to Twitter employees when he acquired the social networking site — and a number of unions have filed multiple lawsuits against the buyout. But a judge removed a freeze placed on the offer while the lawsuits proceeded on Wednesday, at least temporarily allowing it to go forward. (In These Times reached out to Musk Friday with questions about this article and have not yet received a response.) Whether it is legally halted or not, Dols pointed out, the buyout has fallen short of the administration’s hopes. Something like 3% of the workforce has reportedly accepted the buyout — as Dols noted, in a given year, the turnover due to retirement or normal resignation is closer to 5%. ​“Federal workers obviously don’t trust it, they feel this is an attack. This is a scam.” The court’s decision to let the buyout proceed, he said, ​“should show us that it’s going to be up to organized labor to wage the fight and not to trust the courts.” “They know they’re creating a crisis. It’s intentional,” Dols said. ​“They think they can manage the crisis. They wouldn’t create it if they didn’t think they could manage it. Our job is to make it unmanageable.” “Many of these things that we’re seeing from this administration are designed to strike fear into people,” Colin Smalley, also with the Army Corps of Engineers and president of Local 777 of IFPTE, told me. ​“And a lot of folks out there have been building community in anticipation of this. They’ve been building a place to turn to, whether that’s organized labor or whether it’s the folks that you do a community garden with or your church or whatever it is that you can turn to be with other people and accomplish something together. To me, that’s the work that beats this division and chaos.” Smalley, like Dols, began organizing federal workers within and beyond his union a few years ago, and the two of them ran on a joint ticket for IFPTE leadership in 2024, highlighting the danger that a potential Trump victory posed to the federal workforce. While the Trump/​Musk chaos is unprecedented in recent history, he said, their tactics are recognizable: ​“They use some of the same tactics as traditional union busting tactics in the private sector, that these so-called union avoidance firms preach,” he said. ​“One of the reasons we knew it was going to be bad is because things have been getting bad before January 20. They were getting bad before November. Things have been getting bad for working people for a long time.” Being prepared for a Trump return was a form of inoculation, Dols added. ​“You talk about what might happen so that people are prepared for it so that when they actually encounter it, it’s not the first time that it’s happening to them, and it’s not totally disorienting.” The network now known as FUN grew out of a campaign to confirm former President Joe Biden’s nominees to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA, the agency which manages labor relations for the federal workforce), and evolved into a grassroots rank-and-file network across unions and agencies across the country. Mark Smith, an occupational therapist and health educator with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in San Francisco, as well as president of National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1, explained, ​“We really wanted a way to connect with each other and learn from each other and build a bit more of a fighting labor movement in the federal sector, to defend the public sector and public services more broadly from just the 40 year assault on public services in this country.” The challenge for organized labor in this moment, Dols said, is to move away from a mobilization strategy — bring people to a rally, wave some placards, and go home — to ​“an actual mass participation organizing model.” That means building, day by day, bigger, stronger unions, adding new members and training the ones that exist. ​“We need orders of magnitude more people learning how to take action and organize action and compel their coworkers into action. That’s the only way we’re going to have the forces in place that can win these arguments, let alone win elections.” Part of their strategy, he added, is being willing to challenge the Democrats on their failures — something that much of the labor movement has been unwilling to do, and if it has, it’s often been to cozy up to Trump instead. Those early campaigns didn’t succeed — those Biden nominees were never, in fact, confirmed, nor did Dols and Smalley win national leadership — but each attempt brought in new members and taught them more about what federal workers wanted and needed. The network now known as the FUN was small, compared to the massive federal workforce, but it was in the right place when Trump was announced the winner in November, and ready to fight. “People were looking for where to go to resist what was coming,” Dols said. ​“We’re in the middle of this massive growth spurt.” Their upcoming day of action on February 19 is in some ways a structure test, to see the breadth of that growth in action. Under the slogan ​“SOS, Save Our Services,” they are at once making a distress call to the broader public, and providing a visible pole of attraction for people to join. That call has already been working — ​“The federal workforce is awakening,” Smith said — as workers rush to join the various federal unions. (The entire federal sector is open shop, meaning workers don’t have to be members of the union to receive the benefits of its collective bargaining.) “I’ve had more people sign up for the union in the last week than in six months previously. As we say in the labor movement” Smith said, ​“a bad boss is the best organizer.” To Smalley, it’s important to show the country the real work that federal employees do, to counter Musk’s railing about ​“unelected” bureaucracy. ​“The Right now loves to call us unelected bureaucrats. The idea is that these unelected bureaucrats are somehow making decisions that are unaccountable to the public when the reality couldn’t be further from the truth for most federal workers.” (Musk, of course, was also not elected by anyone.) Many people, those who may have voted for Trump and believed in his promises to cut government waste, but also those who broadly oppose his policies, don’t really know what the federal workforce looks like, where it’s located, or the variety of jobs it contains. But federal workers are all over the country, in every community, in cities and on rural lands. The government, Smalley said, ​“looks like books in our libraries. It looks like trees in our parks. It looks like people getting the healthcare that they need, and folks that have contributed to their communities for a full life aren’t destitute and suffering on the street. These guys are trying to take a torch to the entire concept that we should care about each other as humans.” Lauren, for instance, works for the Department of the Interior in New Mexico. ​“The majority of the American public does not even know about the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), what we do and the extent to which we operate,” she said. ​“It is a huge contribution to economic development, but also in terms of what we’re addressing and facing with climate change, environmental justice, we’re really at that nexus for those issues.” And during the last Trump administration, they brought the hatchet down on BLM headquarters, forcing a relocation to Colorado from D.C., and dispersed others around the country. Many employees left their jobs rather than move, and Trump has pointed to this strategy as something he’d like to replicate this time around. MT Snyder, meanwhile, another FUN member, is a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco. Her day-to-day is conducting union representation elections and investigating unfair labor practice charges for private sector workers. “I drive all over Northern California to any facility where there’s going to be a union election and manually conduct these elections, secret ballot elections using paper ballots and a cardboard box.” She studied labor relations in graduate school and wanted to dedicate her life to supporting workers’ right to organize. This is true of many federal employees, Smith said. ​“This administration has kind of shot itself in the foot multiple times already with the emails they’re sending to two million federal employees saying that you should consider a high productivity job in the private sector and get away from your low productivity job in the public sector,” he said. The physicians and nurses and other healthcare professionals at the VHA, he said, could work anywhere, but chose public service, and telling them that they are ​“low productivity” has only fired them up. Those VHA workers are all over the country: they are psychologists, social workers, speech therapists, chaplains, health scientists, researchers, pharmacists, and doctors and nurses. ​“They come for the mission of serving veterans, and then also avoiding much of the moral injury that I think happens in the private sector where you’re not able to deliver the care that you would want to be able to because people can’t pay or the insurance company doesn’t want to pay.” Beyond the VHA, the union Smith belongs to, the NFFE, represents workers in the forest service, including the kinds of wildland firefighters that have been desperately needed to fight the recent wildfires in Southern California. There are National Park Service workers who might lose their seasonal jobs with Trump’s hiring freeze, park rangers who, Lauren said, ​“are living in trailers because they can’t afford housing in the communities that they serve.” “This idea that we’re overpaid and not doing our jobs and are only located in D.C. is just patently false,” she said. ​“They’re acting like our agencies are overfunded and inefficient, but we’re basically accomplishing our missions on drastically reduced budgets.” The IFPTE, Smalley said, represents workers like him, at the Army Corps of Engineers, who do things like prevent flooding and help with disaster recovery — again, deeply necessary work after this year’s violent storms — and ecosystem restoration. “We represent the scientists and engineers as well as the folks that work on the business end of things with the money and the economists and planners. But we also have equipment mechanics, lock and dam operators, crane operators. There’s a tugboat crew that we represent on the Great Lakes.” And those people, Snyder added, those rank-and-file workers across a wide array of industries, job titles, unions and states, are fighting to keep providing those services — and fighting for the idea of government as something that provides for people at all. “My office is full of attorneys who could double their income by moving to the private sector,” Snyder said. ​“I think that Musk and this administration don’t understand how much public servants care about the work that they do. And we’ll fight to make sure that the public will continue to benefit from our services.” The battle to save public services predates Trump and his alliance with Musk. ​“Outsourcing and privatization has been increasing exponentially for more than a decade, including under both Democrat and Republican appointees,” Smith said. The Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME (2018) made the rest of the public sector open shop, a move that built on decades of demonizing public employees, from teachers to social workers, as greedy leeches draining the pockets of ordinary working people. In 2010, a wave of Republican governors like former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attempted to crush public workers’ unions on the state level, and Trump and Musk are out to do the same on the federal level. That effort has led to some overheated, verging-on-unhinged rhetoric from the Right. Russ Vought, Trump’s choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, has said ​“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” (Not to be outdone, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during his failed presidential campaign that he would ​“start slitting throats” in the federal bureaucracy.) Democrats, meanwhile, rarely succeed in undoing these attacks. ​“When the Democrats are in power, it tends to be that everything is about bipartisanship and compromise. And so rather than making strides forward, we’re making small strides back,” Smalley said. ​“Whereas in Republican administrations, generally we’re getting thrown as far back as they possibly can, and we’re in a defensive mode.” Nearly every worker I spoke with mentioned chronic underfunding at their agencies, chronic pressure to do more with less. The attacks on the federal sector are just the beginning, Lauren noted. ​“They’re not going to stop with us.” The public sector is, after all, still one of the few bastions of good employment — while it pays less than private sector work, the stability, protections, and sense of mission compensate, or at least, they have in the past. “We are the proof to the American working class that there is a better way. You don’t have to be peeing in a bottle in the back of an Amazon van or working 80 hours a week,” Smalley said. ​“Those of us who work in government, a lot of us came specifically for the better working conditions. And the people like Elon Musk are trying to destroy that status quo so that they can gaslight all of America into forgetting that there’s a better way.” If they succeed, there will be a trickle-down effect on the rest of the country, just not the one that Republicans have long promised. Rather than money, it’ll be shoddy working conditions that spread. Trump has already fired members of the NLRB and the FLRA, preventing those authorities from doing their jobs, despite the law stating that those members can only be removed ​“for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause.” Employers can essentially flout the law, secure in the knowledge that the board can’t act to stop them. Despite all the shock and awe, Snyder said, workers are digging in, and her union’s members are more engaged than ever. ​“We’re having emergency meetings, we are coming up with ideas, we’re making our own pins, making our own slogans. Members of my local know that this fight is dire. The stakes are incredibly high.” The incursions by DOGE have been shocking, Smalley noted, and reach well beyond the employees at places like the CFPB. ​“They are attempting to corporatize every square inch of the federal government.” Most notably, DOGE has accessed the Treasury payments system, and databases which contain, according to one Associated Press article, ​“information about individual and business taxes, medical records, Social Security payments and numbers, and government payments, as well as a long list of other personal data, such as birthdates, home addresses and phone numbers, military records and disability information.” The process is chaotic, sloppy, and while the cruelty is, as so many have noted for years, the point, it is also true that it is not a well thought out process. ​“I work in the Department of Defense, and we’ve seen the phrase ​‘national security’ applied at least three different ways,” Smalley said, to exempt and then un-exempt workers from freezes, cuts, buyouts and layoffs. Beyond the cruelty, the economic impact of the massive layoffs that the administration is considering would be massive. The demonization of public sector workers tends to ignore the fact that decently paid public employees do in fact pay taxes, shop in local stores and online, and contribute to the stability of their communities. If they lose jobs en masse, there will be ripple effects in local economies. The fight is, at the end of the day, about the very nature of government, Smalley said. ​“The way that coming together as a community has been organized in this country is through government. Government is not some abstraction, some monolithic thing. It’s people in our community serving each other.” To beat Trump and Musk at their own game, Dols said, the fightback will have to be broader than one union or one sector, even one as massive as the federal sector. “All the unions that are keeping their head down hoping that they don’t come after them [should know] they’re coming after everybody. The sooner you stand up with each other, the better,” he said. ​“You make the argument that this is an attack on the public by the billionaires. So which side are you on?” The February 19 day of action is an opportunity to pick a side, and to demonstrate it. One part of it will be online — the FUN is asking people to post pictures of themselves wearing red, white and blue and describing the services they provide, if they’re a federal worker, or how they benefit from those services if they’re not. They should get together in person, to take photos but also to be seen in public, to invite others to join. They’re also calling in-person rallies, including at Tesla stores all across the country, Snyder said. “This is about showing each other that we can be courageous together,” Smalley said, ​“and that in the face of the attempts to make us afraid and to make us divided and to make us feel hopeless, that we can turn all of those narratives with something as simple as coming together to remind ourselves why we do our jobs, why we come to work, no matter where that work is.” Supporters can join those events, but it’s also important, Smith said, for regular people to be calling their members of Congress — Democrat or Republican — and demand that the attacks on public servants stop. If they’re union members in a different sector, they can call on their union to support the federal workers’ efforts. It is a moment, the workers all stressed, to be building bridges rather than demanding ideological purity. As the effects of Trump’s cuts and attacks are felt, Smalley said, ​“People who have traditionally thought that they didn’t have much in common with working class people, maybe they don’t identify as part of the working class, they’re going to be affected, and they’re going to need that same community that we’re building right now, and we’re going to be here ready to work with them.” At the same time, Dols stressed, it is a moment for political education, for focusing on the billionaires and others who are materially benefiting from Trumpism. “They are rich because we are poor,” he said. ​“And if they want to say let ​‘er rip so that the economy booms, it’s just going to exacerbate all of the contradictions that gave rise to all of the regulations that are in place. The establishment is forgetting that the labor protections enforced by the NLRB, and the regulations that are enforced by various regulatory agencies, were all put in place to stabilize the system because the system is crisis prone.” This requires, again, organizing beyond a few social media snaps and reposts. The Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC) is starting a project focusing on organizing federal workers who don’t already have a union, Dols said, and despite the stifling of the various labor boards, workers can still behave like a union whether or not they’re legally recognized. As for FUN, ​“We’re going to do everything we can to maximize our surface area, create opportunities for people to come in and take ownership over it,” Dols said. They want to build a democratic mass organization out of the network, and to do that, they need to organize a lot of new members. The fight ahead is going to be a marathon, not a sprint — a phrase well beyond cliché at this point, but it’s one worth remembering in this moment. ​“Some of us who are inclined to sprint — and God knows I’m inclined to sprint — have to make sure we’re making strategic choices to scale up in a way that’s sustainable because part of their crisis plan is to burn us out,” Dols continued. “Those of us who are already in the trenches need to pace ourselves in a way that we can survive this long run and in the process, enlist and train as many other people to walk and then to jog and then to run alongside us,” he said. “This isn’t going to be solved by a handful of really clever organizers. It’s going to be solved by an army of organizers mobilizing the broader public to make this crisis unmanageable for ​‘em.” Sarah Jaffe is a writer and reporter living in New Orleans and on the road.

Title: The Gloves Are Off: Amazon’s Quebec Layoffs Spark Backlash

Good e-Reader 14 February 2025 by Angela Waterfield Leave a Comment Amazon’s recent decision to shut down all seven of its Quebec warehouses, laying off more than 1,900 workers, is more than just another round of corporate restructuring—it’s a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between multinational corporations and labor unions. The Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), representing the affected workers, has wasted no time launching legal action, seeking to annul the layoffs, reopen the warehouses, and secure compensation for employees. The timing of Amazon’s move is suspect, coming less than a year after the successful unionization of its DXT4 warehouse in Laval—the first Amazon facility in Canada to achieve this milestone. Amazon insists the closures are part of a “strategic shift” aimed at optimizing its North American delivery model. However, labor advocates see it differently, arguing that the timing suggests retaliation rather than efficiency. An Amazon spokesperson stated, “Our goal is to align operations with evolving market demands,” but did not directly address concerns about union-busting. Amazon has indicated a willingness to discuss the matter with Canadian and Quebec officials but has not signaled any intention to reverse its decision. This lack of transparency is fueling skepticism, particularly among workers who see a pattern reminiscent of past corporate tactics. CSN president Caroline Senneville didn’t mince words in a press conference, calling out Amazon’s reasoning as a smokescreen: They’re not fooling anyone. The only reason for Amazon to have a different business model just for Quebec is that there’s a union here and an arbitrator could have imposed a first collective agreement as early as the summer of 2025.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. In 2005, Walmart shut down a store in Jonquière, Quebec, shortly after workers unionized—a move the courts later ruled was a violation of labor law. Now, history appears to be repeating itself, only this time, Amazon is the corporate heavyweight on the defensive. Beyond the immediate labor dispute, Amazon’s decision has ignited broader political and economic tensions. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne has suggested that the federal government could reevaluate its business relationship with Amazon, including contracts with Amazon Web Services. If that happens, the financial stakes could extend far beyond a few warehouses. Meanwhile, the CSN is upping the ante by urging the public to hit Amazon where it hurts—its bottom line. The union is calling for a boycott, encouraging Canadians to stop shopping on Amazon and cancel their Prime subscriptions. Given the rising anti-American corporate sentiment fueled by U.S.-Canada tensions—most recently exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff threats—this call to action may find a very receptive audience. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent press conference, “Canadians are more united than ever.” At its core, this battle isn’t just about one company or even one industry—it’s about the growing friction between corporate behemoths and the workers who fuel their profits. The pandemic solidified Amazon’s dominance, but it also heightened awareness of the often-precarious conditions for its workforce. Unionization efforts, once seen as nearly impossible in Amazon’s high-turnover, high-pressure environment, are gaining momentum. Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos’ latest public appearance only fuels accusations of his corporate opportunism. Once critical of Donald Trump threat to democracy, Bezos was front and center at Trump’s 2025 inauguration, alongside other tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. His presence signals a stark reversal from his 2016 warnings about “Trump’s authoritarian tendencies” are “eroding our democracy”. Rather than ideological alignment, Bezos’ attendance suggests that his business interests take precedence over past political stances. To be fair, he may have had a genuine change of heart, but for many employees and consumers, his shifting stance only deepens uncertainty about where he truly stands. The outcome of the CSN’s lawsuit remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: This isn’t just a labor dispute—it’s a test case for the power dynamics between multinational corporations, governments, and organized labor in an era of economic turbulence. Amazon may be accustomed to controlling the narrative, but in Quebec, the fight is far from over. An avid book reader and proud library card holder, Angela is new to the world of e-Readers.

Title: Bezos’ Blue Origin Cuts 10% of Jobs to Ramp Up Rocket Launches

Blue Origin is reportedly planning on letting go of approximately 10% of its workforce—about 1,000 employees—nearly a month after the inaugural liftoff of New Glenn. The company is hoping to focus on growth over the next few years, increasing the production and launch cadence of its new giant rocket. In an email sent to employees on Thursday, Blue Origin CEO David Limp announced the layoffs that will affect “positions in engineering, (research and development), and program/project management and thinning out our layers of management,” according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN. After years of delays, Blue Origin finally debuted its New Glenn rocket on January 16. The heavy-lift launch vehicle blasted off from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking the first time a Blue Origin rocket reached orbit (the company’s New Shepard rocket, used for space tourism purposes, is suborbital). New Glenn’s second stage reached its target orbit following a pair of successful burns of the BE-3U engines, while its booster was lost during descent. The company was hoping to carry out a soft landing of the booster on an ocean-based platform, but alas, that didn’t happen. Still, the rocket’s inaugural flight was a major success. During an all-hands call on Thursday, Limp argued that the company’s decision to let go of more than 1,000 employees would help Blue Origin scale the manufacturing of New Glenn and increase its launch cadence, Reuters reported. The rocket could pose some serious competition for SpaceX, further fueling the rivalry between Blue Origin’s founder Jeff Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk. New Glenn is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of lifting 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit. The 313-foot-tall (95-meter) rocket has a reusable first stage, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable, heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying 63 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 26 metric tons to geostationary orbit. SpaceX has been an industry favorite for years, while Bezos’ Blue Origin finally got it together last year under new leadership. The company replaced Bob Smith as CEO, hiring former Amazon executive Limp as his replacement. Blue Origin employees, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that Limp has been tasked with streamlining the company’s business units and pushing for greater focus on New Glenn, providing an overall sense of urgency after years of stagnation. Limp’s push for speed, however, has affected morale and company culture, Blue Origin employees told Reuters. It’s good to see the company making progress on its space ambition, but that, unfortunately, seems to have come at a price. blue originJeff Bezosnew glenn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to Cut 10% of Workforce to Compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX

Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, has announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its employees to streamline operations and improve its competitive position against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The Seattle Times reports that Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp informed employees of the impending layoffs via email, citing the need to reduce bureaucracy and sharpen the company’s focus. The 10 percent cut, which will impact over 1,000 workers across engineering, research and development, and management roles, are part of a broader strategy to scale up manufacturing output and launch frequency. The announcement caught many employees off guard, with some expressing concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the ability to meet ambitious goals with a reduced workforce. Blue Origin, which employs between 11,000 and 14,000 people, including more than 4,000 in Washington state, did not provide a breakdown of how the layoffs would affect its various locations. The move comes on the heels of the successful launch of Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, a milestone that was seen as a step forward in the company’s efforts to catch up with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. However, the company has faced criticism for its slow pace of progress and bloated structure under previous leadership. Limp, who joined Blue Origin in 2023 after leading Amazon’s devices and services division, has sought to bring a more Amazon-like approach to the company, emphasizing efficiency and rapid growth. This shift in culture has been seen as a departure from the “slow and steady” philosophy embodied by the company’s tortoise mascot and Latin motto, “gradatim ferociter” (step by step, ferociously). Despite the layoffs, Limp expressed optimism about Blue Origin’s future, outlining an ambitious agenda for 2025 that includes landing on the Moon, delivering a record number of engines, and establishing a regular launch cadence for its New Glenn and New Shepard rockets. He also noted that the company would continue to hire in areas that support its goals and customer focus. The layoffs at Blue Origin reflect a broader trend in the aerospace industry, as companies grapple with the challenges of scaling up production and achieving profitability in an increasingly competitive market.

Title: Price Hikes, Enshittification Trigger 700K Customer Losses At Disney+, ESPN+

Full Content:
Culture Now that streaming subscriber growth has slowed, we’ve noted repeatedly how the streaming TV sector is falling into all of the bad habits that ultimately doomed traditional cable TV. That has involved chasing pointless “growth of growth’s sake” megamergers and imposing bottomless price hikes and new annoying restrictions (like equating password sharing with “piracy”) — all while simultaneously cutting corners on product quality in a bid to give Wall Street that sweet, impossible, unlimited quarterly growth it demands. Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all now owned by the same company thanks to consolidation) all recently raised prices to access streaming catalogs of deteriorating quality. Some of Disney’s price hikes were as much as 25 percent, hitting ad-based and ad-free versions alike. Customers were quick to complain. So not surprisingly, Disney+ has now seen the first quarterly subscriber loss in the streaming platform’s history, with 700,000 customers cancelling service. ESPN+, ESPN’s streaming service, also saw a 700,000 subscriber loss: “Total paid Disney+ subscriptions currently rest at 124.6 million compared with 125.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter. ESPN+ also saw a loss of 700,000 subscribers, currently at 24.9 million, compared with 25.6 million at the end of last quarter.” Publicly-traded companies can’t just provide a quality, affordable service people like. That’s simply not allowed. They have to provide Wall Street ever-escalating quarterly returns in the pursuit of scale, even if that pursuit proves disastrous. If it’s not possible to achieve those returns through innovation and subscriber growth (which is no longer possible now that the streaming market is saturated), that’s when big companies get in trouble and start creatively nickel-and-diming their user base. Traditional cable TV, of course, went through this exact life cycle. And despite the fact many of those executives have shifted over to streaming, they’ve learned nothing from history or experience because they’re not financially incentivized to learn from experience. They’re incentivized to make stock values climb at any cost, then flee when things get rough; fat executive or investor compensation in hand. Which is to say don’t expect things to change, even if the economy tightens and customers increasingly balk at higher streaming video prices. I’d expect two major trends in streaming over the next few years. One, a significant uptick in pointless, shitty mergers that trigger layoffs, huge debt loads, more price hikes to recoup that debt, and steady product quality erosion (see: the whole AT&T→Time Warner→Discovery mess). Media execs are very excited for the Trump administration to rubber stamp even more problematic consolidation. Two, I suspect companies will work tirelessly to make cancelling streaming services (a major advantage over traditional bloated cable TV) more difficult, whether that means complicated wireless/broadband bundling that makes dumping services a confusing hassle (is your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill?), or some creative new restrictions we haven’t seen previously. Filed Under: disney plus, enshittification, espn plus, price hikes, streaming, television, tv, video Companies: disney In terms of entshittification, Disney has made it even worse: the ad-free subscription tier is no longer a guarantee of avoiding ads. If I didn’t know any better, I would say they’re actively trying to get people to pirate their content. TBF, Disney’s only following Amazon in enshittification. I dunno about that. Changing the terms and conditions just so people can’t sue for false advertising is more shitty to me. It sounds bad, and I haven’t reviewed the specific agreements, but many web site agreements require users to hold them harmless and even indemnify them. In other words, if you sued them, you’d be paying their legal bills and any amount the court awarded you. In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. (I found such a clause in the terms of the payment provider my landlord wanted me to sign up with—a company that wanted access to pull money directly from my bank account while offloading all responsibility for their errors onto me. Needless to say, I complained, and I’m using checks again like it’s the 1980s.) In theory. It’s such an absurd result that it’s hard to believe a court would uphold it; I’m not sure any company’s even tried. My point is, “you can’t sue for false advertising” is actually a much better clause than the usual “you can’t sue for anything ever”. Oh, no worries, Disney covered that as well. People really need to start treating this shit as they’d treat actual contracts. If Disney handed guests a binder of legalese to sign before being let into the park, well, the lawyers would be happy, because their kids would be walking right onto otherwise-deserted rides. But the company would probably have to backtrack pretty quickly, just as Walmart would if they made everyone sign the printed walmart.com agreement and its ancillary policies before entering a store. Somehow, if it’s online, people will be eager to agree to literally almost anything. I find that people sign paper contracts in person that are also onerous and stupid because society has forced them to turn off their brains and has forced them to blow exorbitant amounts of cash they don’t have on things they wouldn’t need if they wern’t structured to force these needs. Then there are also those who sign just cuz they want stuff, which is also frequently a social disease. So, should it be called “endisneyfication”? That was already a thing, but you can roll all the stupid Disney behaviors up in that coinage. [I]s your Hulu subscription discount tied to your Amazon or wireless bill? They almost got me with the last one until I read the fine print. So Disney+ lost 700k customers. On a total of over 150 million subscribers, that’s less than half a percent. I imagine their departure was more than made up for with the price hike for the remaining customers. I guess the beancounters are striving for a balance between raising prices fast enough to appease the stock market and slow enough so less customers bail. Anyway, they’re not in this business for the entertainment value or the service to their customers. Hard to say. Even if they’re making the money back from increasing fees, it doesn’t look good to the shareholders that they lost almost 1.5 million subscribers across two platforms. Especially for the ad-based products. If raising prices results in fewer subscriptions but the total profit is up, I can’t see investors having an issue with that. But if raising prices is impacting ad impressions… THAT has a cascade effect. It’s shocking they have that many subscribers given how Usanians keep complaining they can’t even afford food. Subscribe through a burner credit card. Subscribe through a burner credit card. That’s a better answer than simply no longer paying their monthly bills. But I must confess, how does one obtain a ‘burner’ card… without being totally dishonest about one’s identity in the first place? Credit issuers have their own rules about these kinds of things, let alone the laws regarding fraud, etc. My version of a ‘burner’ is where my debit and credit cards are issued by a credit union. At my union, I have the power to designate a black list of companies no longer permitted to lay charges against my card/account. Wherein I am honest and don’t wait for the service provider to cut me off, I simply stop using the service entirely, on my own. My premise is that if they turn me into collections, they’ll have to provide documentation that I never tried to cancel through their ‘official’ channel(s), and that I did indeed use the service and then failed to pay for it. I’ve told more than one collection outfit to get me those proofs, beyond just a simple billing statement, and for sure, it’s never happened. It’s worked so far. N.B. Note that states may have different laws regarding the necessary proof. What I described is what my state requires, your state may be different. I do know that collectors will try to skate around these laws and brute-force you into paying, but hold your ground. Or at the very least, get educated on what your state allows (or requires) a collector to do. I use virtual credit cards. If they won’t let me unsubscribe then I can just cancel the card. It works because the amounts are too small to take you to court, or for a debt collector to put in much effort. But, technically, you’d be on the hook for fees till you canceled, and we don’t know whether a court would accept a “it was too hard to cancel” defense. Only if they continued to provide you the service during all of that time. While that works for the archetypical impossible to cancel gym membership, that’s because those who wish to stop paying also wish to stop going to the gym. If Disney was actually giving everyone who stopped paying “free” access to Disney+, it would not go well for them. It’s getting very visible in my bubble. Piracy is flourishing again. Of course these companies will point to piracy as the cause of their losses, no the consequence as it actually is. And they’ll extract huge figures incompatible with their actual self-imposed losses and generally taken from their collective arses. could boycotts also be affecting subs? 700k subscribers lost against 125 million overall, with 24 million on ESPN+ alone, means total subscribers went down 3%, which isn’t nothing. It is directly tied to the price increase from $9.99 to $15. It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves, from Reddit and Twitter locking their APIs to Netflix and Disney+ increasing their prices for no good reason. Tesla went from being the cool electric car company to the car people are embarrassed to drive and have to slap bumper stickers on saying they bought it before Elon became a fascist president unelect. Most of Teslas revenue last year was from licensing [https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-crypto-tesla-earnings-stock-elon-musk-trump-accounting-ev-2025-1?op=1](and selling cryptocurrencies), it seems. All that being said, you forgot to call anyone brunchlords, Karl, so this article is bad and you are a monster. I made this account to leave this comment. Thumbs down, unsubscribbled. Disgusting. #dobetterkarl Rough back-of-the-envelope est is ESPN/ABC is locked into ~$4B/yr in sportsball contracts. To make it worse, NBA ratings are down 5% this year. So losing even 700K subscribers is going to leave a mark It does feel like the current strategy of all major businesses is to kill themselves It may feel like it, but is it happening? Are they dying? Certainly Disney isn’t. Video entertainment is an oligopoly, and the copyright monopolists can abuse their position to withhold stuff from any companies who’d want to undercut them. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I think it’s too soon to tell with Tesla. It could end up like Enron, but for now its stock price and sales remain high. “Fascist president unelect” might be a selling point for Trump voters who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in electric cars. People still refer to permissionless downloading as “piracy” and illegal (which it’s not in most countries), and have a general feeling of “wrongness.” I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Unless you mean de facto legal, then yeah. I’m not sure that’s true. Piracy is a copyright violation almost everywhere. Uploading copyrighted stuff without permission is usually illegal (though rarely criminal at non-commercial scale). Downloading is usually not, and in fact is sometimes explicitly legal due to copyright levies. they’ve learned nothing from history or experience To be fair, it’s not that they don’t learn. Capitalism dictates that revenue must go up. If they weren’t using the main leverage they have to make the line go up, they’d be replaced. Short of changing the rules of capitalism, there’s no other end than enshittification for such large enterprises. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Jeff Bezos-Backed Space Company Blue Origin To Lay Off 10% Workforce

Full Content:
Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin LLC is cutting about 10% of its workforce, a significant pullback aimed at slashing costs and refocusing resources after years of development work. The rocket and engine maker laid out the personnel shakeup during an all-hands employee meeting with Chief Executive Officer Dave Limp Thursday morning, confirming a workforce reduction first reported by Bloomberg. In a memo sent to employees, Limp said the company's growth led to "more bureaucracy and less focus" than needed after a hiring spree over the past few years. After years of expansion bankrolled by Bezos, who started Amazon.com Inc. and is the world's third-richest person, Blue Origin is looking to trim manager ranks as it works to clear some $10 billion worth of launch contracts. With a staff of more than 10,000, the layoffs stand to impact over 1,000 roles. Blue Origin is eliminating positions in engineering, research and development, and project management, as well as "thinning out our layers of management," Limp wrote in the email, which was viewed by Bloomberg. The surprise round of layoffs comes about a month after Blue Origin debuted its flagship New Glenn rocket following years of delays and development setbacks. Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000. Since then, the company's payroll has gone as high as roughly 14,000 employees spread across its headquarters in the Seattle area and sprawling manufacturing and launch operations sites in Florida, Texas and Alabama. Blue Origin maintains an ambitious space portfolio that includes space tourism, a moon lander, space station and supplying rocket engines. Blue Origin has drawn unfavorable comparisons to Elon Musk's SpaceX, which leapfrogged many startups over the past quarter century to become the world's most prolific rocket launcher. Limp, an ex-Amazon leader, was hired in 2023 to help shake the company out of a years-long R&D slump. Limp added that the company is looking to the future, including landing an uncrewed vehicle on the moon in 2025 and increasing the cadence of New Glenn and New Shepard launches.

Using Google Veo, Midjourney, and Runway, he created the 11.5-minute short in just 14 days, pushing AI tools to their limits. His previous AI-generated Batman short drew Warner Bros.’ legal attention, and Star Wars may follow suit. But instead of shutting him down, Hollywood should be learning from him. Cardoza’s Phantom X studio is already attracting interest from major brands and studios. This is scary. “In this latest AI short film/vignette,” says filmmaker Davide Bianca of Shifting Tides, “I wanted to experiment with the idea of building tension through silence, and see if I could create something truly eerie and unsettling, not through jump scares or heavy exposition, but through subtle characterization and minimal dialogue.” Extensive performance capture was done with Runway Gen3 Act 1 and an iPhone, and prompted performance in Kling 1.6, to create a sense of heightened awareness between the characters. Every glance, every subtle movement, and every moment of stillness had to carry weight. The challenge was to make the characters feel hyper-aware of each other without relying on excessive dialogue.” This column is also a podcast hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and co-founder of Red Camera, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap.

Title: Silicon Valley Software Engineers Horrified as They Can't Easily Find Jobs Anymore

Back in 2021, the tech industry was booming. Fueled by generous government subsidies and the pandemic economy, tech companies went on a hiring spree, promising unlimited time off and upward growth opportunities at open offices where kombucha and cold brew flowed from taps. Flash forward to now, and those taps have run dry. A seemingly endless wave of mass layoffs is ravaging the tech industry as startup fails skyrocket and tech giants shovel their operating budgets into the AI furnace. And of all the workers devastated by the carnage, former tech workers in Silicon Valley are having a particularly rough go of it. The region's former software engineers and developers — whose jobs were previously thought to be ironclad — are now having to contend with a fiercely competitive job market in one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. Many, like former Indeed managing engineer Daelynn Moyer, are considering leaving the industry altogether. The 55 year old life-long tech worker told the Washington Post that she's considering selling her house and retiring early to a farm, after 160 job applications went nowhere. "It would be a meager existence, but it would be fulfilling," Moyer told the paper. "I would no longer feel like a no longer useful commodity." Moyer isn't alone — industry events are becoming desperate job fairs full of unemployed tech workers sick of rejection emails. Many have taken to social media to share the misery of the job hunt with the growing mass of erstwhile tech workers. "I'm looking to move on from tech," commented one Reddit account on a thread about layoffs. "I am burned out on the lengthy interview process and then the rejections. It has done some damage to me physiologically." Another posted "lessons learned from my tech layoff," saying "I did not know who I was after I got laid off. I looked at myself in the mirror and I could not introduce myself to me. I regret caring so much about 'shareholder value.'" Unfortunately for American tech workers, the layoff train isn't slowing down. Yesterday, Meta kicked off "thousands of layoffs," amounting to roughly 5 percent of its staff, some of whom CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to replace with AI systems. And last week, Google offered workers severance in exchange for taking a voluntary layoff, signaling its intention to clamp down on its already consolidated hardware department, which had experienced hundreds of layoffs in spring of last year. While layoffs are becoming ubiquitous to all layers of tech, they're particularly insidious coming from the magnificent seven — stock-trader parlance for the tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta — which together are worth more than the stock markets of the UK, Canada, Germany, and France combined, or more than China's entire stock market, which is the second largest in the history of the world. Put it all together, and an industry that was just recently on top of the world is feeling some serious crunch. And while it's currently the rank-and-file taking the brunt, it remains to be seen how deep the cuts will go — especially because the tech sector, for now, seems hell-bent on pouring money into artificial intelligence.

Title: Republicans Fine With Leopards Eating Their Constituents' Faces First

Time Published: 2025-02-13T15:03:26Z

If there’s one thing that’s sacred to your free-enterprise capitalist types, it’s a contract between a buyer and a seller, or a borrower and a lender. You make a commitment to sell widgets, you’d better deliver those widgets, and if not, you will be banished from Libertarian Eden and condemned to peddle inferior socialist widgets in Latvia in 1955. That’s how we remember the excitable free enterprise Young Republicans in college at least, when they weren’t trying to bludgeon us with a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Of course, if the party making a contract was Joe Biden’s federal government, and that agreement was a loan for building an EV battery factory, well then the private companies, workers, and suppliers who thought those contracts were binding should have known better than to make any plans, especially not after Donald Trump was elected in November. America HATES the environment now, anyway. As The New York Times reports (gift link), that may come as a really unpleasant surprise to many in the red states that Trump relied on to win election, because now he’s decided to illegally block federal spending on anything related to clean energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, or people and geographic locations with the word “green” in their names. And as Yr Wonkette pointed out several times while Trump was preparing … OK, waiting, at least — to take office, a whole heck of a lot of the clean energy and manufacturing money from Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act ended up going to companies in red states. About 80 percent of it, as a recent analysis determined. Update: Just a reminder that this wasn’t by design: The tax incentives for manufacturers were agnostic as to location, and the siting location was up to the companies that took the deals. The south has cheaper labor because because of “right to work” (with no rights), so that was a big factor, as were other state-level incentives aimed at attracting bidniss. Now, when we pointed that out shortly after the election, back in our callow youth, we naively thought that, as with Pentagon contracts that send a little bit of every weapons system’s components to the home districts of key Congress members’ districts, that widely distributed IRA funding might mean support for keeping the legislation going. After all, local and federal electeds, and the companies getting the tax credits, would lobby hard to keep the money and jobs flowing. Thing is, even if those interests do want that to happen, Trump and Musk instead decided to bypass the Constitution and have Elon run the federal government. Boy, did we ever blow that guess! Wonkette sometimes gets it wrong because even our boundless cynicism can’t keep up. You should support us anyway! But even if red states haven’t squawked about it much, they’re definitely feeling the pinch. Since the IRA passed in 2022, private companies chasing the law’s tax breaks have announced plans to spend $165.8 billion to build factories that make solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and more, according to new data from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm. On top of the tax incentives, the IRA and the earlier Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been the sources for tens of billions of dollars in grant money to businesses, state and local governments, and nonprofits. Those grants aren’t just a free bucket of money, they’re binding contracts that have spurred investments, led companies to buy land, hire people, and contract for services, all based on the contractual obligation that the government would reimburse them. That was the deal, right there on paper or PDF, probably both. Now, along comes Trump: Since the federal spending freeze was announced January 27, federal courts have placed a hold on it, several times in fact. The most recent decision came Tuesday when an appeals court denied the administration’s request to pretty please let Trump withhold billions and billions of dollars in grants and congressional allocations. That hasn’t actually resulted in any of the funds being restored, however, and that’s been leading to layoffs and furloughs and smaller contractors closing up shop, far beyond the clean energy and tech fields we’re talking about in our story here. For red parts of the country, the freeze on energy and climate spending is already taking a toll, per the Times: In Montana, a biofuels plant did not receive on time a $782 million payment it was owed, the first part of a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee. In Georgia, $1 billion in projects to modernize the power grid are on hold. In Nevada, a half-dozen large solar projects on federal lands are caught in a permitting freeze That’s also going to mean trouble for clean manufacturing companies set to open in 2025, valued at roughly $30 billion. While some already faced delays or even cancellation due to factors other than the Trump freeze, the funding cutoff will kill a lot more if it remains in place. Here’s one such example that the Times didn’t cover: EV maker Rivian paused construction of a planned battery and EV factory in Georgia last year due to uncertainty about the market for its nifty electric pickups, SUVs, and those bulbous electric Amazon delivery vans. Business has since picked up, and in January, Rivian announced the factory was back on schedule, thanks to a new $6.6 billion loan from the US Department under the IRA. Hooray! Jobs! Prosperity! A factory to build the company’s new, more affordable (but let’s be honest, still luxury-market) R2 and R3 midsized models! And then, right on the tail of the happy news, the spending freeze slammed down. So far, Rivian hasn’t commented on whether its loan specifically was affected, but the timing of the loan and subsequent freeze certainly suggests Rivian will be feel the chill. Democrats are already sounding the alarm and fighting for clean energy investment to go forward even if it is happening outside their districts, because it’s good for America and the planet. And Republicans are being Republicans. Here’s how Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) bravely defended the $415 million in federal funding for his district, some of which will create 650 new jobs in an auto parts plant, but only if the plant opens: “There might be some things in there that are worth saving,” Ruli admits, possibly looking around furtively for one of Elon’s Dogboys. “That’s going to take a little time to figure out.” And then there are the Republicans who are delighted to see their constituents screwed, although they don’t say that openly; they just deflect. Rep. Rick Allen, whose Georgia district has seen $1.6 billion in private investments driven by the IRA, grumbled — with zero evidence of course — that maybe the federal grant process under Biden was improper, and shouldn’t we all be overjoyed that now everything is on hold, just to be sure? No, he didn’t have any proof, but it was Biden, it had to be corrupt. Binding contracts? Free enterprise? Well not if the contracts were corrupt! No, stop asking me for proof, I’m just asking questions. Please go bother a Democrat now We were amused that the Times says the freeze has put Republicans in a “tricky position” where they must defend Trump at all costs (must they?), even as they’re “working behind the scenes to protect their towns from the loss of new manufacturing jobs.” Not that any Republicans the Times talked to would go on the record and admit they’re making such “behind the scenes” efforts, of course. Instead, the accounts of quiet moves to protect jobs in Republican districts came from clean energy industry lobbyists who have been meeting with those politician, and say the Republicans definitely know how bad ending federal clean energy spending will by for their districts. One lobbyist, Bob Keefe of the nonpartisan business group E2, told the Times, “We just met with more than a dozen key Republican offices, and I can tell you nobody wants to kill jobs. They don’t want to have to go back and face constituents and tell them that the factory I just cut the ribbon on might not be coming. That’s going to put them in a hard place.” Just don’t say who those Republicans are, please, OK?

Just added an update pointing out that the IRA tax incentives weren't designed or directed to go to red states; the incentives were agnostic on location, but companies building factories tended to site in red states because of lower ("right to work" with no rights) labor costs and other factors. By illegally bypassing Congress altogether, Trump might save Republicans the trouble of voting to kill jobs in their districts. Wasn't that nice of him? And all it takes is a constitutional crisis!

Title: The State Of DEI: Practitioners Navigate A Shifting Landscape
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnarae/2025/02/13/the-state-of-dei-practitioners-navigate-a-shifting-landscape/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T11:00:00Z

Big group of people holding hands together making round circle shape. Colorful diverse friend team ... [+] concept, united community or social cooperation cartoon on isolated background. In 2023, a Pew Research Center survey showed that for “a majority of employed U.S. adults (56%), focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing,” with women, people of color and other demographic groups with marginalized identities voting in favor of DEI in higher numbers. In less than a month, despite broad public interest in DEI, President Trump has put an end to federal government spending on any efforts that seek to level the playing field for marginalized groups. A mandate that has been taken up by private sector companies, with little protest. Missing from the conversation on the federal government’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and rapid rollback of DEI among some of the world’s most visible companies is the impact on people who have championed workplace equity. DEI practitioners across the country are grappling with an uncertain future. Kim Flanery-Rye, founder of Inclusion Equals, had anticipated the shift and worked with clients in advance to prepare. "We discussed what their commitment to DEI would look like in different scenarios and how to prepare for potential impacts. We were already seeing the shifts in higher education, so the writing was on the wall. This wasn’t just theoretical; it was happening in real-time." And yet, despite data on the shifting landscape, practitioners feel gutted. "It's painful to see some of the work you and colleagues have done seemingly undone overnight," says Katrina Jones, a senior people and culture leader. For many DEI consultants, the impact has been both financial and deeply personal. "Many of our clients are pausing their DEI efforts" shares Sari De, founder of Nine of Us. "A few, who either are government bodies or who have major government contracts, have broken contracts with us, citing the executive order." Lindsey T.H. Jackson, a Seattle based consultant, echoes these concerns: "Over the past two weeks we have seen many RFPs and leads suddenly disappear. We have also had a handful of clients come to us to abruptly stop their work." For practitioners who are people of color, immigrants, or members of marginalized communities, the chilling effect of these policies extends beyond financial setbacks—it becomes a personal safety issue. De candidly shares, “I am a person of color, a woman, and an immigrant. I'm worried my work will put my citizenship in jeopardy, and I am carrying my US government ID (along with my foreign passport) with me at all times—the grocery store, the school pick-up.” The heightened fear of legal persecution is leading many to reassess their personal and professional choices, weighing risk against commitment to the work. For Flanery-Rye, the past few weeks have been a whirlwind. "I was overseas at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when the inauguration and the flurry of executive orders came through. Personally, as a DEI and culture practitioner, a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and a naturalized citizen through adoption, the announcements were confusing, terrifying, and gut-wrenching." The executive orders have left many organizations scrambling, uncertain of the legal and financial risks associated with running programs that prioritize women, queer and trans, and BIPOC employees. Language that was seen as bold, fair, inclusive, is now seen as legally risky communication. Many, especially Fortune 500 companies had been silently retreating over the past year, strategically dismissing employees with DEI titles. While layoffs are often attributed to business needs, many practitioners see a troubling pattern emerging as DEI positions are disproportionately affected. Last year, Microsoft laid off a DEI team, noting DEI was 'no longer business critical', along Meta, Amazon, dozens of non-tech companies, according to Fast Company. While some have chosen to quietly pull back newly made DEI commitments, others are doubling down. “The clients that are doubling down on DEI are actually increasing spending this year, continuing to support their ERGs and reassuring their employees that they will continue to speak up for their rights,” De explains. Jackson sees a similar pattern. “The vast majority of our clients have reached out to assure us that they will fight for their people,” she says. For those wondering how to support DEI efforts in this precarious climate, practitioners offer a clear message: action is needed. “More Upstanders, less Bystanders,” De asserts. “I want folks to feel comfortable getting their phones out when they see ICE detaining folks. I want people to feel like they can question officers when they board public transport or show up at school.” Allies have a role to play. "The ask is almost always the same," says Jones. "I'd like people to speak up, to speak out, to make noise, and join others to find a way forward." Flanery-Rye underscores the importance of economic and social support. "If you have economic power, put your money where it can have the biggest impact. If you have flexible time, use it to volunteer in your local community. If you have a public platform or social influence, use it to amplify voices." Allyship needs to come from leaders with influence on a national and global stage. DEI is more than anti-bias training and employee resource groups. In Assembly Required, David Glasglow, of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and Stacey Abrams us that DEI includes: A practioner anonymously shared that the field needs a clearer articulation of its value. "As a movement, we must do better to articulate what anti-bias work is all about and whom it serves. I have talked to many executives recently who are looking for language – when I start talking about DEI as supporting those with disabilities, or veterans, they seem shocked. We must do a better job articulating the full scope of this work." Despite the current challenges, practitioners are resolute in their belief that DEI will not disappear—it will evolve. "DEI won’t be erased, but for it to survive, it must evolve," says Flanery-Rye. "The real challenge is finding better ways to connect. It’s about making DEI real and relevant, rooted in lived experiences, backed by data, and communicated through compelling storytelling." DEI practitioners are facing one of the most challenging periods in recent memory, but their resolve is unshaken. As Jones aptly puts it, "This moment has also called out the need to frame the work clearly and pointedly so people understand it. That's an opportunity for evolution, which diversity, equity, and inclusion—and the people who lead this work—are more than capable of." The work will continue, shaped by those who refuse to be silenced.

Title: Tech companies laying off staff are still hiring — especially in AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-hiring-job-openings-ai-cloud-infrastructure-layoffs-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-12T19:03:29Z

Just because you've read about a tech company doing layoffs doesn't mean the company isn't continuing to hire. The first two months of the year have already seen many tech firms conduct or announce layoffs. While some may be looking to operate more efficiently, many have hundreds or thousands of open job listings. Backfilling the roles of laid-off employees or hiring more staff in divisions deemed a higher priority could build back head count levels in the coming year. In some cases, companies plan to grow their head count in the coming year, and one red-hot area many companies are bolstering hiring is AI, for example, and related divisions such as infrastructure and cloud computing. Here's a look at some tech companies that are still adding staff to their payroll amid layoffs. The workplace management platform is laying off 1,750 employees, or 8.5% of its workforce. CEO Carl Eschenbach told staffers in a memo he published that the company would "continue to hire in key strategic areas and locations" throughout fiscal year 2026. Workday is "prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board," he wrote. Workday has 348 job openings on its website as of this writing. Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce, targeting employees it says are low performers, with plans to backfill those roles later this year. The company is planning to hire "in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance," it said in its Q4 earnings last month. Meta appears to be accelerating hiring for machine learning engineers amid its layoffs, according to an internal memo viewed by BI. Meta has 1,750 job openings on its website as of this writing. Stripe has laid off 300 workers, primarily in product, engineering, and operations roles. The cuts represent roughly 3.5% of the payment platform's workforce. However, the company's chief people officer, Rob McIntosh, said in a memo to staff that Stripe is "not slowing down hiring." Stripe plans to boost its head count to roughly 10,000 employees by the end of 2025, which would be a 17% increase year-over-year, he wrote. Stripe has several hundred job openings on its website as of this writing. Salesforce is reportedly laying off 1,000 people, who will be able to apply for other positions internally, Bloomberg reported this month. The company has not publicly commented on the matter and did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in December that the company plans to hire 2,000 salespeople focused on selling its AI products. Salesforce has 995 job openings on its website as of this writing. Microsoft began performance-based layoffs at the end of January. Separate from the performance-based layoffs, the tech giant also made cuts across organizations including security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming, BI previously reported. Microsoft has 2,128 job openings on its website as of this writing. Layoffs can result in a domino effect in the tech industry — look no further than Mark Zuckerberg's famous "year of efficiency" or the CEOs inspired by Elon Musk's deep cuts when taking over Twitter. If that's also the case this time around, we could see other Big Tech companies carry out their own layoffs. At Amazon, for one, CEO Andy Jassy said last year that he wanted to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Google recently offered voluntary exit packages to US staff in its Platforms and Devices unit. Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of Google parent company Alphabet, said in October that the company would be looking for "additional opportunities" for cost cuts. Google simultaneously expects "some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud." And while Amazon and Google haven't laid out more explicit plans to ramp up hiring in AI, you can bet they're going to duke it out with their Big Tech peers in the heated AI talent wars. Big Tech firms have also made no secret of their ambitious spending plans when it comes to AI. Recent earnings from Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google indicate their combined capital expenditures are set to exceed $320 billion this year, driven largely by AI investments. Jump to
