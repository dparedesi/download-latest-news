© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.” To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.” It’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.” This “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.” Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.” Thiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. “Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.” The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.” William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.” In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. “There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.” Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.” The American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.” A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.” This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters. “‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.” The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.” Nikita Mazurov In new videos, Vice editor-in-chief Shane Smith treats immigrants as a problem and apologizes to Elon Musk for past coverage.

AI and automation are increasingly threatening marketing jobs; but one skill stands out as a career safeguard: SQL (Structured Query Language). While it might sound technical, SQL has become an indispensable tool for modern marketers who want to stay competitive and drive data-informed decisions. SQL’s true power lies in its near-universal adoption across modern data platforms and marketing tools. You’ll find SQL powering queries in Salesforce Marketing Cloud’s Audience Builder, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Snowflake, Oracle Database, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, SAP HANA, Adobe Analytics, HubSpot’s custom reporting, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, Shopify’s analytics, MongoDB (via SQL API), Teradata, MariaDB, SQLite, Vertica, Databricks SQL, Presto, Apache Hive, Apache Phoenix, SingleStore, CockroachDB, Cassandra (via SQL-like CQL), and virtually every major CMS and CDP. Marketing platforms have embraced SQL because it offers a standardized data access method. While each platform might have slight syntax variations or special functions, the core SQL concepts remain remarkably consistent. Once you learn SQL, you can work with data across virtually any marketing technology stack – from email marketing platforms to enterprise data warehouses. Born in the 1970s at IBM, SQL was initially designed to manage and query relational databases. What started as a specialized tool for database administrators has evolved into the universal data language. Today, SQL powers everything from small business databases to massive enterprise systems, making it the world’s most widely used database language. The marketing landscape has dramatically shifted. While creative thinking and strategic planning remain important, the ability to work with data has become crucial. Here’s why SQL matters for marketers: Instead of waiting for data teams to pull reports, SQL-savvy marketers can: Many of my colleagues have had a few difficult years and our industry has had a ton of layoffs. SQL proficiency opens doors to several advanced marketing roles that combine analytical skills with strategic thinking and open doors to lucrative roles that can start with incomes over $100,000 US. Examples: While AI may automate many traditional marketing tasks, the ability to write custom queries and analyze data remains valuable… where AI is actually an asset to assist you, not replace you. SQL isn’t as intimidating as it might seem. Think of a relational database as a collection of spreadsheets (called tables) connected through common identifiers. Each table stores specific information: Each table has: These tables are related to each other through shared values. For example, when a customer makes a purchase, their customer_id appears in the orders table, creating a relationship between the customer and their orders. Here are the fundamental concepts: The most common SQL command is SELECT, used to retrieve data: The result would return the selected fields: SQL shines when combining data from multiple tables: Customers Table: Orders Table: The result of the query: Want to understand patterns? Use aggregations: This produces summary statistics like: For marketers looking to acquire SQL skills, LearnSQL.com offers a comprehensive learning path specifically designed for non-technical professionals.

All right, are you ready to go back in time? It’s only nine years; you know, November 2015. Things were a little different. So yeah, let’s go back and talk about rugby and publishing and series bibles and lots and lots of cover discussion. On with the podcast. [music] Sarah: I think we said in the reviews episode, this is not a very exciting issue. I was hoping for a lot of nostalgia; I was hoping to be like, I remember that book; I loved that book. Either it was a month full of books that I wasn’t really enjoying very much, or this was just a boring month of releases for me? But this issue is also pretty dull. Amanda: Yeah. I would agree. For anyone who listened to the reviews episode, there wasn’t a lot of diversity in grades? Sarah: No. Amanda: A lot of things were four stars – Sarah: Yep. Amanda: – there were three stars, but rarely any two stars; definitely no single, single stars. Sarah: Yes. Amanda: So, and then even, like, the reviews weren’t very informative, right, so it’s a bit of a nothingburger. [Laughs] Sarah: It is; it’s kind of dull. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: So let’s get started! You can’t wait to listen to this, right? Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: The cover is – Amanda: …we preface with, it’s like, Ooh, what a boring issue. Let’s talk about it for forty-five minutes! Sarah: Yeah, this was, this was not exciting; however, we are very exciting. The cover is Samhain Celebrates 10 Years, and the 10 and the word Years are a collage of Samhain covers, which can tell because they had a little yellow corner flipping off at the bottom. The collage itself is very funny, because there’s so many pieces of abs. There’s just a bunch of abs. Just, you can’t tell what book it is; you don’t know what the author is; you can’t even see their heads; it’s just, Oh, there’s some abs. At least eight different abs are on the, on, in this collage. Amanda: My eye is, like, drawn to the Piper Huguley cover? Every single time, and I recognize that cover, like, so quickly. Sarah: It is, it does stand out, ‘cause it’s partially, I think, because it’s in that beautiful blue-gray tone, and also that model is gorgeous and has a neck. Like, whoo! Amanda: And no abs! Sarah: No, no abs. What is that? Virtuous something. I forget the name of this book. [A Virtuous Ruby] Amanda: But Samhain’s not around anymore, right? Sarah: Mm-mm. Amanda: Samhain’s closed, shuttered. Sarah: They’re gone. They’re gone. Amanda: Okay. Sarah: Lot of on, out-of-context abs. I mean, not that there’s a lot of abs in context in romance, but there’s a lot of out-of-context abs. Amanda: Yeah, I feel like that’s sort of, you know – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: – par for the course with romances. Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: [Laughs] Out-of-context abs. Sarah: And on page 2 is an ad from Kensington for Rebecca Zanetti’s book? I think it’s from Kensington ‘cause at the bottom it says Kensington Publishing, America’s Independent Publisher. It was for the Wicked Ride and Wicked Edge books? But this was an era when there was a lot of Photoshopped tribal tattoos on cover models. Everybody had that grayscale filter to make these tattoos look like they were on these guys, and you could tell that they were not. It’s a lot of tribal tattoo Photoshop. That’s the era that we’re in. Amanda: …bad, too, ‘cause it’s, it’s showcasing two covers. Sarah: Yep! Amanda: Both cover models are shirtless on motorcycles. Sarah: Which I can’t say I recommend, but okay. Amanda: No. The amount of, like, bugs that are just whipping against your skin. Sarah: [Laughs] You get off the bike, and you’re just covered with… Amanda: Covered in welts and dead bugs. Sarah: Look, their, their motorcycles don’t even have windshields. There’s no windscreen. It’s just dead bug city! [Laughs] Amanda: That one guy, you can see his face, ‘cause he’s sort of like leaning down a little bit? Sarah: Yeah, I know that model, too. Amanda: Just faceless. He doesn’t get a face on his cover. Sarah: Mm-mm. Amanda: So sad. Sarah: And it’s just, his eyes are gone. The cover, the cover is from, like, his, the top of his nose down. Like, it’s really weird! [Laughs] They’re covered with bugs! Amanda: Right. Yeah, his face is just covered in bugs! Sarah: On page 6 is the Letter from the Editor. This marks the first RT Review Source, which was their publication to review indie books, which, which you had to pay for those reviews. She talks about the glamorous – Wilbur would you like to know, he does not like this. What? What’s the problem? What is, is it, you don’t like the, you don’t like the Vegas? ‘Cause she’s talking about the, the glamorous Rio Hotel. Amanda: You’re valid, Wilbur. As someone who stayed at that hotel, you’re so valid? Sarah: Yeah, he, he disagrees. He’s like, That’s terrible. So this, I didn’t know this was going on, but I noticed this in the letter? She’s promoting everything that’s going to happen at RT in Vegas at the Rio, and one thing about this issue is, they are really pushing how far in advance and how, how far after you should stay to get every single experience. Like, you’re going to be there for a while if you do everything that’s in this magazine for the conference. Amanda: These conferences were long. Sarah: They were long by the end, yeah. Amanda: …long. Sarah: >> At 7 p.m., twenty-two fans will join bestselling historical romance author Sabrina Jeffries for a thirty-minute ride in a private High Roller cabin on the High Roller observation wheel. It’s like a big Ferris wheel. Amanda: Oh, okay. Sarah: >> As the, as the cabin gently ascends skyward, you’ll be able to enjoy an unforgettable view of the city at sunset while mingling with Sabrina and your fellow fans. At 7:30, a separate group of twenty-two attendees will board a bus to the Link for the same excursion, except this High Roller ride will be with YA and New Adult superstar Jennifer L. Armentrout. Each private – Amanda: That would be a hazard today. Sarah: Can you imagine? There’d be so many people fighting to get in that pod. >> Each private event will feature surprise goodies and a stocked bar, complete with bartender, all compliments of the author. And it’s thirty minutes, so you’ve got thirty minutes to get your drinks in! [Laughs] Amanda: I remember – and I don’t know if it was at this RT – it might have been a previous one – but I went to an event, and it was sort of like a, a bunch of round tables and I think it was mostly for bloggers or, like, people who cover romance novels, and so we were all seated at tables, and I remember – Sarah: I remember that. Amanda: – the only author I remember sitting at our table was Jennifer L. Armentrout! Sarah: No kidding! Amanda: And she was very lovely. The only thing I remember about the conversation that she had with us is that she, I don’t know if she still is, but she has a fear of flying, and she was talking about her flight out – Sarah: Oh no. Amanda: – wherever it was and how, how much turbulence there was and how it just exacerbated her fear of flying. But the fact that Jennifer L. Armentrout sat at a table, just a small, round table with like maybe six or seven other people? I don’t know; I can’t think of an even that would allow you to get that close or that amount of one-on-one face time with an author these days. Sarah: That was the thing about RT: if you were an author, if, even if you were a big name, there was going to be an event where you were just at a table with a bunch of people hanging out. That was something that definitely happened at RT, like, I just sat down at a table and there was so-and-so! Oh my gosh! Amanda: Or, like, waiting for your coffee at the Starbucks and, you know, running into an author – Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: – that, like, you’ve read and loved, because everyone’s wearing their badges, and you’re like, Oh shit, I’m standing in the line next to so-and-so! Sarah: Yep! The other part of this Letter from the Editor: >> Just remember what happens at the RT Book Lovers Convention stays in your heart. [Snorts] Amanda: No. Sarah: [Laughs] Okay. Amanda: I put that shit all over Instagram. Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: I’m telling everybody. I’m telling everyone that the hotel doesn’t have trashcans – Sarah: Oh, that hotel was terrible. Amanda: – coffee makers. Sarah: That was a terrible hotel. It was awful. It was super gross. So the feature on Samhain is on page 10. Happy Tenth Anniversary, Samhain Publishing, and it’s mostly interviews with the president and authors who write for them and how much the publisher does for those authors, and it’s clearly directed at prospective authors and not readers. Like, there’s nothing in here that’s interesting to just a random reader fan, unless you really want to know, like, the, the inner workings of everything. One thing I, I did find, this little time capsule in the article? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: >> With every purchase made on the Samhain website, the reader is given access to the books in all of their digital incarnations for the lifetime of their Samhain account. Which, as you might know, publisher’s out of business, so you don’t have one anymore. >> Please note this does not apply to Samhain titles purchased from other electronic retailers. So the benefit of buying directly from the publisher is that you would be getting the access to the book. You wouldn’t be getting a license to read the book on your device, the way you do with Amazon or other retailers; you got the book itself? Lot of publishers at the time were like, Nonono! Buy from us! We get a larger cut, and the author gets a larger cut, but you also just, you get the eBook file, and if it’s updated you get that too. Amanda: I also think – this is a focus on Samhain – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: – I don’t think you could do a publisher focus these days. I think, you know, ten years ago, I feel as if publishers had sort of like a distinct voice in what they were publishing and the kinds of romances they were publishing. Sarah: Yeah, they had, they had distinct, they had distinct lanes. Amanda: Yes, they had distinct lanes, and so, like, if you loved historical romance, it’s Avon, right? You’re going to go to the Avon parties, ‘cause it’s all going to be historical romance authors, yada-yada-yada. And it was easier, I think for me, to hear an author or see a book and automatically, without even checking the spine or – what is that called? The colophon? Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Is that what it is? Sarah: Yeah, the colophon. Amanda: Yeah. Colophon about, like, who publishes this? I could probably look at a book cover, look at a name, look at the genre, and immediately tell you, Oh, this is St. Martin’s, or this is Gallery at Simon & Schuster, or whatever. I don’t think that’s the case anymore. Sarah: I think a lot of the publishers have merged and become so corporate that there isn’t as much of a presence or voice in the community, but also the lack of a conference and the lack of getting to know the people who work at a house, thereby giving that, that house a personality, because, you know, Oh, that’s where your friend so-and-so works, that has also ended it too. Like, I know who to reach out to at most houses? But, you know, everyone switch, switches places at a publishing house when someone rings a bell, and – Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: – there’s not that many people working between layoffs and contraction. Publishers are just more anonymous monoliths now? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: That’s pretty, that’s pretty incredible in nine years, right? Amanda: And sad. [Laughs] Sarah: And it, and it fits with the era of social media, too, because at the time, on Twitter especially, brands were trying to have, like, character voices? Brands were trying to have a style – Amanda: Oh. Sarah: – and brands were trying to be, like, personalized? And that doesn’t always work. It certainly doesn’t work as well now. Now, you, you wanted to talk about page 12. Tell me everything. Amanda: So 12 is another feature about rugby heroes, Tackling Rugby Heroes, and I remember when, like, everyone thought rugby was going to be the next big thing in sports romances. Spoiler: It’s not. And that made me a little sad! I thought that was a really cool concept, ‘cause it’s sort of like football adjacent, right? But it never took off, or only took off for a certain amount of time, but they interviewed five authors for the piece, so. They had Kat Latham, Rosalind James, Nalini Singh, Mina Carter, and Donna Gallagher, and I’m mostly familiar with Kat, Rosalind, and Nalini, and I looked to see if Kat Latham was publishing anything current. Sadly, no. The last thing that she put out, she was part of a romance, a charity romance anthology in 2022? So it looks like she’s left the, the rugby scene. I liked that little period – [laughs] – romance trends. I thought it was really interesting. Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: I’d go back to it. Is anyone writing rugby romances these days? Drop ‘em in the comments! Sarah: Ro-, Rosalind James has that whole series. Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: And it’s great. I mean, if you want to mentally travel to New Zealand, it’s kind of cozy contemporary; the stakes are not huge. It’s not like, you know, there’s killers or, or, you know, menaces. It’s just, you know, Hey, I’m visiting New Zealand, and it’s really far from home and, Ho, hang on! This rugby player’s really hot and into me; what do I do? It’s, it’s very different now, isn’t it? Amanda: I know! And then after that feature, on page 20 – Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: I mean, there’s other features, but they’re all womp-womp, boring. Yasmine Galenorn is talking about her series bibles, and I’m fascinated by this concept. So she’s talking about how these series bibles are where she sort of collects details about characters – Sarah: Mm-hmm? Amanda: – settings, stuff like that, because Yasmine writes, like, urban fantasy, so a lot of her series have, like, a lot of worldbuilding, and they continue for several books. Like, I’m thinking of, like, Immortals After Dark by Kresley Cole; I can see why that would be helpful. Sarah: Oh yeah! Amanda: I mentioned this guy three, three books ago; what color are his eyes? I would love to look at these. I want to see how they’re laid out. I want to see how they’re structured? I would love to get my eyeballs on these puppies, and if any writers are listening and you do a series bible, I’d love to see photos of how you structure these. Yeah, I’m just fascinated by – Sarah: You would be so good at that, by the way. Amanda: Thank you! – by people’s, like – Sarah: Because your memory was, would be like, Boom. Oh, that’s – Amanda: [Laughs] Yeah! I’m, I’m curious how people organize? I love knowing different sort of organizational stuff that works for people? Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Bullet journaling? I’m, I can’t do that; that doesn’t work for me? I get so hung up on the aesthetics of a bullet journal that – Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: – I don’t start? ‘Cause I’m like, Oh no! I’m – Sarah: Yeah, you just – Amanda: – I can’t draw; I’m not creative like that. Mine are going to look ugly! And then I get – [laughs] – frustrated! But yeah, I think these are fascinating. I’m also curious how they’ve transitioned to digital now? Sarah: Yeah. But it’s a cool article, isn’t it? Amanda: I thought it was fascinating. I’d love to know what people are doing in 2024, if people are using series bibles? Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: But I also think a lot of people aren’t starting to write dozens-long series anymore. I don’t – Sarah: No! I don’t think it’s easy to sell them, either! Amanda: Yeah. I mean, you have people continuing, right? Like Kresley Cole’s continuing hers, but I can’t see people starting to write or work on a series or release a series that just keeps going and going and going. You might have like a trilogy or like maybe five-ish books, but I don’t see any really, really long ones anymore. Sarah: Page 33, and also on page 35, I just wanted to touch on these two, because these are ads from the publishers. They want you to go to their blogs; that’s the era we’re in. We have one from Ballantine, where you visit smittenword.com, and then Harper was epicreads.com, but these are just collages of books; here’s what’s coming out. The Smitten Word/Ballantine/Bantam/Dell/Loveswept ad is twelve books, and they are so of-this-time, right? Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. I remember seeing a lot of these. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: I read a lot of these. Like the M. O’Keefe one I read for sure. And then they have a YA one; like, Dumplin’ is on there? Like, Dumplin’s – Sarah: Yep. Amanda: – a movie now! Sarah: Yep! And look at all of the, on the YA one for Epic Reads from Harper, look at how many of these have white girl in a gigantic dress covers. Amanda: Yeah. That was – Sarah: Like – Amanda: – certainly of a time. Sarah: – complex hair, big ol’ gown. Amanda: Also, look at the social media images. Sarah: Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, is that Snapchat? Vine, and Kik? Oh God – Amanda: Yep, Snapchat, Vine, and Kik. Sarah: I think it’s very funny, though, that on these covers, you’re using all of this fabric and all these giant dresses to convey a very specific, you know, aesthetic, and that is still true when those dresses were worn. Wearing that much fabric and having that much fabric on your body was a sign of Hey, I’ve got money. Money, money, money. Amanda: Yeah. It’s like a royal fantasy, right? Sarah: Yeah. Big old – and listen, if I’m going to wear a dress – I don’t like wearing dresses – if I want one, I want one with a long skirt. I want a big, long skirt. All of the dresses that I’ve had, that I have, that I’ve kept, have big skirts. I like big skirts. Not like a, not like a ball gown. I don’t have, like, panniers, and I can’t rest anything on my, on my hips, but I like a long, wide skirt. It’s like wearing a nice, big blanket. I love a long skirt – Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: – so I love these! And then if you look at the, the Smitten Word, all of the sort of New Adult contemporary are shirtless guys, shirtless women; all of these people are touching each other. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: They’re all touching, they’re all kissing, they’re all, like, the, even the Jennifer Haymore Highland Heat, they’re, I don’t know what – is he kneeling? Wrapped in a – Amanda: It gives this, like – Sarah: – plaid? Amanda: – you know, intensity vibes, right? Like – Sarah: But she’s, like, lying on her back, reaching up, and he’s leaning over her and reaching under her, so they almost form like a, almost like a yin-yang symbol with their bodies? But they’re all lying on green plaid, so obviously it’s Scottish, plus Highland Heat. Covers now, even with people on them, they’re hardly touching. Amanda: Yeah, that’s true. Sarah: It’s very visually chaste now. And here they’re, like, practically licking each other. Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: You had the next note. What did you want to look at? Amanda: It was just page 59. It’s a big, full-page Debbie Macomber ad? And they’re advertising a fucking hardcover – Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: – Debbie Macomber book. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: And I’m like, I can’t remember the last time I saw a Debbie Macomber in hardcover? I’m curious if they still produce her books in hardcover? Like, maybe for large print, but for normal hardcover? I don’t know if this was like, Let’s try it out, ‘cause Debbie Macomber definitely has a dedicated reader base, in my opinion? Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: I don’t know if they’re going to be shelling out money for a hardcover. Sarah: I don’t – well, a library certainly will. Amanda: Oh, that’s true, yeah. Sarah: What this image – Amanda: I was just surprised. I was like, What?! Sarah: This image – so the, the, the ad, and I’m, I’m thinking this ad came from Debbie Macomber, not her publisher. Or I could be wrong; it could be the publisher. But the ad is just for the one book, Dashing Through the Snow, and it is a scene of a very small, like, village with, there’s one building that has a barn roof and a bunch of, like, colonial-looking buildings. They’re all trimmed with lights; there’s snow all over the ground. All of the trees and bushes and wreathes and everything are all lit up, and there’s a Golden Retriever standing in the snow with a big, red bow on his neck. And I’m looking at this, and the street scene is also the background of the ad, and I look at this, and I think of that article that we just saw about how all of the fall cozy images are AI? And my – Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: – first thought when I looked at this was, Is this AI? No, this is too early for AI! Somebody assembled this; this is not AI. [Laughs] Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: But doesn’t this have that same sort of soft-focus aesthetic? Amanda: Oh, I can one hundred percent see that if they were to recreate a similar cover now? Sarah: It would be AI. Amanda: It would, it would be some kind of generative tool, for sure. Sarah: Yeah. The dog would only have like three legs and two tails, and we’d, like, stare at it and be like, Wait a minute, that’s weird. Amanda: Like a gazillion teeth. Sarah: [Laughs] I know! Amanda: Some kind of eldritch horror dog. Sarah: Yep. On page 61 is another assembly of covers. I mean, if you’re going to buy a full-page ad, advertise all the books you got coming out that month! It’s a good way to reach readers, especially because, even in the PDF, in the color version – like, this magazine is full color, but it’s PDF; they don’t reproduce all the covers, and you could, with the reviews, show the covers so that people will remember the visual of what book it is, but there, there’s only a handful of covers in the review sections. This assembly of covers, again, so much small town. Two people about to kiss, touching, all over each other, in a field, on the grass, in the snow. Small town is two people about to neck in a field. Like, that’s the cover formula. Amanda: And I don’t know why it is now, but with illustrated covers, I love an illustrated cover that sets a scene and that shows the characters interacting with each other. I prefer those sorts of covers because it, you know, I don’t know, it gives me more of an idea – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: – of what I’m getting into? I mean, we can go onto a longer rant of like, Oh! Illustrated covers don’t match the book! Or whatever. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: But that gives me more of a feel for the book than, you know, border stuff and then just two characters on either side of the cover. You know what I mean? Like, where it’s just like, figure, figure, you know, border décor. Sarah: Yeah. Amanda: Like, they’re not interacting at all. That, to me, just feels so, like, stiff, and it’s like cardboard. Like, they just look like cardboard cutouts. Just – Sarah: Like little paper dolls stuck on the cover, right? Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: Yeah, exactly that. I completely agree. What’s weird to me about this particular cover is how you have the, the, the small towns, and the predominant is, you know, two people about to neck in a field, and then you have the sort of spicy ones where they’re, like, full on groping each other, and then you have just, I’m not wearing a shirt. [Laughs] That’s, that’s what we’ve got here; we’ve got two guys who got dressed, but they forgot their shirts. Amanda: Hey, one second. The In Bed with the Bodyguard? Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: His gun holster is beneath the shirt, which, if your shirt is buttoned? You’re not getting that fucking gun out of there! Sarah: Amanda, I just pulled up the big version of that because I was so confused why his gun was inside his shirt. I noticed the same thing! [Laughs] Amanda: If your shirt is buttoned, you cannot get access to your gun. So is he just, you know – Sarah: Walking around like that? Amanda: – out all the time? So he can access his gun? Sarah: If you’re in bed with the bodyguard, you’ve got to know what you’re getting, I guess, before you get in bed, but he’s just going to walk around with his blue – Amanda: You think he takes the gun off when he gets into bed, or he sleeps with it on? Sarah: No. Heroes like that never take their gun off. So, like, this guy’s walking around with his shirt open, and you can see in the picture, if, like, you look at a big version of the cover? You can see the other side of the holster, ‘cause they usually go over both shoulders, right? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: You can see that he’s wearing the holster, but it’s under his shirt! Amanda: Like, hear me out. Hear me out. Sarah: Okay, I’m listening. Amanda: What if – Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: What if there’s like a little flap, you know, like, where you wear like a little red onesie, the little, like, long underpants, and you’ve got the butt flap? What if he’s got a little gun flap? Sarah: [Laughs] He’s got custom tailored shirts with little Velcro to pull his gun out. Amanda: But yeah! You know, like a breastfeeding bra or shirt where you can just sort of like, you know – Sarah: Just pop a tit out… Amanda: – subtly unclip and just pop a boob out? That’s what – he wears breastfeeding shirts! Sarah: I was going to say, the gun is right underneath his nipple; I bet he has a whole line – Amanda: He’s wearing breast – Sarah: – of maternity tops. He’s got breastfeeding – Amanda: Shopping in the maternity section – Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: – for his gun! Sarah: Oh my God. Amanda: We solved it, guys. Sarah: We solved it! [Laughs] Amanda: Case closed. [Laughter] Sarah: That cover is ridiculous. [Laughs] Amanda: Do you think the gun is Photoshopped? Does it look Photoshopped? Sarah: I can’t tell if this gun is Photoshopped, because while it is not creating any kind of crease on his shirt, on the fabric? You can see the other side of the holster peeking out from the other side of his shirt, so I honestly can’t tell if he’s got, if that’s a Photoshop or if he’s actually just put his shirt on on top of his gun for some odd reason. Amanda: This is my real thought of what happens, okay? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: Also, side note? That nipple’s going to get so chafed… Sarah: Oh my God. And look at all the stubble on his chest. Like, he didn’t shave his treasure trail? His treasure trail is nice and, you know, wholesome, but his chest and his pecs are covered with stubble. Like – Amanda: He shaved it, and it’s growing back. Sarah: Yeah. I don’t want to go anywhere near bed with this guy; I’m going to get a rash! Amanda: So I think this is really what happened is they were doing a photo shoot with this model. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: They were doing a lot of shirtless, holster-on photos – Sarah: Mm-hmm. Amanda: – and maybe it’s annoying to put on and off, so when they’re taking more photos, instead of taking the holster off and putting the shirt on and then putting the holster back on, they’re like, Oh, just throw a shirt over it, for time and energy. That’s what I think probably happened. Sarah: Oh yeah! You’re very likely to be right about that, totally, because, I mean, it, it’s just a photo shoot, he’s going to pop his shirt on, but if you look at the photo, the fabric is not creasing around the gun at all. Amanda: No. Sarah: But it’s right up against it, so I don’t know if that’s Photo- – I mean, listen, we were Photoshopping on tribal tattoos left and right; why not a piece of a, a gun? What, even what kind of a holster like that? Amanda: [Indistinct] I think it’s real, ‘cause if they did Photoshop it, to your point, like, I don’t think they would have bothered to, like, put in a sneaky little other side of the holster underneath. Sarah: Mm-hmm. And that’s definitely some kind of holster back there, right? Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: Okay. This cover’s amazing. We could do a whole episode just on this cover ‘cause it’s ridiculous. I love it. This magazine is such a gift! Page 77, there is an ad for an anthology. I remember when these were happening all the time. There’s at least fifteen authors in this anthology, and it’s called Mischief under the Mistletoe: Holiday Hotties. Preorder now for 99 cents. So you could preorder this massive, massive anthology of books or short stories or whatever, and after release date it would be more than a dollar, but this was a way in which a lot of people could game the bestseller list, because you’d get a ton of preorders, ‘cause who the hell doesn’t want like twenty books for, for 99 cents? Doesn’t even matter if they’re all good; just a few of them are good and you’ve, you know, you’ve made your money back. You, you, you got a worthwhile purchase at a dollar. Do you remember when these were happening all the time? Amanda: They still happen every so often. Sarah: Yeah. But I remember these were being, these being a very frequent event, and here they’ve got like a, almost a half-page ad for one! Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: I hope this, I hope this did well! Amanda: The next thing, I picked an ad on page 83, and it’s like a Thanksgiving ad? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: And it says: >> Give thanks for delicious digital romance. And there’s like corn and pumpkins and chestnuts and stuff. Sarah: Some gourds. Amanda: But my brain immediately went to, like, you’re sitting around your Thanksgiving table with your family, and, you know, sometimes families do like, What are you thankful for this year? And what if you just said, I’m thankful for delicious digital romance, and then your parents look at you like you’re fucking crazy? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: I’m thankful that I can get my smut digitally now. Thanks. What a weird way to position your books by tying it into Thanksgiving? Sarah: Yeah! Amanda: And none of these are a Thanksgiving romance. That’d be different. Sarah: Nope! They’re just, they’re just November books, and some of these covers are wild, right? Amanda: They’re bad. Sarah: Within a Captain’s Hold? That guy looks creepy! He’s got a big red bandana, and he’s giving you a creeper look! Amanda: Yeah, I don’t like the covers at all. Sarah: I don’t like this one. Like, it’s just not working for me. Also, Boyfriend for Hire, she’s got giant hair. Amanda: Yeah. Good for her! Sarah: Good for her. My hair doesn’t do that. Amanda: That’s windblown, for sure. Sarah: That’s, that’s back-combed and windblown. Amanda: Also, it looks like there’s a double space between delicious and digital. Instead of a single space. Sarah: I think you’re right. Well, that’s going to drive me absolutely – Amanda: Just a little nitpick. Sorry! [Laughs] Sarah: That’s going to make me twitchy! So then we get to the conference. I wasn’t kidding when I said there wasn’t a lot in this, in this magazine. We get right to the end of the conference, and they are promoting the conference very, very hard. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: It’s in Vegas; it’s at the Rio. Sorry, everybody, we’re going to talk about the Rio again. Amanda: Oh great. Sarah: And they have so many pre-convention things. Like, there’s, you can buy a tour of the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon. Pre-convention tours! More stuff to do before the conference! Like, they really were vacation planning for people with these things. But I, if I did this, if I did all these pre-conference events, by the time the conference started I’d be exhausted. Amanda: Yeah… Sarah: That’s a lot of humans there. Amanda: So we would always go as a group, Sarah and I and then some of the reviewers who wanted to go, usually two or three of them. Sarah: Mm-hmm! Amanda: And when we went to Vegas, so Rio was off the Strip; it’s not on the Strip, so we had to take an Über to the Strip, and I think we had dinner in one of the other, like, hotels on the Strip; I can’t remember which one. But I told Sarah that it was my dream to look at a menu and tell a waiter that we’ll take one of everything? Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: And so as we were nearing the end of dinner and we got the dessert menu, and I think there was maybe like four or five different desserts, Sarah let me tell the waiter that we’ll take one of everything, and it felt so good! Sarah: [Laughs] Amanda: To say that. Sarah: It was fun, though! Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: It was super fun. That was a good dinner, too. Amanda: It was a yummy dinner. Sarah: So then we move into the first indie hybrid news and reviews supplement. The inside back cover is an ad for Vegas. The back cover is an ad for the entire Shadowhunters series? Because the TV center, the TV series was coming to ABC Family. I watched so many GIF sets of that television show. Tumblr was mad for that show. So many GIF sets, especially the two dudes. Amanda: Well, I think Tumblr users and Cassandra Clare Shadowhunters fans is a circle. Sarah: That’s a flat circle. Yeah, that’s a flat circle. Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: So the indie hybrid news and reviews supplement is at the end of only the digital edition of the magazine, and this was at a time when you could sort of subscribe to the magazine but just get the digital edition in your email rather than getting the physical magazine. Page 103 of the PDF, Kathryn Falk introduces the whole thing and says: >> Inspired by the ever-changing landscape of publishing, RT Book Reviews Magazine founder Kathryn Falk has set her sights upon the thrilling community of independent authors. By recognizing a gap in structure amidst a sea of potential, it has become a personal mission of hers to gather the best and brightest of the self-published romance industry to share their combined wisdom and lead with passion into a new frontier. TL;DR: We can make money here. The cost for the reviews is on the first page. Up to four hundred and fifty pages, a review is four hundred and twenty-five dollars. If it was more than four hundred and fifty pages, it was five hundred dollars. If your book was four hundred and fifty pages or more, you paid five hundred dollars for the review. Reviewers were not being paid that much. Not at all. And the reviews are rather interesting. There’s a little bit of, like, you, you know how, you ever listen to a whole bunch of author interviews, and after a while you see the same question like, What was it like when you got the call? How did you get your agent? When, what was your first book? What, What’s the book of your heart? There’s a set of questions that you hear a lot? In this feature, there’s indie authors, like, talking about how they became indie, and so many of them were, I laid, I got laid off; I lost my job. I decided I had enough money to really give self-publishing a try. And this was at a time when you could actually make that a success for a little while, which I, it’s, it’s a time I kind of miss, ‘cause it was pretty great. Amanda: There were, there was, I think it was a feature in Jezebel. Sarah: Mm-hmm. Ooh, time capsule! Amanda: I know! And they did a feature on the, I think it was two authors who wrote together to write Bigfoot erotica, and obviously indie-pubbed, and they were talking about how there were times where they made thirty thousand dollars in a month on just Bigfoot erotica. Yep, found it. I found the post where they said thirty thousand dollars a month. >> Wade said she makes up to thirty thousand dollars a month via Amazon’s Kindle Direct publishing and has already produced sixteen volumes in her Cum for Bigfoot series. Sarah: Cum for Bigfoot! Those days seem to be very much gone. Amanda: It’s a startlingly large amount of Bigfoot erotica. Sarah: Yeah. There’s a bunch of business card ads on page 106 and 107. There’s photographers; there’s design. I think this is a formatting? Yeah, eBook and paperback formatting – this ad is very hard to read – which you can do now with, like, Vellum. Like, I think a lot of – Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: – word processors’ll format your, format your eBook for you. But page 107: >> Lil Book Bug, new and recycled books. Quality books at reasonable prices. Palmdale, California. And the ad is just that information, and then an illustration of three dancing kittens, and I love it so much. Amanda: It gives, like, sort of like, you know, like those posters, it’s like, Hang in there, baby! Sarah: Yeah! It’s little dancing, little dancing – Amanda: [Laughs] Sarah: Even the cats have little shoes on and a little dress. Like, they’re super – Amanda: Yeah! Sarah: – I don’t – I looked: Lil Book Bug does not seem to exist anymore, but this ad just was so charming and perfect, and it’s just adorable! And I love it. So the rest of the indie supplement is features and how to go indie, like rules for going indie? And it’s not actually very informative! It’s very, very surface level. And then the reviews are four stars, four stars, four stars, three stars. Like, that’s it. Amanda: I mean, like, I would personally be pissed if I paid five hundred dollars and got a one-star review? [Laughs] Sarah: I, I think, if I remember correctly – and I may be misremembering – I believe that if you paid for a review, you got the review, but you also got to say whether or not you wanted it to be published. So they may have been like, This is not, this is not going to be great; it’s going to be a two-star review. Do you want to publish it? But, you know, we’ll review it and send it to you. I do love that Come Dancing by Leslie Wells is in here, because that was self-published, and I think that might have been picked up by a publisher, but I remember her advertising the series with me on the site and how many readers loved the Leslie Wells books. Amanda: Yeah. Sarah: There’s two of ‘em. I think two. And then the magazine just ends. Like, there’s no back cover or – Amanda: [Laughs] Just like, oh, we’re done now. Sarah: We’re done now. Here’s a supplement. Thanks very much. So yeah, that was RT November 2015. Thank you for journeying back in time with me again! Amanda: You’re welcome! Sarah: Sorry this one was a bit of a snooze, but we made it fun. Amanda: Yeah. We always do. [outro] Sarah: And that brings us to the end of this week’s episode. Thank you for hanging out with us. I’m curious: are you a bullet journal person? Do you get all artistic with your journal? I could never get into bullet journaling as a schedule thing because the idea of having to constantly rewrite the schedule and draw a calendar every week just made me want to lie down. But I do love journaling in a really nice notebook with really bad handwriting, and I’d love to know if you do as well. I also would like to tell you that we are not going to do a Romantic Times Rewind episode in December. Why? Because it’s end of the year listener episode times! Woohoo! If you’re a member of the Patreon, you should have already seen a link in the Patreon or in the Discord where you can sign up. And if you would like to join the Patreon and be part of this, you absolutely can! Listen, if you sign up for the Patreon for a month, download a bunch of stuff, and then cancel, it’s totally fine! Like, literally awesome. Thank you. But here’s what’s going to happen: if you are in the Patreon, you can sign up to connect with me, and we’re going to have a little conversation over Zoom. I will record it, and you’re going to tell me your favorite read of this year, your wishes for 2025, and a bad joke if you wish. I love doing these, and I know how much you enjoy listening to everyone else, so if you’d like to be a part of it, please, please, please join the Patreon, and if you’re already in the Patreon, sign up for a slot! I promise I’m super chill, I’m really nice [True! – gk], and, I mean, it does say Bitches on my business card – I have to honor that – but, like, seriously, I can’t wait to talk to you. Seriously, I’m really, really excited, to the point where I’m stuttering about it! So please sign up if you’re interested. It’s so wonderful to talk to all of you around the world this time of year, and I’m starting earlier so I can make sure everyone gets a chance. So again, if you are in the Patreon, look at patreon.com/SmartBitches for the post with the link to sign up for a time, or head over to the Discord; I put it in multiple channels. Or you can just email me and I’ll send it to you, but I would love for you to be part of these episodes. As always, I end with a really bad joke, and this joke is terrible, which is why I’m telling you. What happens when a microscope crashes into a telescope? Give up? What happens when a microscope crashes into a telescope? They kaleidoscope. [Laughs] Silly jokes, silly jokes, love them! Collide-o-scope. [Sighs] Such a delight to end every episode with truly terrible humor. On behalf of everybody here, including the cat, who is snoring, and also very loud on this episode – my gosh, Wilbur had a lot to say; he’s going to have multiple lines in the, in the transcript. Either way, we wish you the very best of reading. Have a wonderful weekend, and we will see you back here next week! Smart Podcast, Trashy Books is part of the Frolic Podcast Network.

Romantic Times Rewind It seems like hockey smut has beat out rugby smut. There are so many hockey books out there, and not many rugby. Thanks for a fun episode, Sarah and Amanda, and for the silly joke which made me laugh. No bullet journal here either. Still no ability to get the hearts to work.

[singing] everybody must carve stone... “Cheating...” Fair enough. But the same could probably have been said with the introduction of any new technology to the field. The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo’s David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I’d imagine that there’ll be a market for that sort of thing. all the time or just rainy days? You miss the point. Reproductions/replicas are not art, they are copies. There’s a robotic bumbershoot that helps with that. Perfect counterfeits, and if from same quarry, who can tell? You miss the point. I never said that such things weren’t copies. Are you saying if I take a picture of the mona lisa or do a step by step “paint by numbers” copy - that’s it’s different than creating the original work of art? “The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels.” True... but at least he had to sculpt. He couldn’t go into town for a sandwich and let the power tools do it all. Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That’s not to say that AI-created designs wouldn’t also be possible. If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let’s keep raising that minimum wage! Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

Title: How the entrepreneurs behind Verb built a rapidly growing agency from scratch

Advertisement November 14, 2024 | 6 min read Listen to article 4 min Winning Gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category is Verb. Here's how, in its own words, it went from nothing to industry-leading in six years. How agency Verb won gold at The Drum Awards for Agency Business in the Entrepreneur category / Credit: Verb “Okay, we have three months before we have to go get a job.” In 2018, armed with only their bank accounts and credit cards, Shannon Jones and Yadira Harrison had left their roles at an experiential marketing agency with the goal of truly making inspiring and different work. They calculated that they could keep their business afloat for 100 days before they’d need to do something else. Three days later, they signed Nielsen, Amazon and Lyft. Fast-forward to now: Shannon, Yadira and the 85-person strong Verb team is regularly turning out headline-grabbing work that leaks on Reddit and breaks on TMZ. This top-of-line work includes the Hello Seven Millionaire Summit 2024, back for its second year after 99% attendee satisfaction in 2023. Shannon and Yadira architected the summit alongside visionary founder and author Rachel Rodgers. Held in Puerto Rico, it brought together IRL Hello Seven’s diverse and inclusive community to network and learn financial and business advice. Here's another one: the launch of seven 'Airbnb Icon' experiences in one week, including the now-famous floating Up house. After the launch of over 15 'Only On Airbnb' activations and the wild success of Barbie’s Dreamhouse in 2023, Verb was tapped for more. In summer of 2024, Verb successfully launched The Up House, The X-Men Mansion, The Inside Out House, Edna’s Mansion from The Incredibles and the Feid Tour Experience. From The New York Times, The Today Show, TIME and CNN to Designboom and Dezeen; everyone was sharing Verb’s hard work launching the Icons as a new Airbnb product offering. The numbers speak for themselves. While contacts with clients were being rapidly let go in 2023, Verb maintained 100% of their staff and hired an additional 50 team members. In 2024, the agency is tracking for 320% revenue growth. Advertisement The way Shannon and Yadira create an authentic team truly sets Verb apart, with an internal culture that not only allows employees to thrive, but to excel in their fields. During 2023, when projects were being canceled and then reinstated during a period of high turnover across the industry, Verb doubled down on internal culture, maintaining the small-agency, everyone-fits-inside-one-car culture while adding new team members. Having no layoffs in 2024 helped ensure that the team would see the other side of the uncertainty. Verb has never operated with hierarchy or titles in mind. As shared by Yadira’s former executive assistant (now member of the creative team) Alex Rodberg, “Yadira invited me to contribute my ideas for a new project. Despite my initial apprehensions, Yadira saw something in me that I didn't recognize in myself – a potential to think outside the box and bring fresh ideas to the table.” Verb has never had to create DE&I goals. From its roots in 2018, diversity has been an innate component of the agency. The team spans four generations, with senior leaders as young as 26. When a prospective client asked to see resumes and portfolios for the entire Verb team, Shannon and Yadira pushed back. Verb doesn’t require that information for hiring (one team member used to work for Beyonce. Who needs more of a resume than that?). They did, however, ultimately collect resumes out of curiosity and found that many of their team members had advanced degrees in other fields. Advertisement As of March 2023, the team is led by a minority-majority, with women and people of color at the helm. Verb has created a space where code-switching is dropped at the door, and all are safe to express and present themselves as they truly are. As Kindra Meyer, Verb’s recently acquired executive creative director attests: “Shannon and Yadira have quietly, just by their nature, created a revolution at Verb. They built from a foundational need to create a space they could empower others and open doors, the antithesis of what they experienced in the industry.” Through creative expertise and vision, Shannon and Yadira have proven their ingenuity and forward-thinking as entrepreneurs. That has never been more evident than when looking at the work created in the past year. At the helm of Verb, this duo is raising industry standards in creativity, execution and commitment to excellence. Today, six years on and tracking to at least triple year-on-year revenue while growing their outstanding team, Shannon and Yadira are facing the biggest challenge many entrepreneurs face: the business is not just theirs anymore. The new leadership team is looking to rebrand Verb and take the company past the referral-only model. But that’s also the mark of a great business — one where everyone feels ownership and wants to bring out the best in themselves and others. “The green is staying though, that’s all I want,” said Shannon.

Title: Both men and women will switch jobs for higher pay—but what it takes to keep them is different for each group

Good morning! Employers right now may have the upper hand when it comes to hiring, but many employees are still eyeing the exit. That means that business leaders and HR managers still have to think hard about ways to engage their workforces—but not every group is motivated by the same perks. Overall, about 54% of employees have no plans to leave their current company or role in 2024—a slight uptick from 52% in 2023, according to a new report from Alight, a consulting technology company. But the top motivators to stay are different for men and women. Around 21% of women rank satisfaction with their work-life flexibility as the main reason they’re sticking around. Meanwhile, only 10% of men surveyed said the same. Yet 13% of both women and men listed job or company stability as their main motivator, signaling security is a priority all around. “It’s important to understand your retention and attraction efforts as an employer should be different. It’s not one-size-fits-all,” Laine Thomas Conway, VP of engagement services strategy at Alight, tells Fortune. When it comes to what would make a worker consider a new job with another company, women and men are generally in agreement: higher pay. But the topic is even more important for women, with around 46% ranking higher wages as the primary reason they would leave, compared to 39% of men, according to the report. “When we’re looking at job stability and jumping for pay, it’s really important to know that women feel much more challenged about their budgets and savings, and that they definitely need more help,” Thomas Conway says. “Employers [need to] make sure that they are promoting the tools that are going to make women feel more confident in their futures, in their day-to-day budgeting, and how they are navigating the world.” Emma Burleigh emma.burleigh@fortune.com Today’s edition was curated by Brit Morse. A round-up of the most important HR headlines. Some cases making their way through federal courts could have catastrophic consequences for minority-owned businesses that do work for the federal government. Washington Post Recruiters are now urging job candidates to use AI tools to help them land a gig. Such views show how vital the technology has become in the last few years. Financial Times Amazon is phasing out streaming platform Freevee and integrating its content into Prime Video. Insiders say the move could foreshadow rounds of layoffs. Business Insider Everything you need to know from Fortune. At Fortune Global Forum earlier this week, the CEO of Glassdoor shared which jobs he thinks will thrive amid the AI boom, and which ones will be phased out. —Emma Burleigh John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation HOPE, said at Fortune Global Forum this week that for the U.S. to continue growing economically, it can’t afford to cut off women and minority communities from wealth gains. —Paolo Confino Companies are adopting AI but they’re still holding onto workers, IMF first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath said at Fortune Global Forum this week. That could change, however, if a recession hits and businesses make an “abrupt shift” to automation. —Paolo Confino. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
