ByRichard Nieva ByRichard Nieva, Forbes Staff. Between meetings in April, Micha Kaufman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, fired off a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn’t mince words: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too,” he wrote. “This is a wakeup call.” The memo detailed Kaufman’s thesis for AI — that it would elevate everyone’s abilities: Easy tasks would become no-brainers. Hard tasks would become easy. Impossible tasks would become merely hard, he posited. And because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. In the shuffle, people who didn’t adapt would be “doomed.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me — that they aren’t imagining stuff.” Already, younger and more inexperienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment rate; the total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. It isn’t just lack of experience that could make getting a job extremely difficult going forward; Chen notes too that the market may be tougher for those who are just average at their jobs. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring,” said Chen, adding that companies are starting to focus more on employing experts in their fields. “The superstar workers are in a better position.” Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S., shared by the HR company ADP, to examine generative AI’s impact on the workforce. The employment rate decline for entry-level developers is small, but a significant development in the field of engineering in the tech industry, an occupation that has seemed synonymous with wealth and exorbitant salaries for more than a quarter century. Now suddenly, after years of rhetoric about how AI will augment workers, rather than replace them, many tech CEOs have become more direct about the toll of AI. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment up to 20% within the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that AI will “reduce our total corporate workforce” over the next few years as the company begins to “need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.” Earlier this year, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke also posted a memo that he sent his team, saying that budget for new hires would only be granted for jobs that can’t be automated by AI. Tech companies have also started cutting jobs or freezing hiring explicitly due to AI and automation. At stalwart IBM, hundreds of human resources employees were replaced by AI in May, part of broader job cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work that could be done by AI. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had slashed its workforce 40%, in part due to investments in AI. “We’re going from mass hiring to precision hiring. The superstar workers are in a better position.” Microsoft made its own waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, or about 4% of its workforce. The company didn’t explicitly cite AI as a reason for the downsizing, but it has broadly increased its spending in AI and touted the savings it had racked up from using the tech. Automating customer service at call centers alone, for example, saved more than half a billion dollars, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of code at the company is being written by AI. “This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities,” one laid off Microsoft employee told Forbes. Microsoft didn’t respond to questions about the reasons behind its layoffs, but said in a statement: “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.” It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts at any given company. The overall economic environment could also be a factor, marked by uncertainties heightened by President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff plans. Many companies also became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could still be trying to correct for overhiring. According to one report released earlier this month by the executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, AI may be more of a scapegoat than a true culprit for layoffs: Of more than 286,000 planned layoffs this year, only 20,000 were related to automation, and of those, only 75 were explicitly attributed to artificial intelligence, the firm found. Plus, it’s challenging to measure productivity gains caused by AI, said Stanford’s Chen, because while not every employee may have AI tools officially at their disposal at work, they do have unauthorized consumer versions that they may be using for their jobs. While the technology is beginning to take a toll on developers in the tech industry, it’s actually “modestly” created more demand for engineers outside of tech, said Chen. That’s because other sectors, like manufacturing, finance, and healthcare, are adopting AI tools for the first time, so they are adding engineers to their ranks in larger numbers than before, according to her research. Automating jobs has its limits, too. Last year, Klarna said that the company’s AI tools were doing the work equivalent to 700 customer service agents. But a year later, the company seemed to reverse course, announcing a recruitment drive to hire more human agents. CEO Siemiatkowski has denied the new hiring push meant the company was pulling back on AI. Instead, he said the new human agents would handle more of the higher-end conversations the company had previously outsourced. Siemiatkowski was not available for an interview, but Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom defended the strategy. “We rely on AI just as much,” she said in a statement. “However, we have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” she continued, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Klarna’s experiments show that deciphering which tasks are more suitable for humans, and which can be entrusted to machines, is an open question. Siemiatkowski has been one of the most vocal proponents of automation: to prove the point, when Klarna announced first-quarter earnings in May, he didn’t even show up. Instead, he arranged for an AI deepfake of himself to give the financial update and trumpet a profitable three months. The upside to the upheaval, Fiverr’s Kaufman said, is that people seem willing to learn. (The company hasn’t done any AI-related layoffs or hiring freezes, he told Forbes.) In his memo to employees, he said he would hold office hours to discuss the changing AI landscape with anyone who wanted to chat. He booked a conference room for 50 people. To his surprise, he showed up to find 250 employees waiting for him. “So it was just, ‘All right, let’s do this,’” Kaufman said. He told employees they needed to be proactive to learn new AI techniques, and not just wait to be taught. “I'm going to help anyone who is motivated to help themselves.”

Title: The ex-Amazon employee who's helped nearly 4,000 laid-off workers score jobs

A few years after Amir Satvat landed his first video-game job at the age of 38, layoffs started piling up across the industry at companies such as Xbox maker Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts. Seeing many of his new peers let go, he became motivated to lend a hand. Satvat built a website and filled it with a range of free resources tailored for out-of-work game talent. It includes two still-growing lists — one of job postings and another with contact information for hundreds of people he enlisted to provide support, such as résumé reviews and mock interviews. "I was like, what if I made the most comprehensive job listing site ever?" Satvat told Business Insider of his thinking when he got started on the initiative in late 2022. "I'm good at modeling, scraping the internet." Satvat also created a Discord group for the site's users to network with each other and he's given away thousands of tickets to industry events that he acquired by partnering with their organizers. He said he doesn't charge or make any money off his career site, describing it as a purely philanthropic side hustle. Based on user feedback, Satvat said his efforts to date appear to have helped around 3,900 ousted game-industry workers find new jobs, a feat that earned him the inaugural Game Changer award at last year's annual Game Awards show in Los Angeles and this year's Giving Award from the nonprofit Games for Change in New York. Those honors come as the game industry has been grappling with an exceptionally high volume of layoffs. An estimated 37,600 jobs have been shed since 2022, according to an online tally of termination announcements and media reports compiled by Farhan Noor, a technical artist in California. Like employers in many other industries, game companies overhired during the pandemic but other factors have contributed to the cuts, too, such as rising production and marketing costs. Satvat has been a gamer since he was a kid, and by high school, he knew he wanted to work in the industry despite not having artistic inclinations. "I just liked business stuff," he said. But after earning undergraduate and graduate business degrees, he couldn't find any game jobs near where he lived on the East Coast, and staying close to family was a nonnegotiable. "I come from a very tight knit diaspora of a Persian community," he said. Satvat spent several years in business-development roles outside gaming, most recently in a remote one at Amazon's cloud-computing unit. In late 2020, after his first year at Amazon, a colleague introduced him to Ethan Evans, a leader in the company's gaming division. Satvat explained that he was a devoted player of franchises like "World of Warcraft" and "The Legend of Zelda," and the conversation ultimately landed him the kind of job he'd long desired. "It was transparent how much he knew the [game] community and loved it," said Evans, who also didn't start his career in gaming and is now an executive coach. Satvat "wasn't trying to get a promotion. He was trying to move from one thing to another to get closer to something he wanted to do." About a year later, though, Satvat reluctantly resigned from Amazon because the Seattle-based company began mandating in-office attendance, which meant he'd have to relocate. He said he was fortunate to quickly land his current job, a remote business-development position at Chinese game giant Tencent. The person who previously had it reached out over LinkedIn to say he'd just left the company and that Satvat should apply for the role. Satvat later learned that this person found him through mutual LinkedIn connections and was aware of his career site. Now 43, married, and the father of three boys, Satvat works out of his home in Connecticut and continues to spend about 15 to 20 hours every week updating his career site. He also gets help from about 20 volunteers who are aligned with the project's mission of "empowering gamers at every stage of their career." Satvat told BI that it was his successful mid-life pivot to gaming from enterprise software and earlier, healthcare, that made him confident he could become a de facto career guru. When asked for his best advice for job seekers, including those looking to change industries, he pointed to old-fashioned networking. "Spend all your time meeting people," Satvat said. "Every single job I've gotten has been through a relationship."Correction: July 17, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date Satvat met Evans. It was late 2020, not 2021. Jump to

Litigation Partner Brandon Walker Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025.

Title: Tech layoffs 2025: How Microsoft, Google, and Meta are plotting for the AI era

Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Six months into 2025, the tech industry has seen thousands of layoffs as giants such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, IBM, PwC, and Chegg Inc. make sweeping cuts. While AI replacing humans is often cited as the culprit, experts say the reality is more complex: these companies are freeing up capital to hire AI instead. It may seem like a neat distinction—and will undoubtedly be cold comfort to those who lost their jobs—but these experts say that these companies need the funds to make big bets on AI. In part, they’re hiring a new workforce. The tech CEOs who are making the layoff decisions are largely offering a darker worldview, confirming that automation is coming for the white-collar workforce. Microsoft has been at the center of this year’s layoff wave, letting go of nearly 6,000 employees in May, followed by another 9,000 in July—amounting to almost 4% of its global workforce. CEO Satya Nadella has openly discussed the company’s AI transformation, revealing that AI now writes 20% to 30% of Microsoft’s code. This shift has sparked debate about the future need for human engineers, as the company reallocates resources to fund an $80 billion AI infrastructure push this year. Industry experts like Deedy Das of Menlo Ventures argue that the layoffs are less about AI replacing workers and more about freeing up capital for AI investments. Tech commentator Wes Roth echoed the sentiment: “This isn’t about AI replacing humans yet—it’s about restructuring to fund AI initiatives.” Microsoft’s approach is mirrored across the sector, with companies including Amazon flattening management layers and prioritizing technical roles over administrative ones. Das and Roth did not respond to requests for comment. IBM has cut around 8,000 jobs in HR and other departments, as AI tools take over routine administrative tasks. However, the company is simultaneously hiring more engineers and salespeople, signaling a shift toward roles that require creativity and complex decision-making. Google and Meta have also made significant cuts, with Meta laying off 3,600 employees at the start of the year and Google reducing hundreds of roles in its Android, Pixel, and Chrome teams. Both companies cite the need to streamline operations and invest in AI as key reasons. PwC and Chegg Inc. have joined the layoff trend, with PwC cutting approximately 1,500 jobs and Chegg reducing its workforce by 22% as students increasingly turn to free AI-powered study tools. As AI becomes more central to business operations, tech companies are redefining what productivity means. Tech CEOs and thought leaders have been outspoken this year about how AI is reshaping their sector with the unambiguous message that at least some jobs are being fundamentally displaced. There is still a debate about whether they are being eliminated for good. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg said AI could be ready this year to “effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer,” capable of writing code. Andy Jassy said Amazon “will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” while Ford’s Jim Farley and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei separately predicted that AI is set to displace essentially half of all white-collar positions. It’s not all doomsday predictions. Bill Gates see an era of “free intelligence” coming as AI will become capable of handling most tasks. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang said AI will “change everyone’s job — it’s changed mine.” The thousands of tech workers that have been laid off so far in 2025 are watching and waiting.

Title: Top U.S. States With Fewest Layoffs And Strongest Job Stability

ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D. ByBryan Robinson, Ph.D., Contributor. With so much emphasis on massive job layoffs, one group of researchers decided to pinpoint the ... More states with the fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. Many Americans worry on a daily basis about losing their jobs. With over 70K tech layoffs at big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nissan, workers are facing job uncertainty amid persistent volatility of the global labor market—even within some of the world’s most stable and recognizable brands. While labor market volatility is unearthing fears of more layoffs that the American workforce is forced to live with, a new analysis reveals the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs and strongest job stability. These are places job seekers might want to consider if job stability is a priority in their search. Amid massive layoffs, job security and experience are no longer job guarantees, and the uncertainty is affecting the mental health of the American workforce. Experts have offered several ways you can future-proof your job such as how to remain indispensable or build a side hustle as a safety net. But it’s also helpful to know where fewer layoffs and strong job security exist in case you’re willing to relocate to find greater job stability. The online HR platform Techr analyzed state-level layoff data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for April 2025. The researchers calculated layoffs per 100,000 workers, yielding the states with the most job market stability. They ranked the top ten states from fewest layoffs per 100,000 workers to the most layoffs. “By tracking layoffs per 100,000 workers, we get a clearer picture of where job security is strongest and where models of labor strength might be studied and replicated," a spokesperson for Techr comments. 1. Minnesota ranks first with 754 layoffs per 100,000 workers, 33.7% below the national average of 1,137. In April 2025, Minnesota had a workforce of 3,049,400, with just 23,000 layoffs recorded for the month. 2. Colorado is in second position with 770 layoffs per 100,000 workers. According to the researchers, this number represents a 32.2% drop, compared to the national average of 1,137 laborers. In April 2025, Colorado had a total workforce of 2,988,500 with only 23,000 layoffs recorded. 3. Missouri comes in third place with 800 layoffs per 100,000 workers. This figure is 29.6% lower than the national rate of 1,137, the researchers point out. In April 2025, Missouri had a workforce totaling 2,998,600 of which 24,000 employees were laid off. 4. Wisconsin falls into fourth spot with 852 layoffs per 100,000 workers, falling 25.1% below the national average of 1,137 workers, the researchers note. In April 2025, the total workforce in Wisconsin was 3,050,500 with 26,000 layoffs. 5. Washington rounds out the top five states with 873 layoffs per 100,000 workers. The analysts emphasize that this number is 23.2% lower than the national rate of 1,137. In April 2025, Washington had 32,000 layoffs from its 3,664,100 workforce. 6. Iowa is sixth with 876 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, Iowa saw 14,000 layoffs from its 1,598,500 workforce. No percentage is given for its national rating. 7. Massachusetts ranks seventh with 886 layoffs per 100,000 workers. In April 2025, there were 33,000 layoffs in the Massachusetts workforce of 3,725,200. 8. Texas follows with 894 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Texas experienced 128,000 layoffs, more than any other of the top ten states out of a workforce of 14,312,700. 9. Pennsylvania claims ninth spot with 916 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Pennsylvania had 57,000 layoffs out of a workforce of 6,221,400. 10. Hawaii rounds out the top ten with 921 layoffs per 100,000. In April 2025, Hawaii saw 6,000 layoffs from its workforce of 651,400. The results of the Techr study clearly show that Minnesota, Colorado and Missouri are experiencing the most employment stability relative to their workforce size. “These low layoff rates may reflect resilient state economies, steady demand in key sectors or effective labor policies," a Techr representative states, adding that, “It’s a positive signal for job seekers and businesses alike.” It’s also interesting to note that another study ranks Missouri as the number one state with the best work-life balance and Missouri and Minnesota in the top three states where citizens enjoy socializing and relaxing. States on the Techr list that enjoy fewer layoffs also show up on other top lists where freelancers thrive. They include Colorado, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Stable job markets by state are important, especially if you’re job hunting from a national radius. They provides an indication of where resilient state economies lie and can support your search for greater job security than is currently available nationwide. If your mental health is compromised, knowing where stable job markets are could be a factor you use in seeking employment. Stable job security supports mental health stability. If you live and work in one of the top U.S. states with fewest layoffs, consider yourself fortunate. If you don’t and are job searching, the rankings might factor into your decision-making about where you decide to seek employment.

Title: Siemens’ CTO says AI can help address the U.S. manufacturing industry’s big skills gap

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. A key policy goal of President Donald Trump’s administration is bringing jobs back to American factories, though the effort has been mired in a years-long slog despite support from both Democratic and Republican administrations. But even beyond the challenge of getting large, multinational companies to reroute their complex supply chains, there’s a large and unsolved skills gap problem to address even if these U.S. manufacturing jobs were to proliferate. Peter Koerte, the chief technology officer and chief strategy officer at German technology conglomerate Siemens AG, points to research that shows that the average tenure of a U.S. manufacturing worker has slipped from 20 years in 2019 to just 3 years in 2023. “Which means that most of the people that you find—and in particular if we want to bring back manufacturing to the United States—they’re unskilled,” says Koerte. “Because nobody wants to have a factory job.” Official government figures are less dire, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the median tenure of a manufacturing worker dropped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years a decade later. But regardless, manufacturing workers are coming to work each day with a lot less expertise than those who worked similar jobs decades ago. This led Siemens to launch a pilot program in 2024 for an industrial-focused AI copilot, helping engineering teams to search Siemens manuals in natural language to troubleshoot problems on the factory floor. This year, the company expanded the effort by launching an industrial foundational model that was specifically designed for industrial applications. As an example, this AI tool can be used by a worker who is trying to figure out what to do when a machine breaks down. The employee can input information about the machine and the error code that’s on display, and then retrieve detailed instructions on how to address the issue. Less downtime for machines saves factories time and money. The use of AI in this manner also democratizes engineering expertise. “You don’t need to have the very deep domain know-how that prevents you from using those systems,” says Koerte. “It levels the playing field.” Koerte has had a long career at Siemens, joining the company in 2007 as a corporate strategist and taking on several leadership roles before ascending to the CTO and CSO titles in 2020. He says he’s remained at Siemens for such a large portion of his career because he’s inspired by the company’s ability to continually reinvent itself over its 178-year history. Siemens began as a telecommunications company that built the infrastructure that made it possible to send a telegram from London to Calcutta in just 28 minutes, a momentous breakthrough in the mid-1800s. Today, Siemens is known for selling machinery and software that support massive industries including the power and gas sectors, healthcare, and building and freight projects, ranging from supporting a 2,000-kilometer high-speed railway that’s being built in Egypt to an automotive Mercedes-Benz plant in Berlin. The advancement of generative AI presents yet another opportunity for reinvention, says Koerte. Koerte says Siemens was an early adopter of more traditional forms of AI that have been used for many years in manufacturing, including to perform quality inspections or to ensure that buildings are using energy as efficiently as possible. Before the generative AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Siemens had more than 1,500 AI experts on staff. Along that journey, Siemens has embraced a wide variety of AI partners, including heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon Web Services, as well as European-based AI companies and large language model makers in China. Microsoft has been an especially critical partner, Koerte says, offering engineering expertise and insights into how to commercialize the company’s industrial AI offerings. Software development ranks as a high priority use case for generative AI. The company’s software developer workforce of about 27,000 employees have been using AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and the productivity lift from those tools ranges between 10% to 30%, says Koerte. Across the broader workforce, there are 460 distinct AI use cases in production today, a figure that excludes the unique AI chatbots that workers can create to perform tasks through a secure system that’s called SiemensGPT. In total, over 15,000 unique bots have been created by Siemens employees since October 2024. “We have it pretty much everywhere,” says Koerte of AI’s pervasiveness. “The question is, how much have we saved?” That’s not yet completely resolved and most surveys of CTOs and chief information officers show that the return on investment for generative AI projects isn’t as clear as they’d like it to be. But Siemens has set a north star goal. Before the influence of generative AI, the company had an annual productivity gain target of 3% to 4% across the business. But Koerte says with AI, the hope is to double that aspirational range. He believes that parts of the economy that have big skills gaps will reap the most benefits of AI. When Siemens launched an AI-enabled assistant tool to help radiologists detect diseases, the greatest adoption came from underdeveloped countries where there were far fewer specialists. “You always have to look at necessity, where the biggest challenge and necessity is,” says Koerte. “Because then people have to look at it differently. And they have to change.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. AI’s expensive talent war heats up. Google, Meta, and OpenAI are among the AI hyperscalers throwing big bucks to lure lucrative AI talent, as highlighted by Google’s $2.4 billion deal to hire the leaders of AI coding tool Windsurf and pay for the nonexclusive license for the startup’s technology. Days later, Cognition swooped in to buy the rest of Windsurf, though terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. OpenAI was also reportedly in talks with Windsurf, discussions that broke down because of concerns about having to share its products with Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest investor. Separately, OpenAI has lured four top engineers from rivals Tesla, xAI, and Meta; while Bloomberg reports of a $200 million pay package that was given to former Apple engineer Ruoming Pang, who ran the company’s AI models team. Meta has also recently hired more than 10 OpenAI researchers and experts from Anthropic, Google, and other startups, the news outlet reports. AI has an impact on jobs, but just how much? Over the past week, job cuts continued to be attributed to the gains companies are achieving from their investments in AI, with a report from Bloomberg highlighting internal comments from within Microsoft that says AI has saved the tech giant more than $500 million in its call centers alone. Microsoft has also cut about 15,000 employees this year. Meanwhile, roughly 1,300 jobs were cut at job search and employee review companies Indeed and Glassdoor, as parent company Japan’s Recruit Holdings told employees that AI is “changing the world” and that the company must adapt with the evolution of that technology. But CIO Dive reports that outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas’ figures for the first half of 2025 found that only 75 out of 20,000 jobs cut by U.S.-based companies were explicitly attributed to AI (though it notes that the cause of many layoffs may be classified in broader terms). The trade outlet reports that companies are using the term “technological update” more frequently, possibly to avoid negative press of replacing workers with AI. Nvidia hits $4 trillion valuation ahead of CEO’s trip to China. The AI chip maker became the world’s first publicly traded company to hit a $4 trillion market capitalization last week, reflecting an astonishing gain of 1,460% over the past five years. The latest stock market milestone comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang finds himself quite a bit in the news over the past several days, culminating with Monday's news that the U.S. government has lifted restrictions on Nvidia selling its H20 GPUs to China. Huang also recently sat down with CNN, where he was asked about a warning from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white collar jobs within five years. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” says Huang. Meanwhile, struggling chip maker Intel lays off 4,000. Nvidia’s rival Intel, which has lagged in the AI chips race, announced layoffs across four states affecting engineers, researchers, middle management, and factory workers. Last week, The Oregonian reported that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan told employees during an internal broadcast, in response to a question about company culture, that things had gotten so bleak that Intel was “not in the top 10 semiconductor companies.” He added that customers were giving Intel poor marks and cautioned that a turnaround would be a “marathon” that would require some humility. Intel’s market capitalization greatly lags Nvidia at just around $100 billion today. AI agents are proliferating and most companies prefer a mix of internal and off-the-shelf solutions. KPMG’s second-quarter AI pulse survey found that nine out of ten companies are past AI agent experimentation, with 33% fully deploying at least some agents (up from 11% for the past two consecutive quarters), with another 57% of organizations piloting AI agents. “All agents aren’t created equal,” cautions Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG, in an interview with Fortune. “You’re seeing a lot of task agents being deployed, which are more simplified use cases.” With more organizations moving to the piloting or deployment stages, Lohr says the obstacles to make AI agents a reality are becoming more clear, including technical skills gaps (59% surveyed), followed by workforce resistance to change (47%), and system complexity (39%). When it comes to how companies are actually deploying these agentic workflows—which can perform more complex tasks than prompt-based AI chatbots—the Big Four accounting firm says more leaders are planning to deploy a combination of internally built and off-the-shelf agents (up 51% from 27% in the first quarter). Just 2% plan to only build agents internally. Hiring: - EchoStar is seeking a CIO, based in Englewood, Colorado.

Title: A millennial made $300,000 secretly working multiple jobs — while tasked with catching others doing the same

Full Content:
Eric was paid to catch employees secretly working multiple jobs. Then he became one of them. A few years ago, Eric was working in an IT role at a large company. His job responsibilities included investigating three types of "illicit employment" within the organization: workers who outsourced their job responsibilities to overseas contractors, foreign actors who infiltrated companies by posing as legitimate hires, and employees secretly juggling multiple jobs without the company's approval. But there wasn't much suspicious activity to investigate, Eric said, and he was working as little as one hour each day. Then he had an idea: What if he took on a second job to boost his income? While Eric considered it, he initially held back because he was worried about getting caught. But that changed the following year, when his employer asked him to focus more on detecting job jugglers, and he realized just how difficult they were to identify. After weighing the risks, Eric applied for and landed a remote role, bringing his combined annual income to roughly $300,000. He said he worked only a couple of hours a day across the jobs. In addition to the financial benefits, Eric said he took the second job to gain an inside look at the "overemployed" world, one that might help him identify job jugglers. He said the firsthand experience helped him catch several employees who were ultimately fired. But this success came with a growing problem for Eric, one that ultimately cut his job-juggling journey short. He feared the very system he was building to catch others would end up catching him, and jeopardize his career. "It was like being the lead investigator on your own murder," said Eric, whose identity, employment, and income were verified by Business Insider, but who asked to use a pseudonym, citing fears of professional repercussions. "It was a wild time in my life." Eric, a millennial in the US, is among the Americans who have secretly juggled multiple jobs to increase their incomes. Over the past three years, BI has interviewed more than two dozen "overemployed" workers who've used their extra cash to travel the world, buy expensive weight-loss drugs, and pay down student debt. To be sure, holding multiple jobs without employer approval could have professional repercussions and lead to burnout. Additionally, tech layoffs and return-to-office mandates have created obstacles for current and aspiring job jugglers. But many overemployed workers have told BI that the financial benefits have generally outweighed the downsides and risks. ​​Do you have a story to share about secretly working multiple jobs or discovering an employee is doing so?

Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here’s our guide to sharing information securely. Eric never planned for his job juggling to last forever. While his initial concerns about getting caught eased enough for him to accept the second role, he still worried that he'd eventually be exposed. "I thought I could make some money real quick and get out," he said. But Eric feared that if his savings started ballooning because of his two incomes, he'd get "emotionally attached" to the extra earnings, making it harder to walk away. His solution was to spend freely on things he'd normally avoid. He said he viewed job juggling like renting a luxurious car: fun while it lasts, but not something you do forever. "I was ordering stuff off Amazon all the time," he said. "It was like expendable income." In addition to unlocking this spending spree, working multiple jobs gave Eric firsthand insight into how people with multiple roles operated — knowledge that helped him sharpen his detection skills and catch job jugglers. "It really wasn't until after I had my second job that I started getting actionable outcomes from my investigations because I just knew exactly what to look for," he said. Eric said he used internal company activity data to look for behavioral patterns that could suggest someone was juggling multiple jobs, such as sudden swings in productivity during specific parts of the day. Some workers were highly active in the morning and quiet all afternoon, or vice versa. His thinking, based partly on his personal experience, was that job jugglers would split time between their two roles. "I'd go back historically and see that at one point they were working all day and now they're not," he said. "So it just came down to behaviors." When an employee's activity seemed suspicious, Eric said, he'd contact their manager and ask how often the worker appeared on camera during meetings, whether they'd missed any lately, and whether their work quality had declined over time. If concerns persisted, he'd suggest the manager schedule a one-on-one video call during the worker's usual inactive hours. If the employee repeatedly asked to delay or reschedule the call, that would raise red flags, and the case could eventually be handed off to HR. Even as Eric's detection capabilities improved, he wasn't too concerned about his own work behaviors being flagged, he said. But that changed when he discovered that a security software program used by both of his employers could detect when multiple devices were running the software on the same home network — an indicator someone could be juggling multiple jobs. While he wasn't certain it would expose him, the realization made him nervous. At the same time, he was having mixed feelings about the ethics of overemployment. So, after less than a year of working two jobs, Eric decided to drop one of his roles. "As I went further and further along, I realized I couldn't keep this up because I was building detections that were going to catch me," he said. While overemployment has become more common because of the rise of remote work, Eric said he doesn't think most companies are particularly concerned about it. His detection work occasionally comes up during job interviews, and from what he's gathered, employers generally believe job jugglers will either drop a job after burning out or reaching a financial goal, or be let go for underperformance. If catching overemployed workers isn't a big priority for most companies, many job jugglers may be able to avoid detection, at least in the short term. Eric said that looking back, he sometimes wonders whether he could have kept going a little longer. "I just felt like I was going to get caught, and I didn't want to lose my entire career, so I had to stop," he said. "But man, I kind of regret it sometimes. It was really good money." Jump to

Title: "Everybody's jobs will be affected" — but NVIDIA's CEO believes society can think its way out of AI-related job loss

It's going to take every bit of society's ingenuity to save our jobs from the machines. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating and terrifying subject. While AI brings positive gains for our little planet we call home, there's also a good chance it will cause massive unrest as it gets smarter and becomes a much better employee than you or I. Besides the ever more frequent reports of significant layoffs and outright job losses in the wake of AI's rise, the heads of many of the leading AI firms are also sounding the alarm. But is the situation as bad as some of AI's most powerful players are making it out to be? NVIDIA is currently the hottest commodity on the AI market right now, as its chips are the ones that everyone wants powering their AI models. NVIDIA recently became the first $4 trillion company, made possible largely by the ongoing AI race. That gives NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's comments on AI a lot of weight. Huang was recently interviewed by CNN's Fareed Zakaria, in which Huang expressed a bit of optimism alongside some pessimism about AI and the impact it's having on jobs (via Tom's Hardware). All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. "If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translate to job loss," said Huang, as he responded to a question about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's current outlook on job replacement. "The fundamental thing is this: do we have more ideas left in society? And if we do, if we’re more productive, we’ll be able to grow." Huang is, of course, responding here to Amodei's opinion that AI could slash up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs. The quote (via Axios) from Anthropic's Amodei doesn't sugar-coat the current outlook for the future: "We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming. It's a very strange set of dynamics, where we're saying: 'You should be worried about where the technology we're building is going." Reading through this battle of words, it doesn't seem like Huang is exactly debating Amodei's idea that AI could push employment rates beyond what we've ever seen. Instead, Huang believes that the workforce, just like it has done plenty of times in the past during technological revolutions, will endure on the back of our ingenuity. Huang reminds us that "even in the era of computers," there has been a rise in productivity and employment. "Everybody's jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created, and what I hope is that the productivity gains that we see in all the industries will lift society," said Huang. This isn't the first time that Huang has responded to Amodei's beliefs in a public manner. Huang, in a previous interview at VivaTech 2025, stated: "I pretty much disagree with almost everything he [Amodei] says. He thinks AI is so scary, but only they should do it." Huang and Amodei are far from the only significant AI figures spreading the same ideas. Bill Gates has said that he believes generative AI will eventually be able to take over traditional human roles in the workplace, leaving us, organic beings, useless for most things. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that he believes entire job sectors will go extinct as AI continues to grow, while Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has stated that he believes coding jobs could be gone within two years. I certainly see where these CEOs are coming from; their technology has the potential to completely rewrite human progress, and they don't want to be skewered for negative fallout when it does. However, on the other side of the argument, these CEOs could be using this doom-and-gloom strategy as a marketing tool. There is little risk to CEOs making grandiose predictions of job cuts that will appease shareholders, given that even if these claims are untrue that there won't be much public backlash. How everything plays out remains to be seen, but Huang's opinion that all jobs will be affected doesn't seem too far off. A 2024 Adecco Group study on 2,000 C-Suite executives from around the world demonstrates that 41% of those polled believe they will employ fewer humans within five years because of AI. Only 46% of executives asked say they plan to move human workers replaced by AI to new roles. So, what jobs will those displaced by AI take on? I don't have an answer, but Huang believes that we, as a society will figure it out. Worried about your job? Just think harder!

Title: Coding has emerged as genAI’s killer use case. But what if its benefits are a mirage?

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Hello and welcome to Eye on AI…In this edition: Meta is going big on data centers…the EU publishes its code of practice for general purpose AI and OpenAI says it will abide by it…the U.K. AI Security Institute calls into question AI “scheming” research. The big news at the end of last week was that OpenAI’s plans to acquire Windsurf, a startup that was making AI software for coding, for $3 billion fell apart. (My Fortune colleague Allie Garfinkle broke that bit of news.) Instead, Google announced that it was hiring Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan and cofounder Douglas Chen and a clutch of other Windsurf staffers, while also licensing Windsurf’s tech—a deal structured similarly to several other big tech-AI startup not-quite-acquihire acquihires, including Meta’s recent deal with Scale AI, Google’s deal with Character.ai last year, as well as Microsoft’s deal with Inflection and Amazon’s with Adept. Bloomberg reported that Google is paying about $2.4 billion for Windsurf’s talent and tech, while another AI startup, Cognition, swooped in to buy what was left of Windsurf for an undisclosed sum. Windsurf may have gotten less than OpenAI was offering, but OpenAI’s purchase reportedly fell apart after OpenAI and Microsoft couldn’t agree on whether Microsoft would have access to Windsurf’s tech.The increasingly fraught relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft is worth a whole separate story. So too is the structure of these non-acquisition acquihires—which really do seem to blunt any legal challenges, either from regulators or the venture backers of the startups. But today, I want to talk about coding assistants. While a lot of people debate the return on investment from generative AI, the one thing seemingly everyone can agree on is that coding is the one clear killer use case for genAI. Right? I mean, that’s why Windsurf was such a hot property and why Anyshphere, the startup behind the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at close to $10 billion. And GitHub Copilot is of course the star of Microsoft’s suite of AI tools, with a majority of customers saying they get value out of the product. Well, a trio of papers published this past week complicate this picture. METR, a nonprofit that benchmarks AI models, conducted a randomized control trial involving 16 developers earlier this year to see if using code editor Cursor Pro integrated with Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 models, actually improved their productivity. METR surveyed the developers before the trial to see if they thought it would make them more efficient and by how much. On average, they estimated that using AI would allow them to complete the assigned coding tasks 24% faster. Then the researchers randomized 246 software coding tasks, either allowing them to be completed with AI or not. Afterwards, the developers were surveyed again on what impact they thought the use of Cursor had actually had on the average time to complete the tasks. They estimated that it made them on average 20% faster. (So maybe not quite as efficient as they had forecast, but still pretty good.) But, and now here’s the rub, METR found that when assisted by AI it actually took the coders 19% longer to finish tasks.What’s going on here? Well, one issue was that the developers, who were all highly experienced, found that Cursor could not reliably generate code as good as theirs. In fact, they accepted less than 44% of the code-generated responses. And when they did accept them, three-quarters of the developers felt the need to still read over every line of AI-generated code to check it for accuracy, and more than half of the coders made major changes to the Cursor-written code to clean it up. This all took time—on average 9% of the developers time was spent reviewing and cleaning up AI-generated outputs. Many of the tasks in the METR experiment involved large code bases, sometimes consisting of over 100,000 lines of code, and the developers found that sometimes Cursor made strange changes in other parts of this code base that they had to catch and fix. But why did the developers think the AI was making them faster when in fact it was slowing them down? And why, when the researchers followed up with the developers after the experiment ended, did they discover that 69% of the coders were continuing to use Cursor?Some of it seems to be that despite the time it took to edit the Cursor-generated code, the AI assistance did actually ease the cognitive burden for many of the coders. It was mentally easier to fix the AI-generated code than to have to puzzle out the right solution from scratch. So is the perceived ROI from “vibe coding” itself just vibes? Perhaps. That would actually square with what the Wall Street Journal noted about a different area of genAI use—lawyers using genAI copilots. The newspaper reported that a number of law firms found that given how long it took to fact-check AI-generated legal research, they were not sure lawyers were actually saving any time using the tools. But when they surveyed lawyers, especially junior lawyers, they all reported high satisfaction using the AI copilots and that they felt it made their jobs more enjoyable.But a couple of other studies from last week suggest that maybe it all depends on exactly how you use AI coding assistance. A team from Harvard Business School and Microsoft looked at two years of observations of software developers using GitHub Copilot (which is Microsoft product) and found that those using the tool spent more time on coding and less time on project management tasks, in part because GitHub Copilot allowed them to work independently instead of having to use large teams. It also allowed the coders to spend more time exploring possible solutions to coding problems and less time actually implementing the solutions. This too might explain why coders enjoy using these AI tools—because it allows them to spend more time on parts of the job they find intellectually interesting— even if it isn’t necessarily about overall time-savings. Finally, let’s look at the third study, which is from researchers at Chinese AI startup Modelbest, Chinese universities BUPT and Tsinghua University, and the University of Sydney. They found that while individual AI software development tools often struggled to reliably complete complicated tasks, the results improved markedly when multiple large language models were prompted to each take on a specific role in the software development process and to pose clarifying questions to one another aimed at minimizing hallucinations. They called this architecture “ChatDev.” So maybe there’s a case to be made that the problem with AI coding assistants is how we are using them, not anything wrong with the tech itself? Of course, building teams of AI agents to work in the way ChatDev suggests also uses up a lot more computing power, which gets expensive. So maybe we’re still facing that question: is the ROI here a mirage? With that, here’s more AI news.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the Trump administration is set to reverse course and ease export restrictions on the company’s H20 AI chip, with deliveries to resume soon. Nvidia also introduced a new AI chip for the Chinese market that complies with current U.S. rules, as Huang visits Beijing in a diplomatic push to reassure customers and engage officials. While China is encouraging buyers to adopt local alternatives, companies like ByteDance and Alibaba continue to prefer Nvidia’s offerings due to their superior performance and software ecosystem. Nvidia’s stock and that of TSMC, which makes the chips for Nvidia, jumped sharply on the news. Read more from the Financial Times here. Zuckerberg confirms Meta will spend hundreds of billions in data center push. In a Threads post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company is spending “hundreds of billions of dollars” to build massive AI-focused data centers, including one called Prometheus set to launch in 2026. The data centers are part of a broader push toward developing artificial general intelligence or “superintelligence.” Read more from Bloomberg here. OpenAI and Mistral say they will sign EU code of practice for general-purpose AI. The EU published its code of practice last week for general-purpose AI systems under the EU AI Act, about two months later than initially expected. Adhering to the code, which is voluntary, gives companies assurance that they are in compliance with the Act. The code imposes a stringent set of public and government reporting requirements on frontier AI model developers, requiring them to provide a wealth of information about their models’ design and testing to the EU’s new AI Office. It also requires public transparency around the use of copyrighted materials in the training of AI systems. You can read more about the code of practice from Politico here. Many had expected the big technology vendors and AI companies to form a united front in opposing the code—Meta and Google had previously attacked drafts of it, claiming it imposed too great a burden on tech firms—but OpenAI said in a blog post Friday that it would sign up to the standards. Mistral, the French AI model developer, also said it would sign—although it had previously asked the EU to delay enforcement of the AI Act, whose provisions on general-purpose AI are set to come into force on August 2nd. That may up the pressure on other AI companies to agree to comply too. Report: AWS is testing a new cloud service to make it easier to use third-party AI models. That’s according to a story in The Information, which says Amazon cloud service AWS is making the move after losing business from several AI startups to Google Cloud. Some customers complained it was too difficult to tap models from OpenAI and Google, which are hosted on other clouds, from within AWS. Amazon mulls further multi-billion dollar investment in Anthropic. That’s according to a story in the Financial Times. Amazon has already invested $8 billion in Anthropic and the two companies have formed an ever-closer alliance, with Anthropic working with Amazon on several massive new data centers and helping it develop its next generation Trainium2 AI chips. Could all those studies about scheming AI be faulty? That’s the suggestion of a new paper out from a group of researchers at the U.K. government’s AI Security Institute. The paper, called “Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language” examines recent claims that advanced AI models engage in deceptive or manipulative behavior—what AI Safety researchers call “scheming.” Drawing an analogy to 1970s research about whether non-human primates were capable of using language—which ultimately were found to have overstated the depth of linguistic capacity that chimpanzees possess—the authors argue that the AI scheming literature suffers from similar flaws. Specifically, the researchers say the AI scheming research suffers from an over-interpretation of anecdotal behavior, a lack of theoretical clarity, an absence of rigorous controls, and a reliance on anthropomorphic language. They caution that current studies often confuse AI systems following human-provided instructions with intentional deception and may exaggerate the implications of observed behaviors. While acknowledging that scheming could pose future risks, the authors call for more scientifically robust methodologies before drawing strong conclusions. They offer concrete recommendations, including clearer hypotheses, better experimental controls, and more cautious interpretation of AI behavior. The world’s best AI models operate in English.

AI is not going to save the news media. I’ve been thinking a lot about AI’s impact on the news media lately both because it happens to be the industry I’m in and also because Fortune has recently started experimenting more with using AI to produce some of our basic news stories. (I use AI a bit to produce the short news blurbs for this newsletter too, although I don’t use it to write the main essay.) Well, Jason Koebler, a cofounder of tech publication 404 Media, has an interesting essay out this week on why he thinks many media organizations are being misguided in their efforts to use AI to produce news more efficiently.He argues that the media’s so-called “pivot to AI” is a mirage—a desperate, misguided attempt by executives to appear forward-thinking while ignoring the structural damage AI is already inflicting on their businesses. He argues that many news execs are imposing AI on newsrooms with no clear business strategy beyond vague promises of innovation. He says this approach won't work: relying on the same tech that's gutting journalism to save it is both delusional and self-defeating. Instead, he argues, the only viable path forward is to double down on what AI can’t replicate: trustworthy, personality-driven, human journalism that resonates with audiences. AI may offer productivity boosts at the margins—transcripts, translations, editing tools—but these don't add up to a sustainable model. You can read his essay here. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

InfoQ Homepage Presentations From Junior to Staff and Beyond: Lessons Learned Bruno Rey shares insights from 17 years in tech, including his 15-year journey to staff engineer. He explains strategies for individual career growth - ambition, focus, and opportunity - and offers guidance for leaders on fostering team development. Learn to navigate the tech career ladder and empower others. Bruno Rey is a Staff Engineer at Eventbrite. With over 15yrs of experience in software development, he's worked at companies large and small with broad experience in different positions such as QA, Sales and Solutions Architect. Outside of work he's a century cyclist, musician, audiophile hobbyist and a father of two. Software is changing the world. QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Rey: I started coding in 1999. I was 12 years old at the time. That was the first programming book that I read cover to cover. That was my first programming language (Visual Basic). It's not very popular today, but today I have no shame in saying it. I've been working professionally in tech for 17 years, working since I had my first full-time job at a serious company. It took me 15 years to become a staff engineer, which is my current role at Eventbrite. You might think 15 years to become a staff engineer is a long time, and you're right, that's a problem. That's hopefully what will not happen to you if you listen to this talk, and how you can help others grow faster as well. This talk is for those who want to grow in their career, who want to climb that ladder, but it's also for those who want to help others grow. We're going to discuss growth, basically. We're going to discuss the ladder. I expect most of the people to be on the second part, but there might also be some on the first part. Again, the topics are the same, so there's really no difference. I thought a lot about what drives growth. I also did a lot of research. I also talked to a lot of people preparing for this talk. What I came up with in order is that, the first factor, and probably the most important one, is ambition. It's really hard to grow in your career if you don't have that ambition. In second place, I find that capacity is important. Being able to perform, being able to learn new things, all of that. In third place, you might be very good at both. You might be excellent at your job, but you need an external factor. You need that opportunity. There's nowhere for you to grow. It's really hard to do that. The reason why I put ambition first instead of capacity or curiosity, or whatever, becomes really clear when you think about the definition of ambition. The one I like from the Oxford Dictionary says that ambition is a strong desire to achieve something, typically requiring determination, effort, and drive. If you read between the lines, what this is telling you is that a person with ambition will be able to develop that capacity as needed. They will do that through determination, effort, and drive. They will learn whatever they need to learn. I want you to put yourselves, for a moment, in the shoes of a person who's very early on their career, just starting, just accepting their new job. Probably the company offered them a position and told them, "Yes, this company is growing. You're going to grow really fast. It's going to be great for you". Things don't always go that way. Sometimes we find that the first years of our career look more like this. This is very typical. It's not terrible, but if you want to accelerate growth, you should try to avoid this. You should start by identifying the problems. What is causing this type of growth in your career that's not really fast because it's not really directed? Typically, it's one of two things. It's either a lack of focus on execution or a lack of direction. When we go to high school and college, they tell us that we should strive for perfection. You want to have that perfect grade. You want to have that perfect opinion from your teachers about your work. As soon as you get into business, you need to completely change your mindset. Perfection is the killer of execution. This is very well put in the Amazon Leadership Principles as bias for action. That's one that I really like. In the early years of someone's career, it's very important to help them make this shift of mind, make this shift of paradigm, and to start focusing on execution over perfection, without dropping quality, of course. Secondly, if someone is having trouble finding their direction, there are ways to help them. The best thing is for them to do research first on their own. Then, the second turn, to seek for mentoring. When I talk about research, you can read a book and you can read a blog, that's good. You should also do your own research. If you think, I want to be a staff engineer in five years, or I want to be a manager, you should look probably within your company and ask yourself, what does a manager's life look like? What does a staff engineer do? How do these people work? How did they get there? Is that really what I want for my life? That's the type of research that will bring things a bit more down to earth and make them more achievable. You should also look at blogs and books to get the theory behind that. Again, when someone is coming out of college, seeing things in the real world makes a real difference. It's important to do that part as well. Again, put yourself in the shoes of someone who's early in their career and they're having trouble growing. Typically, they ask themselves, why are we not growing? What's happening? Many people will come up with these answers. The market is terrible right now. I miss the golden era. We all did. There's always some nostalgia to some golden era that never existed, really. That doesn't matter. This can be real, but they can also be seen as just excuses. There are also people who will come up with these types of responses, "I haven't been directing my efforts efficiently, or, I have poor time management skills". If you look at it, these ones on the right hint much more introspection and sound much more personal. The ones that I put here are real life examples from people close to me, from people I've mentored, and even some of my own. This is a very popular framework. Some of you might have recognized it already. This is known as the victim-player framework. Essentially, what it says is that what you cannot control makes you weak, but what you can control makes you powerful. We have the idea, mostly when we're young, to think about showing weaknesses is what makes me weak. In real life, it's quite the opposite, showing your weaknesses is what makes you strong. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail on the victim-player framework. I'm going to give the quintessential example of it, which is how two different people might react to a traffic jam. One employee can say, "It's a very big problem. It was totally unpredictable. There is nothing I can do now. I'm just stuck here". An ideal employee would probably call their boss and tell them, "Boss, I'm sorry. I had a big problem today. I'm at a traffic jam. I'm going to have to take the first call from my car. I hope that's not a problem. I can stay up and make some extra time today if necessary. Also, I've realized that this is a recurring pattern, and I've already made a decision to start taking the train instead, because it's becoming unacceptable". This is someone taking ownership of that situation. Of course, this is a very typical example, but in real life, you know how it goes. This is also very similar to other concepts. They're all the same thing. It's also called being proactive or taking agency, not being the victim. It's the same thing. It changes over time. The concepts are slightly different, but they're all aimed at taking control of what you can, essentially. I mentioned I included a couple of my own here. Today, I have no shame in saying that. I'm not ashamed of my first programming language, which you already know. I started working when I was 20. Early on in my career, I noticed that I was having issues with my work. Mostly, it was very hard for me to have a meeting with people outside of my company because my social anxiety was terrible. It's really hard for me to speak publicly here today. Also, I couldn't execute anything over a long period of time. Obviously, I was job hopping a lot, which is sometimes normal in the early stage of your career. When I was 23, I was doing a lot of introspection, and I had the good luck of having a great manager at the time who provided me with a safe place where I could feel confident talking to him. It took me a lot of time. I didn't have the tools at the time to identify this. It took me three years. When I did, I came up to him one day and told him, "I think my depression is setting me back". He told me, "Yes". However, his response was great. After that, we came up with a plan together. He spent months working with me in order for me to get better. I'm better today. He continued to make sure that I felt safe at work and that there wouldn't be any retaliation or anything. He took care of the projects. He paired me with some other people and everything. He was a great guy, Gustavo. Shortly after this, there was a meeting at a bar with work colleagues. Someone else got a promotion. Of course, I didn't because I was doing terrible. This was back in the day when we worked at offices and we had to wear suits and everything. This was a very traditional company. This person had bought a new suit and came to the bar. Someone told him, you look great. Someone else said, a man who takes care of himself is a man who can take care of others. That phrase at that time really resonated with me because that's when it hit me, like, how am I expected to lead a team if I cannot put my own life back together? I talked about that a lot with my boss at the time. I got my shit together, basically. That started working better. If you think about my manager's reaction at the time and why he helped me, it wasn't just because he's a great guy, which he is. It was also in the best interest of the company. When people don't grow, many people will blame their company for their bad career path. They will say, the company is holding me back and things like that. Truth is, companies usually don't do that. It's very rare for a company to do that. It's in the best interest of a company for their employees to do well, to thrive. They will help you. Companies don't want to deal with low-performing employees. Companies don't want to put you on a performance improvement plan or anything like that. It's very expensive for the company to do that. It's more profitable to have employees who are doing well. Managers are expected to help them do well in order to achieve that, in order to have a well-functioning team that starts providing value, at a good pace. Once I made that click, that's when my career really took off. That's when I really started growing. I had good mentoring. I was lucky to have that. The best advice I got was to keep it at your own pace and keep it consistent. A very typical example for this is comparing the workplace to physical exercise. It's easy to go out running for 10 minutes. Most people can do that. It's really hard to do that consistently two or three times a week, or once a day for one year, two years, or five years. Will you go out every day? Will you go out even when you have a congestion? Experts say that it's totally fine. Will you go out even on the cold days, when it's raining, when it's snowing? I don't run as much. I cycle a lot. That day was cold, my friends. I can tell you that. This sounds very obvious when we talk about exercise. For many people, it's not so obvious when we talk about our professional career, and it should be. It should be just the same. It's really obvious when you really think about it. When you plan for your career growth, you should acknowledge that you will have highs and lows, and that you will have good days and bad days. That your ambition is important only up to a level, and you should not overdo it. I talked a lot about me during the time from the perspective of someone who is growing. From the perspective of a manager or a leader who's helping someone, we should also identify that. That person who tries to run a marathon on day one. That person who attempts to lift 100 pounds on day one. That's totally impossible, of course. In the work environment, it's sometimes quite obvious as well. Think about that person who only cares about the title specifically or their salary. That person who doesn't care about the project, doesn't care about the company. Especially the person who doesn't care about the team, who doesn't empathize with the human beings around them. That person is a ticking time bomb to any team. They might be good in the short term, they might put out good work or whatever, but that will be very bad for your team and for the company in the longer term. There's a great talk on this topic by Simon Sinek called, "Performance vs Trust". The way he puts it basically, if you put trust in one axis and performance on the other one, performance being how much work they output and trust being how much trust they inspire to their colleagues, to their teammates, of course, nobody wants these folks, and of course, everybody wants these ones. The way he frames it is that you should choose always people from this category over people from this category. It sounds obvious, but sadly in the workspace, it's not so obvious all the time. There's a reason. He goes on to saying that promotion cycles typically tend to favor these individuals. The reason for that being that promotion cycles should be objective and they should be based on real hard data. It's easy to measure performance, but it's really hard to measure trust. How much trust does a colleague inspire? How much do they empower their team to be better just by feeling safe? It's hard to do that. This was called out on the keynote by Lizzie. TAPPs is one framework to do that, there are many others. It's one way to measure it. The truth is, this can be measured and this can be measured as well. It's not impossible. It's more costly and you should do that investment in order to find these folks. The people from this category can be grown into being here in the short-term or in the mid-term. If you find someone here, it's almost impossible to get them here. That was also mentioned by Charlotte. It's really hard to change the character of a person. You can change their capacity. You can help them grow. You can teach them things, but you cannot change who they are. We're going to talk about a few more concrete growth strategies. The first thing I'd like to mention for this is that, any employee attempting to grow should understand the roles and expectations of their company. There's a lot of resources online to do this. Levels.fyi is a great page. There are public career ladders that you can look up. Eventbrite has given me the permission to make our own career ladder public for the purpose of this talk. You can look it up later. There will be links at the end. I'm not going to go through the career ladders here. It's a very big topic. If you're interested in growing, please do your research. There's a lot of interesting resources on this topic. On strategies, I think one of the most important ones is to keep perspective in mind. When you're working on your day-to-day, you should be asking yourself, what is best for me? What is best for my team? What is best for our customers? Also, what is best for my company? This is ambitious for someone who's just starting on their career. They're not going to change their company on day one, of course, but having that perspective is important, understanding how their work connects to their company goals. You should also ask, how and why? How does my company's business model operate? Why is my team focusing on this project in this quarter? Things like that. Why am I being asked to prioritize this task over this other one, which I feel is more important? If you have that ambitious perspective, if you understand your leaders, you will be able to grow faster in your career. This was also mentioned by Dan, on aligning your goals with your leaders' goals. Another strategy, of course, is to find your role models. This is probably the most popular ones. There should always be people you look up to, people you admire. You should try to work with them. Maybe observe how they work. See what they do that you cannot do as well yet. You can approach them and ask them how they learned it, how they built the skill, and how you can build it. They might recommend that you read a book or that you pick up a habit. Maybe you can just ask them to mentor you. Ideally, these are people inside your company, but they can also be people from outside as well. Another thing you should do, of course, is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. We all have strengths and weaknesses. We should do that introspection to try to identify them, but that should always be validated externally because we all have blind spots. That external input is super valuable. As mentors, as leaders, we should make sure that those are clear as well. We should have those uncomfortable conversations with someone. Tell them, your tickets are terrible, you never put enough information. Or, you're not testing your changes and the team has to cover you all the time with tests. Things like that. Sometimes people don't do this knowingly because they're lazy. Or sometimes they're just not aware of it because it's one of their blind spots. If you don't discuss it with them, it's quite unfair to judge them on it. You should make sure that those are clear and discussed always. Of course, you don't have to be good at everything. I really like this type of chart. This was made popular by soccer, particularly soccer video games. It's great at showing how different people have different strengths and weaknesses, and they all come together to form a team that does well. In this case, they don't play together. That's not the point. That's actual feedback given to me in 2020. I remember really being appreciative of the manager who gave me this feedback. It was so visible, so tangible. Like saying, "You're having great productive impact. Your throughput is awesome, but you're doing a lot of rework. You need to work on that. You need to improve that so that I can promote you". This type of feedback is really valuable. As we grow in our career also, things like the playground opens a bit and things become more vague. This was mentioned in the ambiguous role of a principal as well. As a staff, you can choose where you want to put your effort. You can choose to be an architect, but you don't really need to choose only one archetype, as he phrases it. You can choose to be the solver who sometimes acts as a tech lead, or you can shift your time 50-50 between being a tech lead and the right hand. Those are all valuable. There are no rules on how to act. You should find your own place by finding your strengths and finding what your team needs and what your company needs, and how you can apply those strengths. On the next topic, you should always know yourself and acknowledge that you will have highs and lows. Nobody is perfect. It's important that even at your lows, you find ways in which you can stay productive and in which you can stay valuable to your team and to the company. Coming back to strengths and weaknesses, it's important to act on improving your weaknesses, but also, you should maximize your strengths. If you focus on what you're strong in, what comes naturally to you, that's what you should do when you're going through a low. "This work is easy for me, I'm going to focus on this while I'm here, because that's how I can be valuable to the team. Once I'm better, I'm going to focus on fixing my weaknesses and everything, and that'll be ok. Right now, I'm going to focus on what's easy". You should discuss it with your manager, of course, to make sure that he's aligned. You should be open if you're going through a low. Another thing is what energizes you and what drains you. A typical example is social interactions. Human beings are social beings by nature. We need that oxytocin. We need that serotonin. Different brains need them at different levels. Some people get them at work, and some people don't. Some people, when they go through a technical topic, a really difficult challenge, they need to discuss that challenge with someone else. After discussing it, they come out energized off the meeting and are more productive for the following hours. A bunch of other people come out of the meeting totally drained and need some time to recuperate. That's perfectly fine. Another example is how people act under pressure. Typically, this is during incidents. I am the type of person that's energized by an incident. I'm fueled by it. I love the team that comes together, the strong dedication and collaboration. Some people just loathe it. They don't like working under pressure, and they like to pace their work more slowly. As a recent example, a short time ago, me and a colleague, another staff engineer, we were both transferred from one team to another. That basically creates a lull. The whole team starts forming, storming, norming, performing again, and we were both out of our domain. We didn't know what we were doing, basically. The other guy goes to our manager and says, "I'm going to take it slow. I'm going to take my time to learn. I'm not going to be productive during the time that I'm learning, but that's going to make me more productive in the future, and I think it's a good investment". The manager says, "That's great. Thank you". I come up to the manager and I tell him, "I need that feedback. I need this action. I'm going to take the on-call for a while. Let me deal with the incidents. That's how I can be valuable to the team fast. That's how I can provide value with what I know. Also, that's a way for me to learn fast". The manager says, "That's perfect. Thank you". He was very appreciative that we were both open about our strengths and weaknesses and that we found ways in which to apply them to the team. Two different persons, two different approaches, both were perfectly valid, the right one for each person. Let's talk a bit about opportunities. It's very important to recognize opportunities and to know how to act on them. The typical opportunity, the ideal one, like the Holy Grail, is company growth. Of course, if a company is growing, they will shape up new teams. There will be opportunity for you to grow within them. Another opportunity is an open position above you. If a tech lead or a manager leaves the team or leaves a company, that position is open, and you can offer yourself to fill it. That's sometimes a double-blade sword because there's typically a reason why they left the company. You should make sure that whichever challenges they were facing at the time are challenges that you can deal with better than them, if those were the reasons why he left. It's typically good to discuss that with the person who's leaving instead of with the people who remain around you. Another opportunity is challenging times. This is the most difficult one, maybe. A lot of companies have been through layoffs lately, and that can create opportunity for growth, even as challenging as it is. There is the concept of anti-fragile. The typical example is in the film Superman vs. Batman, where we have Doomsday: each time you hit him, he becomes stronger. A flower vase is fragile, if you hit it, it breaks. Doomsday, you hit him and he becomes stronger. As an employee, some people, when they get hit through going through a challenging time, they come out stronger. Those people are super valuable to a company, and it's really hard to find them. It's one way in which you can change a challenging time into being an opportunity. Finally, if you don't have opportunities, you should try to create them. You can propose initiatives for your company or for your team. You can maybe ask to be transferred to another team or choose to leave the company. Or you can do things outside of your day job, like coming to a conference, for example. This topic of creating your own opportunities was perfectly covered by Pablo, on finding your dinosaurs. I suggest you look that up as well. Another thing you should do if you want growth is to find ways to make your work be visible. The first thing, you should always keep a track of your work. When you're beginning your career, this might sound unnecessary, but once you've worked 5, 10, 15 years, it becomes really hard to remember what you were doing 2, 3 years ago. Sometimes it's good to keep a document. Julia Evans has a great article on this. It's called the brag document, where you brag about your own work. This is also very valuable when companies are going through change. Typically, your manager can change, sometimes in the same year, you have two or three managers, and they lose that context of what you've done. It's very hard to transfer that from one manager to another. It's much easier for them if you provide them with a brag document, where they can track that work with a paper trail. Another thing is to publish your work. This topic was also covered by Pablo. Make sure that your contributions are seen. Aaron Francis has a great article on this, publishing your work, and how it increases your luck. Finally, let's talk about leaders for a bit. Once you've grown, what can you expect? When we think about staff engineers and principal engineers, one way to define them is how they can impact a large group, like broader than a team, and sometimes how they can impact an entire company. One way we typically do that is setting guidelines on how the company should work, or how the team should work, or the pillar, or whatever you call it in your company. You can work in establishing team boundaries and structures. You can work to define the software development life cycle: how we do PRs, how we do testing. Giuliano from Mercado Libre mentioned at QCon, absolute freedom is not good for companies. We should give the teams those guidelines, and we as leaders should be the ones doing that. Also, we should strive to identify when there are new patterns or new necessities. Once we have set those guidelines, something can fall through the cracks between them, and some team might choose to go on their own path. At Eventbrite, the way we approach this is by setting a golden path. We don't have a strict guideline on what teams can do. We give them a golden path, and we say, if you use these technologies and this software development life cycle, your life will be easy. We will take care of your problems for you. If you choose to strive out of that, you're on your own. You're a lone wolf. You need to take care of your own infra, your own platform, and everything. It's not forbidden, but it'll be more work for your team. One thing that we need to do is to maintain that. One team might be a lone wolf, but if we have two, three, four, five teams doing the same thing, it's not lone wolves, it's now a new pack. We need to put them back into the golden path by saying, this pattern that you're using is now part of a golden path because we see it becoming a new necessity that our company will have. Another thing is that when we grow to become leaders, you remember that person looking up to their leaders? Once you become this person, you are the person they look up to. Your work must not only be good anymore. Your work must be exemplary because people will look up to you. They will imitate you. They will copy how you work. Sometimes we feel that given our growth, we have great judgment, and we know when to cut corners, which changes we can push without testing, or whatever, which risks we can take, which corners we can cut. We do have that judgment, and we can make those calls, but we should be very cautious. It might be best not to make them only for the sake of being exemplary. If you choose to do that, some people might imitate you and choose to start cutting corners at their own judgment, and their judgment might be not as good as yours. That creates a challenge for the company. It's best if you choose to never cut corners so that you instill that way of working in your company, because it permeates into company culture without you knowing it. You should always be aware of that when you're a leader. Finally, and most importantly, we must stand for our peers and subordinates when we feel like they're being treated unfairly. Sometimes, as team leads or tech leads, we see how things operate within a team, and someone from above might not have that visibility, and unfairly blame someone for something that wasn't really their fault. It's our job to come up to them and tell them, "You're misunderstanding the situation. This person was not at fault here. There was a fault at the process. We should look into that instead of blaming the person". Remember, be ambitious, stay focused, be efficient, find your opportunities, and most importantly, take care of yourselves. Participant 1: I feel like when you grow in your career, you take on tasks which you didn't really do when you were more junior. It's like novel tasks. Have you seen opportunities, if you look back at your career, on how to maybe develop those skills when you don't necessarily have a chance to put them in practice? Rey: Yes, it's hard. It's good to try to jump the gun, and be ready before those necessities come. It's good to try to develop those necessities for yourself. I think it comes back to the early part of my talk, not aim for perfection, and aim for execution instead. I will not focus on what I will need in the future, I will focus on what I need today, and start being great at that. Once you have that covered, you can start looking into that. Without having the actual necessity and without having the opportunity to apply that in a productive environment, it becomes really hard to develop that on your own. The obvious way to do it is for tech skills, try to have some pet projects or whatever on the side that you can test new technologies or whatever. I wouldn't put too much effort into developing something that you might or might not need. If you were to do that, I would frame it like looking at your role models and looking at how they work. Because you can confirm that those are skills that are actually needed in your company. How do you develop them? The best thing to do is to ask them directly how you can develop those skills. Participant 2: As you mentioned, someone got hit, but then they got stronger. Do you think you're that kind of person, or what traits does this person have? Rey: I cannot tell you which kind of traits this person has. I sometimes can identify them, but I cannot put it into words yet. It's not a skill that I have developed. I wouldn't say that I'm that type of person all the time, but I have had opportunities where I came out stronger off a challenging situation. My whole team was let go at once and I was the only member who remained there. That was very challenging, but it was also very accelerating to my career growth. I think anybody has the capacity to do that, given the right environment. Environments, when they're challenging, people around us can help us to mitigate that challenge and come out stronger. Participant 3: What made you change teams and what advice would you give to someone considering that? Rey: Sometimes it's your choice and sometimes it isn't. If there's a topic that's of your interest, you should discuss that with your managers, your leaders, and tell them, I would like to work in this team in the future. It doesn't need to be this week, it doesn't need to be this quarter, but I would like to aim my career in that direction. Sometimes companies go through big reorgs and it's not your choice to end up in one team or another, but it is up to you to make the most out of it. It comes back to the big team player framework. How can I make the most out of this situation? It's challenging because you don't have the domain expertise, you don't have the knowledge, but you need to acknowledge that it's going to be a rough patch in your career where you need more time to learn, but that it can also be an opportunity if you can make this team succeed by now having you, and how you can do that. Participant 4: When you're just a junior engineer and you've been in your company for a good bit and you start to recognize some inefficiencies across the organization and the processes, do you think at that level you can already start to plan these initiatives and try to influence direction, or is that something you really have to wait for once you can achieve that level and have that influence? I'm curious on your perspective on that. Rey: I think it really depends on the context. It's not the same thing to do that at a company with 10,000 employees against doing that at a startup with 20 employees. If you're a junior at a startup, you're very well empowered to make those initiatives. Large companies tend to favor diversity of voices lately and tend to try to listen to anyone. There's the opportunity to do that, but it's much harder to come up with a real idea that will actually change the company if it's so big. I think you can always do it, but it's going to be much easier if the company is smaller.

Title: The Elder Scrolls VI and a new Fallout: Xbox insider alleges exciting developments regarding two of Xbox's biggest franchises

Microsoft recently shook up its gaming division with tons of layoffs and multiple project cancellations. Among the canceled projects, there was ZeniMax Online’s unannounced “Project Blackbird” MMO RPG. It now appears that the cancellation of ZeniMax’s game might’ve given life to another Bethesda project, one that many fans have been asking for. In the latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast, Jez Corden claims that Microsoft decided to cancel ZeniMax’s MMO to allocate the capital to the development of Fallout 5. As such, the development of Fallout 5 has seemingly been greenlit. This is certainly good news for Fallout fans who have been disappointed by Fallout 76 and are waiting for a direct, single-player sequel to Fallout 4. Unfortunately, Jez reveals nothing about the potential Fallout 5 release date nor does he suggest anything about which studio is handling the development. Seeing as how Bethesda is busy supporting Fallout 76, Starfield, and is developing The Elder Scroll VI, it is difficult to imagine that the company has the bandwidth to start development of Fallout 5. Fortunately, Microsoft has another prolific RPG-maker in Obsidian. Assuming Obsidian is the studio behind Fallout 5, this wouldn’t be surprising as the studio has already worked on a Fallout game in the past, Fallout: New Vegas, which was quite well received. In addition to confirming Fallout 5, Jez also shares an interesting update regarding The Elder Scrolls VI. Back in June, before the Xbox Showcase 2025 aired, we reported that Microsoft could premier The Elder Scrolls VI at the event. The news came to us from Jez Corden who now alleges hearing that The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in a playable state. This was reportedly the basis for Jez’s earlier speculation that the game could show up at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. We must mention here that, aside from a short teaser trailer from 2018, Bethesda hasn’t revealed anything important about The Elder Scrolls VI. So, we have no idea how far along in development the game is or when it might release. If we have to speculate, we could see The Elder Scrolls VI release date falling sometime in 2027 to coincide with the launch of the next-gen Xbox. Having a game as big as The Elder Scrolls VI be a launch title for a new Xbox console would be a pretty big deal, as Sony is sure to prepare some heavy hitter for the PS6’s alleged 2027 release date. Before we take our leave, we must mention that we have no way of confirming these rumors. So, take the information with a giant grain of salt.

Title: Texas officials defend flood response and Tucker Carlson criticizes Trump: Morning Rundown

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Republican strategists want lawmakers to get specific when selling the “big, beautiful bill” to voters. State and local officials defend their response to the catastrophic floods in Central Texas. And Tucker Carlson explains why he’s pushing back against some of Trump’s recent decisions. Here’s what to know today. Now that Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is signed into law, it’s likely the president will continue to use the alliterative turn of phrase he coined in talking about the legislation. But those in his own party, as well as Democrats, know those superlatives say nothing about what the measure means for Americans worried about the price of gas and groceries — so they’re setting out to explain what the bill means for daily life. Two Republican strategists said they’re advising lawmakers to use different titles — such as the “Working Family Tax Cuts” act or possibly the “Trump Working Family Tax Cuts” — when referring to the legislation. The aim is to allude to policies, like no taxes on tips or overtime, that were popular among Trump voters. They’re also advising lawmakers to tout the additional money going to states for border enforcement. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The White House also believes that other parts of the bill that may not have gotten as much attention are widely popular. For example, Republican polling shows a planned overhaul of the nation’s air traffic control system is the best-liked component of the act. Trump, however, isn’t planning to traverse the nation to pitch the bill to voters. Instead, it’ll fall largely on his administration. An early test comes tomorrow, when Vice President JD Vance gives a speech at a machine shop in Pennsylvania, where he is expected to highlight how the bill “helps working class people most of all,” a person familiar with the speech said. Democrats, meanwhile, are poised to contest the Republican talking points at every turn. At stake is control of Congress, which is up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections. Read the full story here. Local and state officials who responded to the catastrophic flooding this month in Central Texas said they did everything in their power to save lives. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice, Kerr County Commissioner Jeff Holt and state Rep. Wes Virdell told NBC News over the weekend that officials did their best to coordinate evacuations and rescues against uncontrollable forces of nature. "Our teams did everything they possibly could with this gruesome, devastating situation that happened, and we would not change the way we did that. And I think we saved as many people as we could," Rice said. However, the officials noted that a permanent emergency operations center, more diversion dams and better cellphone service in certain areas might save lives in future floods. At least 132 people have died after the Guadalupe River surged to unprecedented heights in the early morning of July 4. More than 160 people are still missing. Kerr County and Kerrville officials held separate meetings yesterday about the ongoing flood response, though they mostly steered clear of addressing speculation over how leaders communicated about the floods. Read the full story here. A study of more than 1.2 million people found that there is no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. The study, published yesterday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, used Denmark’s nationwide registry to study people born between 1997 and 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared to those who received less. The study looked for connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions and five neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD. Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who said on a 2024 podcast that aluminum in vaccines is “extremely neurotoxic.” Read the full story here. NBC News' politics team has been closely tracking MAGA influencers raising the alarm about some the moves by President Donald Trump and his administration — whether that means bombing Iranian nuclear facilities, floating a deportation carve-out for undocumented farm workers or shutting down the release of additional information on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. No one’s pushback garnered more curiosity, though, than Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host-turned-"America First" thought leader who was gifted a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention last summer. Carlson had been aligned closely with the president after both men found themselves in exile after Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 election. I was able to get Carlson on the phone and ask about what’s been driving his recent criticism. “I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson told me last week, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.” Carlson spoke with me at a key moment for MAGA that is testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump, the man who brought the movement together, can shift its direction. If any of these influencers can play a role in shaping Trump's right-wing alliance, it's Carlson. — Allan Smith, politics reporter Want to perfectly block out other sounds or run with perfectly balanced audio?

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Jensen Huang is not an AI doomer, but he said developing tech could cause job losses if humans can’t come up with new ideas. As CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker now worth $4 trillion, Huang has a unique insight on the acceleration of AI adoption, and most of what he sees is positive. While some AI critics have warned the technology will lead to mass layoffs, Huang said it’s not likely. “If the world runs out of ideas, then productivity gains translates to job loss,” Huang told CNN. Just take a look at history: over the hundreds of years past as technology advanced, productivity gains went hand-in-hand with employment gains, said Huang. “Over the course of the last 300 years, 100 years, 60 years, even, in the era of computers, not only did productivity go up, employment also went up,” he said. “Now the reason for that is if we have an abundance of ideas, ways that we could build a better future, if we were more productive, we could realize that better.” The development of AI could also help humans by helping to surface new ideas across industries. The possibility of adding AI-enabled robots to fill the 30- to 40-million worker gap in skilled labor could also be positive and could help industry and the economy grow. Yet, without new ventures and ideas, the future looks more bleak, he said. “If you have no more ideas and all you want to do is this, then productivity drives down. It results in job loss.” Huang’s comments stand in stark contrast to those of Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who said AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white collar jobs and spike unemployment by double digits over the next five years. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also warned AI will reduce the company’s total corporate workforce. Huang stands out as one of the more optimistic leaders in the AI space, although he noted that AI will certainly transform all jobs, and has already changed his own responsibilities. Although, he cheekily noted, he is still doing the job. Rather than fully replace humans, AI is already supercharging their productivity by equalizing the playing field, and hopefully, the productivity gains lift society, he added. “AI empowers people, it lifts people, it closes the gap, the technology gap, and as a result more and more people are going to be able to do more things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Most Companies Pick Layoffs. Here’s Why They’re Wrong.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertamatuson/2025/07/14/why-layoffs-are-hurting-companies/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T12:30:00Z

ByRoberta Matuson ByRoberta Matuson, Contributor. The long-term impact of company-wide layoffs Major companies are picking layoffs in the name of efficiency—but is it really making them better? Another day, another layoff announcement. Layoffs are surging across industries, with firms like JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and Amazon making headlines for workforce reductions. Just last month, Microsoft announced plans to cut thousands more employees. Corporate America believes a leaner workforce equals quicker growth, but what are the real consequences? When the economy is in flux, companies tend to take the standard approach of slashing headcount, automating roles, and consolidating team. They do this to achieve immediate cost savings, streamlined operations, and to satisfy their investors. This approach may look good on paper, but is this method effective in the long run? No doubt, a massive layoff can result in dollars being added to the bottom line, but at what cost? Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise: Remember how long it took you to bring new hires up to speed and to train them on your systems? The money and time spent will be gone the moment the laid off employee walks out the door, as will the knowledge. This can severely disrupt operations and hinder innovation. Increased Employee Burnout and Decreased Engagement: Workers are already showing signs of employee burnout. Can you afford to ask your people to do more with less resources? Lower morale leads to reduced engagement, which may very well result in higher voluntary turnover—especially among top performers. Decline in Customer Satisfaction and Damage to Your Brand: Reducing headcount can result in slower service, lower quality, more errors, diminished customer trust, ultimately harming the company’s reputation and bottom line. Is your company brand strong enough to survive dips in quality and unflattering social media posts? Legal and Financial Risks: Layoffs can expose companies to legal challenges, such as wrongful termination claims, and may result in significant severance packages being paid out, along with unexpected legal costs. Do you have enough money in your coffers to budget for this? There are better ways than a layoff to boost efficiency. Here are some effective strategies worth further consideration. Focus on Skills, Not Just Headcount: Examine the skills your staff currently has and redeploy talent rather than cut jobs. Let Non-Performers Go: Terminate them, rather than covering this move up by using a layoff to rid your organization of dead weight. Invest in People: Help them reskill and upskill so they can be more productive for your organization. Offer Flexible Work Arrangements: Some workers may jump at the chance to work a reduced workweek or to job share. Offer Voluntary Buyouts and Early Retirement. Provide incentives for employees to leave voluntarily. Reducing headcount this way will be more favorably perceived by remaining staff than a layoff. Develop New Income Streams: It’s said that necessity is the mother of invention. Look for new opportunities to expand your revenues. Although it may be tempting to follow the latest trend of company-wide layoffs, think twice before taking your next step. By proactively implementing these strategies, organizations can navigate through economic upheaval with minimal disruption to their workforce and emerge stronger for the future.

Title: You Have No Idea How Furious the Canadians Are

Time Published: 2025-07-14T09:00:21Z

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In May, I reoriented my algorithms to flood me with Canadian content, turned on push notifications from The Globe and Mail, and temporarily moved my family north of the border. For months, Donald Trump had been casually threatening to annex Canada and turn it into a state, adding insult to the injury of the trade war he was waging on the country. One prime minister resigned amid Trump’s bullying, and another was elected because voters thought he could stand up to him. In the ordinarily placid provinces, feelings of bewilderment, anxiety, and offense hardened into a defiant resolve against the United States. “Elbows up,” went the nation’s new hockey-inspired mantra. As a Montreal journalist told me, Americans were preoccupied with “12 different crises.” In Canada, this was the crisis. Anti-American resistance was visible as soon as I landed. At a news kiosk at Toronto Pearson International Airport, the cover of Maclean’s, the de facto national magazine, teased “20 Reasons to Eat Canadian.” Inside was a letter from the editor about canceling a vacation to Cape Cod. This was mild compared with the cover of its next issue, “The New Nationalism,” which contained articles about “Why Canada Will Never Be an American State,” “How to Fight Back Against Trump’s Tariffs,” and “Fear and Loathing in a Canadian Border Town.” The publication had a new promotional campaign: “Canada’s Not for Sale. (But Maclean’s is.)” In grocery stores, Canada-affiliated products had been demarcated with red maple-leaf insignia — an official act of solidarity that complemented the consumer practice of flipping U.S. products upside down to make them easier to avoid. At a Loblaws, a woman wearing a leather jacket and AirPods was inspecting a jar of pomegranate marmalade to verify its country of origin. “I’m so disgusted by what’s going on down there. The most recent Harvard thing?” she said. “I shop on Amazon all the time — I recognize it’s an American company — I switched from buying stuff made in America to buying stuff made in China. And you know what? I’m okay with it.” She suggested I download an app called Maple Scan, which would tell me how Canadian a product was when I took a picture of it. (Canada Dry ginger ale, I learned, is owned by the American conglomerate Keurig Dr Pepper.) The app is just one of a crush of new tools that people up North are using to scrutinize the Canadianness of their purchases. Another one called TheCanadaList.ca was founded by a forensic-psychology professor at Ontario Tech University. He broke down his new habits in a newspaper interview: “I’ve switched from Oreos to Dare or Leclerc, from Nature Valley to MadeGood, from Lay’s to Hardbite, from Oikos to Liberté, from Tostitos to Mad Mexican.” The Buy Canadian phenomenon was even more pronounced on the alcohol front, as the country’s liquor stores are mostly government-run. Ontario Premier Doug Ford — brother of the late Rob Ford, the scandal-plagued Toronto mayor — halted the sale of American products by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, inspiring the other provinces to do the same. I drove to a Toronto LCBO to experience a liquor store with zero bottles of Tito’s Handmade vodka or Josh Cellars Merlot. Taped to the entrance were signs in French and English announcing the removal of U.S. products FOR THE GOOD OF CANADA. I was handed, and asked not to misplace, a laminated list of Canadian alternatives to popular American products. A clerk told me the U.S. booze was in the cellar aging indefinitely. Caught in the crossfire are blameless Canadian products that have an American stigma. For example: White Claw hard seltzer. “White Claw is a Canadian company that made itself huge down South,” Tyler VanderWallen, the general manager of Toronto’s Grizzly Bar, told me (“down South” is the U.S.). “If I sold White Claw here, I’d have to explain that to every third person, and I don’t want to have that fight.” Grizzly Bar is located on Toronto’s nightlife-heavy Queen Street West. A 14-foot inflatable moose guards its front door, and patrons are greeted by a motion-sensor-activated snippet of “O Canada” when they walk through it. The cocktails have names only Canadians understand, like “TVO Kids” and “Hadfield.” Everywhere, there is knowing Canadian kitsch: Canadian-side Niagara Falls projected onto a wall; a Wall of Heroes featuring framed photos of Ryan Reynolds, Leonard Cohen, Shania Twain, Margaret Atwood, Alex Trebek, and 46 others; a map of the key battles of the War of 1812. The bar is owned by a Vancouver video-game designer and his wife, who like to change its theme regularly, “like a piece of code.” When Trump ramped up his attacks, switching to a rabidly pro-Canada décor was the obvious move. The establishment was now under extra pressure to present a wholly Canadian front, from food ingredients to playlists. VanderWallen has started sourcing limes from Mexico instead of the U.S., even though they cost him around 20 cents more apiece. He said he still buys Heinz ketchup “because there’s a Heinz branch in Canada that is promising me I am getting 95 percent Canadian tomatoes.” Other establishments became anti-American against their will. When I visited Badlands, a Toronto bourbon bar that opened three months before all the bourbon disappeared, the manager, Carolina Rodriguez, pointed to a shelf of whiskey bottles she hadn’t intended to stock: Crown Royal (Canadian), Johnnie Walker (Scottish), and Bushmills (Irish). Deprived of the authentic U.S. product, Badlands rebranded as an all-purpose “country” bar. “My favorite cocktail is a Paper Plane, and if you have to make it without bourbon, it is terrible,” Rodriguez confessed to me. When she feels a customer deserves it, she’ll pull from her dwindling stash of pre-Prohibition Jim Beam and make them a proper drink without revealing its key ingredient. The country’s political class has attempted to sever itself from the U.S. by reorienting the Canadian economy in an east-west rather than north-south direction. For example, Canada is knocking down interprovincial trade barriers that make it near impossible to order a bottle of gin from Winnipeg if you live across the country, in say, Halifax. But on an individual level, the most evident rupture has occurred with respect to travel. Southbound commerce and tourism, even to once-symbiotic border destinations, has fallen off a cliff. Horror stories circulating about aggressive U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents don’t help. Buffalo’s new “Buffalo Loves Canada” campaign is trying to entice Canadian visitors by raffling off a $500 gift certificate and by emphasizing its appreciation of Canadian brands. (“Looking at you, Tim Hortons, Swiss Chalet, and Labatt Blue!”) The director of New York’s Thousand Islands tourism bureau stopped showing American images to Canadians on social media “because that allowed for some of that negative sentiment to fester.” The unfavorable exchange rate had already dampened Canadian enthusiasm for the U.S. before Trump smothered it entirely, said Caroline Beteta, the half-Canadian president and CEO of Visit California, the state’s tourism agency. But now warm-weather American states were desperately trying to lure staycationing “snowbirds” back to the sunny regions that rely on their seasonal commerce. “The Canadian media didn’t really want to entertain interviews with us,” Beteta said. She and her team put together an ad spot to highlight connections between the two peoples: the California roll, invented by a chef from British Columbia; Napa’s Signorello Estate, owned by a Canadian. YouTube commenters found it unpersuasive. The snowbird deficit was especially pronounced in Florida, with travelers flocking to the Caribbean instead and Canadian airlines axing direct flights. Governor Ron DeSantis didn’t seem too worried about the 3.3 million Canadians who visited in 2024 not returning, though others in Florida were frantic. “We don’t have any emails; we don’t have any calls,” said Karine Martinez, the Miami-based executive director of the CanadaFlorida Chamber of Commerce. These kinds of casualties are all over the place: In May, Canada’s passport office announced it was cutting 800 jobs because of decreased demand for applications. I spoke to snowbirds who are not just boycotting the beach but have sold second homes. One tech investor who built a house north of Palm Beach a few years ago told me his American golf buddies started making 51st-state jokes: “The first time, it’s funny. The second time, okay. The third time, it’s becoming annoying.” The last straw was a guy in a pickup truck who saw his plates in a parking lot and told him to go back to Canada. This is no way to live, he recalled thinking. Dale Hajas, a retiree from Ontario, recently kissed good-bye to her Greater Tampa development, where she estimates one-fifth of the winter residents are Canadian. “I’ve written to every tourism outlet in the United States — and not very graciously, I swear — to tell them why I will never set foot” there again, she said. “I redacted and then sent out-of-date bank statements showing what we’ve spent in the U.S. over the years.” Edmundston, New Brunswick, sits directly across the border from Madawaska, Maine. Both communities are bilingual, and until this year, their historically Acadian roots bound them more to each other than to their respective nations. Now, Edmundston’s mayor, Eric Marquis, told me border tensions have ruined everything. Residents say they will never return to the U.S., even though everybody has family on both sides and Edmundstoners used to cross over all the time for cheaper gas. “We had to procure two new fire trucks this year,” Marquis said, and this time, they had to be Canadian made. “The first question posed by the city council was ‘Where do they come from?’” The rupture began in earnest last fall. After decades of ho-hum amity that had survived the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in his first term, Trump began to covetously talk about the “faucet” of Canadian river water he wished to divert to California. After the election, then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau traveled to Mar-a-Lago to try to calm Trump’s early trade-related belligerence. The visit backfired when Trump mused about annexation over dinner, then started referring to Trudeau as a mere “governor” on Truth Social. Deeply unpopular even before Trump started messing with him, Trudeau announced his resignation in January. Trump proceeded to air grievances about Canada’s stingy military spending and dairy-production quotas while calling into question the boundaries governing control of the Great Lakes and the 1908 treaty that established the 49th parallel as the border. The administration then applied a round of tariffs to Canada, allegedly to punish it for the fentanyl slipping in from the north. (From 2022 to 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 59 pounds of fentanyl from Canada, compared with 61,900 pounds from Mexico.) Trump’s top brass took up the cause too. FBI director Kash Patel declared on Fox News that 85 percent of “known or suspected” terrorists who entered the country last year came via Canada. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a library that straddles the border, hopping from Quebec to Vermont while chanting “51st state!” Through the early months of the year, the administration continued to threaten, delay, and apply more tariffs while others were struck down in court. Canada is now chiefly being hit with 50 percent duties on steel and aluminum and 25 percent on automobiles, categories from which it had theoretically won exemptions when it signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, a pact Trump called “the best trade deal ever made.” In April, Canada experienced a record trade deficit, driven by a double-digit decline in automobile exports. That month, the central banker and political novice Mark Carney led the underdog Liberals to an upset national victory, which the party owed to the electorate’s view that the once-favored Conservative Party could not credibly stand up to Trump. “Trump is trying to break us so he can own us,” Carney had argued on the campaign trail. Even if most Canadians didn’t deem it likely that Trump would literally invade, there was agreement that he was, for some reason, fixated on crippling them. Carney has since applied counter-tariffs on some $30 billion of U.S. goods, targeting red-state-manufactured products such as bowling balls and bullets. There is only so much pain a country nine times less populous than the United States can inflict, but Canada’s boycotts have started to have their intended effect. Not long after the alcohol ban was imposed, a Kentucky distiller reported he’d already lost $115,000 from canceled shipments to Canada. Every week brings new statistics documenting Canadian retrenchment. Car trips to the U.S.: down 38 percent. Flights: down 24 percent. Canadian web traffic to the home-listings site Redfin: down 26 percent. Thirty-four U.S. states count Canada as their largest export market. “Give us another chance,” said North Dakota Republican Kevin Cramer, when a delegation of U.S. senators visited Ottawa to try and mend relations. In early May, Carney and Trump held a predictably surreal press conference in the Oval Office. Trump began genially, congratulating Carney on his election: “It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine.” But when a reporter asked if he still envisioned Canada as the 51st state, Trump killed the goodwill. “You know, I’m a real-estate developer at heart,” he said. The president waxed poetic about erasing “that artificially drawn line” on the map between the U.S. and Canada, saying that “when you look at that beautiful formation, when it’s together — I’m a very artistic person — but when I looked at that beauty, I said, ‘That’s the way it was meant to be.’” Carney interjected coolly, “Well, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We’re sitting in one right now.” Trump’s attacks galvanized Canadians because they had thought of their relationship with the U.S. as fraternal; the two countries share a language, cultural idioms, an undefended 5,525-mile border. When the Canadian journalist Paul Wells reluctantly severed his ties with the States this year, he wrote that it felt like an “amputation.” Yet the result of Canada’s withdrawal has been not just a mass “freedom fries” moment but a quest to redefine a national ethos distinct from American influence. Ten years ago, Trudeau told the New York Times his country had “no core identity” and had proudly set aside its cultural divisions to become “the first post-national state.” Now, Trump has given Trudeau’s own listless party an opening to reclaim a sense of patriotism, making Conservative pols feel like the victims of a stolen-valor campaign but uniting most everyone else around an invigorating shared project. When Scarborough, Ontario, native Mike Myers brandished a CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE T-shirt and mouthed “Elbows up” on Saturday Night Live — the phrase is associated with Red Wings legend Gordie Howe — he gave a name to the movement sweeping the country. In an ad spot for his bid for prime minister, Carney grilled Myers, a U.S. resident, to make sure he had retained his Canadian in-knowledge. (Carney: “What are the two seasons in Toronto?” Myers: “Winter and construction.”) Celebrity affiliation cuts the other way, too. In June, Jagmeet Singh, the former leader of the progressive New Democratic Party, was spotted attending a Kendrick Lamar concert, which was arguably disloyal to Lamar’s rival, Drake, even in peacetime. The Toronto rapper called him out, and Singh groveled for forgiveness, claiming he had been there only to see the other headliner, SZA. Also, wine from the estate that produces Wayne Gretzky’s line has become an exception to the Buy Canadian rule. Once a national hero, Gretzky is now persona non grata for his friendship with Trump. A guy offering tastings at a kiosk told me he places Gretzky’s wine as far from the customer eyeline as possible. One of the surest signs of the national mood shift is that even in Quebec, the independence-minded, Anglo-skeptical electorate is reporting unprecedented surges of Canadian patriotism. The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Yves-François Blanchet, has dismissed the rest of Canada as “an artificial country.” Yet many Québécois have swung toward the Liberals as a bulwark against Trump, and Blanchet understands the need to ally with them too. “This truce will last as long as we face the challenge imposed by Trump,” he told Maclean’s. Even the most anti-Canada Canadians I met couldn’t work themselves up for annexation. In Ottawa, I met Nicholas Ewanchuk outside the Canadian Parliament; he was flying a Trump flag, an American flag superimposed with an 18-wheeler, and an upside-down Canadian flag — the latter two symbols of the trucker convoy that blockaded Ottawa in 2022 in protest of COVID-19 restrictions. A Saskatchewan trucker fired for noncompliance, Ewanchuk had been protesting in Ottawa ever since. I asked if he was interested in joining the U.S. He winced, parrying the question. “You know, there never used to be a border. Back in the day, it was called Turtle Island,” he said, using an Indigenous term for the North American landmass. Canadian Star Trek legend William Shatner has been publicly workshopping a counterproposal to the U.S., summoning his Captain Kirk persona to engage in freelance diplomacy. “Canadians are very aware of the ka-ra-te adage ‘Use the opponent’s weight against them,’” Shatner told me from Los Angeles. “Canada should say to President Trump, ‘You are the head of a rambunctious country, very difficult to govern at this point. We can ease your pain. Canada is calm, settled, successful. Clean air, clean water, pleasant people. Why don’t you become the 11th province?’” Two days after I arrived in Canada, I caught a plane to Ottawa to get a glimpse of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Charles had come to the capital to deliver a highly anticipated address to the Canadian Parliament called a “Speech From the Throne,” the climax of a pomp-filled 24-hour visit plotted by the new prime minister as a symbolic rebuke to Trump. In the hours leading up to the speech, I followed the royals to events designed to showcase Canada’s heritage and natural bounty: a puck drop at a youth hockey game, a farmers’ market, a tree planting, a military parade, all of them thronged with people in maple-leaf and Union Jack gear. Rolling out the red carpet for one’s old colonial master may not seem like an obvious demonstration of national sovereignty, but it made sense in Canada: Since Trump has a thing for the royals, it was a flex that the nation, as a member of the Commonwealth, could summon its king on short notice, especially as Charles was undergoing treatments for cancer. Amid Trump’s confusing aggression, the visit would also underscore the country’s secure place in a wider global dominion. And contrary to the idea that the two nations were intuitively mergeable, a choreographed regal affair might accentuate certain proudly un-American aspects of Canada’s national character, such as the “peace, order, and good government” enshrined in its constitution. In the capital, the royal visit was treated as a national holiday. Even its most benign details were curated, or at least interpreted, to reflect the hostile new dynamic between Canada and its longtime ally to the south. On previous visits, for example, Charles had been chauffeured in an American-made Lincoln. This time, he rode in a BMW. A royal historian named Justin Vovk insisted to the CBC that even Charles’s planting of a single tree would “take on added symbolism,” given Trump’s rhetoric about Canada’s natural resources. Waiting for the royals to show up at the farmers’ market, I chatted up well-wishers pressed against a security perimeter. A woman named Lucia Velasco told me she saw Charles as a stabilizing force in wartime. “And right now we are not at war, but …,” she said, trailing off. Debbie Guiry, standing nearby and wearing a Union Jack umbrella hat, finished the thought: “It feels like it.” The night before the “Speech From the Throne,” I met Liam Mooney at the Rideau Club, an elite gathering spot established by two of Canada’s founding fathers. Mooney, who runs an Ottawa branding agency with his wife, created the now-famous CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE cap worn by Premier Ford, which has sold more than 50,000 units and inspired many knockoffs. A little sheepishly, Mooney told me, he has cried at just two celebrity deaths — those of NFL broadcaster John Madden and Queen Elizabeth II. In other words, some part of him could easily have been American, but another was not. In January, after Trudeau announced his resignation, Mooney said, “We had this weird problem where Canada doesn’t have a dad.” Today, he said, half-joking, “Granddad is here.” Over my weeks in Canada, I encountered a number of attempts to retrofit a cohesive identity onto a nation that can seem best defined by its agreeable pastiche of other nations’ influences. “Talking about the Canadian border or the 49th parallel like it’s an imaginary thing — it forces you to think, like, Okay, well, what is it that we’re about?” Mooney said. “Well, Canada’s bilingual. We are a peacekeeping nation. We are a winter nation. When it’s 30 below Celsius, you better have a good relationship with your neighbor” because it’s too cold to head into town for milk. Mooney repeated an adage I heard a lot: The country is a mosaic of peoples, rather than an assimilated, American-style melting pot. “We are a parliamentary democracy,” he said. “We were founded by these two crowns, the British and the French.” A Euro-style social democracy built on a foundation of Tory mildness, Canada can feel lab-designed for compromise and geniality. In The Globe and Mail, a writer described the nation as one of “satirists and folk singers, sage retired bureaucrats, and many, many farmers.” In Maclean’s, another writer compared Canada’s “long but imperfect history of muddling along peaceably” with America’s “unpredictable and increasingly dysfunctional empire.” All of which makes the new Canadian nationalism so striking. Despite Trump’s instigation of the conflict, there is an oddly abstract quality to U.S. bellicosity; even the president’s most loyal supporters may be only vaguely aware that the relationship with the country’s close trading partner and military ally has completely ruptured. Whereas in Canada, where nobody had a problem in the first place, virtually the entire population is now charged up and doing bespoke economic protectionism. “In the U.S., there’s roughly 350 million people going on their way, la-di-da,” said Ford, the Ontario premier. “But there’s 41 million Canadians at a fever pitch right now doing everything they possibly can to support the cause. I’ve never seen patriotism like this.” The “Speech From the Throne” took place at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday. Normally a rote address used to open a new session of Parliament, the actual sovereign had only twice appeared in person to deliver it. And while the speech was written by the prime minister’s staff, even the subtlest anti-Trump jab ventriloquized by the monarch would be newsworthy. The country’s political class showed up in full, including vanquished Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. First Nations leaders from the prairie provinces arrived in traditional headdresses, and Trudeau caused a fuss by wearing turquoise-and-orange Adidas Gazelles with his suit. The king began by acknowledging the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people, then delivered his speech in French and English, alternating every few paragraphs. “When my dear late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, opened a new Canadian Parliament in 1957, the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,” read Charles in his familiar murmur. Sitting beside him was Camilla, wearing a maple-leaf brooch. Now, he continued, “Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes.” The king spoke of self-determination and the rule of law and trade, rendering the target of his speech unmistakable. His closing line generated a rousing ovation: “As the anthem reminds us, the True North is indeed strong and free.” If the goal was to get Trump’s attention, it appeared to work. Later that day, he posted on Truth Social, “I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!” In my travels, I met a retired high-school history teacher named Peter Kear who loaned me his copy of a 1993 book called The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Canadian Resistance to American Expansionism. As an American typically unversed in Canadian history, I wondered if its title was maybe a bit hyperbolic. Then I opened the book to example after footnoted example of zealous American attempts to dominate Canada. “Come then, ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty,” General George Washington wrote to the Canadians in September 1775, announcing he had authorized a military invasion “not to plunder, but to protect you.” The British Empire had recently conquered Quebec and the rest of New France from Louis XV, and the Americans were trying to enlist the colony in their brewing revolution. Their entreaties failed, in part because of Britain’s shrewd passage of the 1774 Quebec Act, which allowed the province to maintain its Catholic religion. Washington launched a New Year’s Eve invasion of Quebec City that ended in miserable defeat and the capture of 372 of Colonel Benedict Arnold’s 500 troops. America was undeterred. “The unanimous voice of the Continent is that Canada must be ours,” insisted John Adams, then a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. In the winter of 1776, Benjamin Franklin was sent north on a diplomatic mission to tout the U.S. cause, which also failed. After the Americans won the Revolutionary War, tens of thousands of Tory “United Empire Loyalists” fled to Canada, massively increasing its English-speaking population and arguably seeding the temperamental divide between tranquil Canada and its more ardent neighbor to the south. In 1812, President James Madison declared war and invaded Canada again; Speaker of the House Henry Clay said, “I would take the whole continent from them.” (The war is generally considered a draw, but I was made to understand that British Canada and its Shawnee allies should be seen as the victors because the invading Americans gained no territory while their opponents burned down the White House.) In 1844, James K. Polk won the presidency on the strength of the “54-40 or Fight” campaign to claim northwestern land clear to Alaska, up through present-day British Columbia. From the Canadian perspective, the movement to confederate the country’s provinces into a single nation was driven partly by the need to resist American expansion, which Canadians feared would spread northward after the military buildup of the Civil War. “They coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted Louisiana, and they purchased it; they coveted Texas, and stole it,” said Thomas D’Arcy McGee, a Father of Confederation who had moved from the U.S. to escape its “diseased love of excitement.” McGee was allegedly murdered by a member of an Irish separatist group that attacked Canada with the possible blessing of President Andrew Johnson. Even after Britain granted Canada the right to self-governance, in 1867, the U.S. continued to wage economic warfare in an attempt to bring the young country to its knees. In 1888, Secretary of State James Blaine wrote that, like a ripe apple, Canada would “fall into our hands” and “seek admission to the Union” if the U.S. bludgeoned it with the heavy import duties that became known as the McKinley -Tariff, named for Trump’s favorite protectionist. (There have also been Canadian pro-annexationists, including the composer of “O Canada,” of all people, who in the 1880s became embittered with his country and moved to Massachusetts.) Relations improved vastly in the 20th century, but even in the 1980s, vestigial anxiety about American imperialism was such that many felt free trade, not protectionism, was the thing that would finally KO Canada’s sovereignty. The 1988 Liberal Party leader John Turner argued the trade pact that preceded NAFTA would reduce the country “to a colony of the United States” dependent on the impulses of its corporations. Turner lost that year’s election, but a million more Canadians voted for the anti-free-trade candidates than against them. (The author of my talismanic new history book, David Orchard, was one of the leaders of the movement.) So a student of Canadian history might not have been surprised at a renewed bout of U.S. encroachment, nor the Canadian response to it. “The U.S. always seems to think, If we can threaten you economically, you’ll just come and join us,” says Christopher Sands, an expert on U.S.-Canada relations. Sands used to direct the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute, until, tellingly, the Wilson Center was dismantled by DOGE. “It has never worked. It only ever builds up a certain Canadian nationalistic response,” he said. Of course, not every single last Canadian is living life at a nonstop anti-U.S. fever pitch. Though nobody wants to be annexed, there tends to be an older-white-liberal bent to the most fervent of the new patriots, as at a “No Kings” rally. The cause may feel less urgent for oil-and-gas libertarians in Alberta, which is home to a growing separatist movement, or in the immigrant enclaves of the Toronto suburbs that voted Conservative in the recent election, where people were focused on housing costs and quality-of-life issues. Some demographics are bound to find the rah-rah a little embarrassing. “Elbows up, or whatever,” wrote Slate’s Toronto-based music critic Carl Wilson on his Substack, recommending some Canadian LPs for Canada Day. Others are fully catastrophizing. This past spring, Canadian author Stephen Marche war-gamed a potential conflict in The Atlantic. Given the large discrepancy in the size of the countries’ standing armies, he figured the Canadian military response would have to include civilian insurgency. “If only one in 100 Canadians took up arms against an American occupation, that force would be 10 times the estimated size of the Taliban at the outset of the Afghan War. And that force would consist of machine-learning specialists and petroleum engineers rather than shepherds and subsistence farmers,” he wrote, citing a combat expert. “Canadians cannot afford complacency.” Marche has an eight-part podcast out on the U.S. threat featuring an image of geese and eagles fighting. The plot of Michael Moore’s 1995 movie Canadian Bacon is that a U.S. president gins up anti-Canadian hate to boost his approval rating, the running joke being, Who could possibly hate a Canadian? In South Park, Canadians are depicted as a malign, weird-looking species, and the townspeople hold them responsible for corrupting the youth. What pop culture treats as prima facie farcical, Trump is doing in real life: blaming Canada. His exact motivation remains opaque. Trade tensions flared in his first term, but there was no talk of water faucets and 51st states. Some theorize Trump enjoys trolling Trudeau and, even after his resignation, just never stopped. “He always saw Trudeau as a theater major,” said someone involved in the trade negotiations. Not all of Trump’s complaints are random. His grievances with Quebec’s protectionist dairy industry, which limits imports, were shared by the Biden administration. (Milk is the third rail of Canadian politics. Carney has already pledged not to touch it in trade negotiations, lest he lose Quebec’s support.) And especially now, you can find Canadians who agree with Trump that the country should ramp up its military-defense budget to meet NATO spending obligations, as Carney has pledged to do. When it comes to the president’s outré talking points, such as the location of the 49th parallel, observers of the conflict -suspect trade hawk and White House senior counselor Peter Navarro may be in his ear. In 2018, Navarro said there was a “special place in hell” for Trudeau during routine trade talks. This year, he reportedly proposed ejecting Canada from the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. (He denied the report.) When I texted Steve Bannon to ask what he thought of the new hostilities toward Canada, he replied, “LOVE IT.” But then, just a few months ago, Bannon struck a different tone in an interview with the Financial Times. “Canada punches way above their weight. If you look at military history, they’ve been the best ally we’ve had,” he said. Bannon didn’t pick up the phone when I tried to square the circle. “I’m not sure this has an intellectual underpinning, to be honest,” a former Trump-administration foreign-policy official told me. The tariffs themselves, should they stick, are likely to have mixed results. Canadians do fear they could decimate the auto industry. “We don’t really want cars from Canada,” Trump explained to Carney in May. “And at a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars.” That same month, General Motors announced it was eliminating a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant that makes Chevrolet Silverados, resulting in roughly 650 layoffs that will take place in the fall; GM is ramping up Silverado production in Indiana. But Canada’s inclusion in Trump’s aluminum tariffs has also generated puzzlement. The U.S. gets two-thirds of its aluminum from Canada, but those smelters are mostly powered by cheap Quebec hydroelectricity the U.S. probably can’t replicate. Sylvain Maltais, the head of the aluminum-workers union in the company town of Alma, told me that there had been no layoffs and that Rio Tinto, the mining giant that owns the plants, was proceeding with existing investments. “For the moment, it’s going well. There’s not a lot of stress,” Maltais said. In the U.S., however, the prices of seltzer and cat food — and anything else that comes in a can — are expected to rise. Even if a truce is reached to end the trade war, the national resistance against America will persist. As Trump continues to belittle and toy with Canada, its people have lost faith that its neighbor will treat it decently. At the start of the conflict, commenters tended to lump Trump’s attacks on Canada as of a piece with his designs on Greenland and the Panama Canal, all of it evidence of cartoonish saber-rattling. But as the rift deepened, Canadians began taking the imperialist threat seriously. Surveying the growing imbalance between the temperate Canadian climate and drought-stricken areas of the American West, an environmental journalist recently forecast, in the magazine The Walrus, a future in which Canada becomes a strip-mined “vassal state”: “As US aquifers go dry, the lakes will be a natural place to look.” On June 15, Trump arrived in Carney’s home province of Alberta for the Group of Seven Summit, where the Canadian media and political Establishment were cautiously optimistic that the conference might produce a new trade agreement. Would the countries patch things up? Instead, in a press conference, Trump blamed Barack Obama and Trudeau (who wasn’t in power at the time) for kicking Russia out of the then-G8 for its 2014 invasion of Crimea. Trump abruptly left the next day without any progress made on a deal, and Canadians felt had all over again. In July, seemingly out of the blue, Trump threatened a new round of tariffs on all Canadian goods, posting an open letter to Carney on social media in which he complained that Canada had “financially retaliated” against the U.S. and doubled down on the assertion that Canada fails “to stop the drugs from pouring” across the border. Carney responded on X: “We are committed to continuing to work with the United States.” But, he added, “we are building Canada strong” and “strengthening our trading partnerships throughout the world.” Until his retirement from Parliament earlier this year, Charlie Angus represented a large swath of rural Ontario. A rabble-rouser who plays in an alt-country band called the Grievous Angels, Angus has remade himself as a de facto leader of the “Elbows up” movement, posting testimonials of everyday resistance on Substack and touring auditoriums across the country. The night after Trump’s G7 exit, I went to one of his events in Oshawa, the economically anxious General Motors town. Filling the theater was a mostly older crowd with a few union types mixed in. Angus launched heatedly into his one-man show. “They thought, Canada, wow, let’s go pick on the Canadians, right? I mean, what’s easier to pick on than Canadians? That’s what they thought. They thought we were pushovers. Now they’re learning,” he said. It used to be “we didn’t need a big national story. We didn’t need to be jingoistic because we had next-door neighbors who were super-loud. We just did our thing. And then suddenly, we have a government who says we don’t even have a right to exist as a nation. Overnight, something changed for every person in this country. You said, ‘Not on my watch,’ and you sat down at the kitchen table and said, ‘No, we’re not going back to Florida.’ And you called the hotel in Arizona and said, ‘I don’t care if we lose our deposit.’” If all this sounded like a civilized way to conduct a trade war, well, that only underscored the rift. It takes a special kind of belligerence to piss off the nicest people on the planet. With friends like us, who needs enemies? And if our enemies now include Canada, we probably don’t have any friends left at all. A couple of weeks before the show, Angus and I had met in Toronto at Grizzly Bar. “You think I’m going to let that fucking criminal take my country? Not a chance,” he said as we drank Canadian beers. “So suddenly we go from being really easygoing to a nation of hockey goons.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Notebookcheck has been contacted by the person whose LinkedIn page mentioned the 2,000,000 number. They claim that it's not accurate first-party data but rather an estimate that they found online. Slightly edited article continues as follows: Earlier this year, Xbox announced that Forza Horizon 5 would become available on the PS5, nearly four years after it was released on Xbox and PC. The game eventually landed on the PlayStation 5 on April 29, 2025 as the first Forza game available on a platform other than Xbox and PC. Now, the LinkedIn page of an Xbox employee has revealed how well the game did on PlayStation. According to a post shared on X by Zuby_Tech, Forza Horizon 5 for the PlayStation 5 sold two million units in one month. The info comes from the LinkedIn page of former Xbox employee who had worked as a game designer at Turn 10 Studios, a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios but was recently laid off along with several others from Xbox. Listing his responsibilities at the studio, the game designer wrote that he created the cross-platform feature designs that allowed Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5 (available on Amazon for $499) to sell 2 million units in one month alone. That's an impressive figure for a video game that was released years ago on Xbox. While we don't know the total sales as of the time of writing, it most likely is well past two million units since it has been over two months since the game launched on the PS5. Xbox's recent layoffs have greatly affected Turn 10 Studios which is best known for its Forza Motorsport series. The studio lost half of its team, and has now been relegated to providing support for the Forza Horizon series. In addition, it has been reported that the Forza Motorsport series has been axed leaving the open world Forza Horizon series which is developed by Playground Games. Forza Horizon is expected to get a new installment next year. Zuby_Tech on X, Pushsquare

Xbox's recent layoffs have greatly affected Turn 10 Studios which is best known for its Forza Motorsport series. The studio lost half of its team, and has now been relegated to providing support for the Forza Horizon series. In addition, it has been reported that the Forza Motorsport series has been axed leaving the open world Forza Horizon series which is developed by Playground Games. Forza Horizon is expected to get a new installment next year. Zuby_Tech on X, Pushsquare

Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen. [Variety] In other computing headwear news, Meta has formalized their investment in EssilorLuxottica – $3.5B into the publicly-traded firm for a stake just under 3%, which they hope to bring up to 5%. Most importantly, this seemingly formalizes the fact that Google/Samsung/Apple/Snap/etc won't be working with their brands on any competing products... [Bloomberg 🔒] 'Max' is now officially 'HBO Max' again with app icons being updated around the world. No need to download a new app this time (which was another amazing moment of stupidity in all this). And now the countdown is officially on until they're 'HBO' again. [Verge] "I would expect Grok to discover new technologies that are actually useful no later than next year, and maybe end of this year. It might discover new physics next year… Let that sink in." – Elon Musk, talking a big game (obviously as usual) with the release of Grok 4. Can xAI back up these claims better than Meta was able to back up Mark Zuckerberg's big claims about Llama 4? Or will Elon be next to step in with $500M pay packages and 'Godfather' offers? (The early results seem promising for Grok 4 – but they also did for Llama 4! You can try it out yourself for the low-low price of $300/month.) In July 2015, 10 years ago, NVIDIA's market cap was $10B. Yesterday, it hit $4T. No posts Ready for more?

Title: What it takes to be a thriving Amazon seller making seven figures

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all? Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does. What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you. On the agenda today: But first: Side hustle tips from the pros. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online. Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success. How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers? A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club. What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits? The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to "a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there." He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum. What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle? After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming. I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, "It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you." For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration. BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like "fear," "uncertainty," "disheartening," and "bleak" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service. "I can't see any of this ending well." Also read: When the Sequoia Capital partner called NYC mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani an "Islamist," it made national news and prompted two open letters. Instead of an apology or deleted tweet, however, Maguire only doubled down on his comments. The saga might just mark a new era in a post-pandemic tech ecosystem. Top investors have learned they can be loud, bold, and polarizing, and it won't impact their ability to secure deals. The venture capital "fame game." Also read: Though the financial industry isn't the obvious target of Trump's immigration crackdown, its effects are still being felt across hiring, travel, and dealmaking. Lawyers, executives, and business leaders told BI how Trump's border policy is changing their daily lives, from amending the language they use at the border to scrutinizing immigration compliance in M&A deals. Wall Street as a border town. The search and cloud giant keeps salary data confidential. However, publicly available work visa data filed with the US Labor Department offers a glimpse of how much it pays certain roles. Google has hired thousands of software engineers through this process. The data shows they can command salaries as high as $340,000 before equity and bonuses. See how much key roles make. This week's quote: "She always made it clear she would walk away when the time was right. She made enough money that she doesn't need to work." — Linda Yaccarino's friend on Yaccarino leaving her CEO role at X. More of this week's top reads: Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino couldn't turn Elon Musk's business around — because of Elon Musk. The BI Today team: Steve Russolillo, chief news editor, in New York.
