CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking. The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy - ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples. The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS' turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval. Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They've also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they've struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they "will be designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs." RELATED: Why your drug store is closing "By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we're continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage," a CVS spokesperson told CNN. Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has "done very little to defend revenue" of the front-end of its stores. "It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it's not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there's growing competition from chains like Walmart," he told CNN. Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself as a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores. (The-CNN-Wire & 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.)

Title: 7 Rewarding Career Paths for the Fearless Agile Program Manager

STARCIO drive digital transformation STARCIO The redesigned StarCIO blog formally names Social, Agile, and Transformation. Learn more. Agile program managers are one of the roles hit hardest in the monthly stories of tech layoffs. I computed this by reviewing a sample of the 2022-2023 tech layoffs by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. From this sample, 8.3% of 500 layoffs impacted program managers. I suspect that the risk is much higher for program managers who champion waterfall, top-down, or command-and-control methodologies. Forrester reports 61% of organizations have deployed agile methodologies over the past five years and waterfall continues to decline. One of my most popular articles from 2021 was about how to be an agile program manager. Watch the embedded video on five key responsibilities of successful agile program managers and developing an agile program manager office. There may be a need for a program manager role in large enterprises with multi-team agile. Who manages vendors, contracts, and reporting for agile release trains (ARTs), tribes, or scrum of scrums, etc.? For other organizations, agile program manager roles are declining, especially during times of layoffs and downsizing. Agile program manager may feel a little vulnerable and scared about where to take their career paths. If you are laid off, you must consider repositioning yourself above and beyond your agile knowledge and program management skills. One of the key lessons in Chapter 1 of Digital Trailblazer is key to agile program managers. “Step out of your comfort zone and broaden your perspective by seeking outside‐in learning opportunities.” This is what I mean by the fearless, agile program managers. They step out of their comfort zones and develop competencies beyond the leadership skills and agile collaboration competencies. Consider your skills and experiences leading large-scale agile initiatives as building blocks. Here are seven career paths for agile program managers. This career path is for the more technical program managers. They develop DevOps, SDLC, cloud architecture, and other technical skill sets. It requires a hard pivot into more technical responsibilities, like becoming an agile technical team lead or solutions architect. The combination of agile program manager and architecture experience can lead to agile delivery leader roles and, potentially, CTO opportunities. Agile program managers who work in a single industry and develop expertise around its business models, customer segments, and operations should consider pivoting into business leadership responsibilities. The key to getting these roles is developing relationships with business executives in the industry who recognize program management as a key skill set and will open the doors when new opportunities emerge. Invest time at industry-specific conferences and networking events. This is a common career path for companies embracing agile methodologies and recognizing they need more product managers and agile product owners but fewer program and project managers. However, this transition only works well when CIOs commit to product management and the agile program manager embraces the key differences between program and product management responsibilities. If you seek this career path, consider reading selections from my 12 books for product managers and developing design thinking skills. Agile program managers who successfully lead product initiatives, grow end-user adoption, and drive revenue growth can pursue chief digital officer opportunities. Agile program managers with a knack, interest, and passion for compliance functions have two potential career paths. For those with data skill sets and an interest in machine learning and AI, developing a strong understanding of proactive data governance and GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, and other regulations can pivot into data governance leadership roles. Expand the skillset to AI governance and add a certification in ISO 27001 or similar, and there’s the opportunity to become an organization’s chief data officer. Pivoting from program management to information security roles may be a less likely career path, but it is still plausible for those willing to invest in the technical acumen and gain CISSP or similar certifications. One opportunity for agile program managers is to take on roles reporting to the CISO, including that of SOC Director, GRC Director, or security awareness leader. This career path may feel like taking a step backward in responsibilities, but it’s an option for agile program managers looking for stability and career opportunities in larger enterprises. ITSM leaders typically come up the ranks from individual contributor roles, but larger enterprises benefit by having ITSM directors who have strong customer support skills, agile backgrounds, and business relationship-building experiences. This career path is also good for agile program managers who are metrics-driven and enjoy driving continuous operational improvements. I know several program managers who achieved Six Sigma Black Belt certifications and developed expertise in change management who went on to become department directors. The key is to focus on a specific department’s operations and challenges and the opportunities beyond operational functions, especially in sales and marketing. The biggest mistake I see program managers make is getting too comfortable in their roles and expecting new opportunities based solely on the size and success of the initiatives they lead. Some program managers may go on to lead agile PMOs or become the CIO’s chief of staff. For many others, program management is a step in the journey, not a career. Find your path. I’m here to help.

Title: Forbes Daily: Markets Rattled, But Trump Remains Resolute On Tariffs

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. For all of the advancements in modern fitness technology, one of the latest viral crazes is remarkably simple: a headband with a ball attached by a stretchy string. Boxbollen has received endorsements from celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Conor McGregor, Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg, a strategy that hasn’t been cheap—Boxbollen has reinvested as much as 50% of its revenue into its marketing. But it’s paid off: In 2024, the company posted $59.2 million in revenue, its best year yet. “The question is sustainability,” a retail analyst told Forbes. “[A] $50 million business can grow into something larger, or it could fade away. … It’s hard to know what a $50 million business looks like a decade out.” President Donald Trump gestures as he departs the White House in Washington, DC, on March 7, 2025. President Donald Trump downplayed last week’s stock market drop in an interview Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” Last week featured a dizzying amount of tariff news, and Trump on Friday said he might impose reciprocal tariffs on some Canadian goods, despite previously delaying the 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods for a month. MORE: The uncertainty of tariffs weighed on markets, as the S&P 500 recorded its worst weekly loss since September, declining 3.1%. More than $3 trillion in market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its February 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data. Mark Carney will replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister, and was critical of President Donald Trump in his victory speech on Sunday night. Carney, an economist who previously served as the governor of both Canada and England’s central banks, won with nearly 86% of the Canadian Liberal Party’s leadership vote, and vowed to keep retaliatory tariffs in place “until the Americans show us respect.” Cracks are starting to show in the labor market, as fewer jobs were added than expected last month, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in February, and government jobs fell by about 10,000, though the March report is more likely to be impacted by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts due to the timing of the February survey. William Lansing took over as CEO of credit scoring company FICO in 2012, when the business was still recovering from the financial crisis. In 13 years, he’s made a bundle for long-term shareholders and himself an almost-billionaire, largely by pushing through margin fattening price increases. The once secretive analytics company has become a consumer brand that anyone looking to finance a car or home obsesses over. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY APU GOMES/GETTY IMAGES; JAAP ARRIENS/NURPHOTO; WANG ZHAO/AFP; HANNES P ALBERT/PICTURE ALLIANCE Elon Musk claims Tesla is not an electric car maker, but rather an AI company that can become the most valuable in the world—thanks to the data it collects from its cars. In theory, it could help train vehicles to operate without human assistance, but that data isn’t necessarily as helpful as Musk claims: Training AI on videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle the most critical edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios. Federal investigators suspect that hackers of password manager LastPass caused one victim to lose XRP cryptocurrency that is now worth some $716 million, due to a massive spike in crypto values following the election of President Donald Trump. It’s already been a big year for massive crypto thefts, after hackers stole $1.5 billion from the ByBit exchange in February, in what was dubbed the biggest crypto heist in history. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and other insiders at Dominari Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed wealth management firm, acquired 1 million company shares through a private placement and bonuses—the day before it was announced that the Trump brothers would join its advisory board. The timing probably does not violate insider trading laws, experts told Forbes, but raises questions about whether directors acted in the company’s best interests by selling the shares cheaply to themselves. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday sent a letter to President Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and asked him to make his financial disclosures with the government public, days after Trump announced the creation of an American crypto strategic reserve. In her letter, Warren asked how Sacks intends to prevent “the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.” The latest casualty of DOGE’s work is Notify.gov, a federal system designed to send mass texts to the public, and it’s in imminent danger of shutting down, according to publicly-available proposed changes to its website. The tool is used by governments at all levels to send out important warnings and reminders to citizens, but sources tell Forbes most of the team that manages it have been “fired, transferred, or have resigned.” The CDC is planning to study potential connections between vaccines and autism, a link that has been pushed controversially by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures spreading the long-debunked theory for years, and health experts have widely condemned his stance. MORE: Health officials in Maryland reported a positive measles case in a resident who had traveled internationally last week, unrelated to outbreaks of the disease in Texas and New Mexico. Measles was announced as being eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, given the success of vaccines in eliminating the disease, though outbreaks of the virus have still popped up among the unvaccinated. President Donald Trump said Friday he is considering new “large-scale” sanctions and tariffs on Russia to compel an end the Russia-Ukraine war, but hours later, he said “it may be easier dealing with Russia” compared to Ukraine. The warnings contradict a Reuters report earlier last week that the White House was considering easing sanctions against Russia to improve relations as it works to negotiate a ceasefire and permanent end to the conflict. “One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.” TOPLINE Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares’ quest to sell what he considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand for nearly a decade. Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target, as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across grocery store soup aisles industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category. Despite its growth, Mares wants the company to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of independent board member Sam McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue. With that kind of momentum behind Mares, he is now emboldened to scale up his business and begin selling what he deems as healthier food on a mass scale. “I have a vision much more than an investor does around what the food system should look like,” he says. “With what I want to build in the world, it’s much easier to realize your vision if you have more control.” WHY IT MATTERS Kettle & Fire cooks its products for 14 to 20 hours and sources grassfed beef with a strict set of standards to ensure high levels of collagen, amino acids, and vitamins and minerals. Mares and his team also remove the kinds of additives and ingredients like seed oils targeted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again crowd. Kennedy has touted the benefits of bone broth on social media, and podcaster Joe Rogan, who has extolled the benefits of the carnivore diet for years, is also a big fan of bone broth. MORE Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Retailers shed among the most jobs of any private-sector industry last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that could be just the tip of the iceberg: 6,300: The number of jobs the retail industry lost in February, second only to food services and drinking establishments, which lost 27,500 positions 19,000: The number of jobs cost from the bankruptcy of crafts retailer Joann, and another 16,000 jobs were lost from Party City Up to 15,000: The number of stores that retailers are expected to close this year, more than double the amount that closed in 2024 With all the talk of tariffs, layoffs and more, economic uncertainty is bound to cause stress. Focus on the things you can control: For instance, come up with a Plan B, like a side hustle to earn extra income. Exercise self-care and immerse yourself in the things that bring you joy, and don’t leave your financial situation up to chance—keep track of the money coming in and out. And remember that the unknown can have positive outcomes, too. A pop star who rose to fame in 2008 released a new album last week, which soared to the top of the charts. Who is it? A. Rihanna B. Taylor Swift C. Lady Gaga D. Beyoncé Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

Title: Walgreens heading down a very risky path | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Walgreens has been attempting a financial turnaround for years, and now it says it’s found a new path to finish it. But if history is any guide, its path is more likely to lead to its eventual demise than long-term success. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which owns drugstores in both the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico and Thailand, announced last week that it would be ending a century as a publicly traded company, and would be sold to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Less than a decade ago it was America’s largest drugstore chain, and its stock was successful enough to replace iconic conglomerate General Electric in the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 companies selected for their importance to the economy and the overall market. But its shares have lost 83% of their value since that day, with a 71% plunge coming in just the last four years. And it would have lost more than that, if it wasn’t for investors looking ahead to the sale to Sycamore, which lifted shares more than 7% in Friday trading. Sycamore and Walgreens have both insisted the purchase will allow for the company, which has already closed many of its stores, to complete the turnaround more quickly. “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,” said Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth. “Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.” Related article Walgreens is going private in an up to $24 billion deal But despite the promise, retail’s graveyard is full of the bones of many once-dominant retailers who closed up shop after being bought by private equity firms. The list includes Toys R Us, Sports Authority and RadioShack — all once leaders in their fields. Even some companies that survived being taken private that survived, such as Aeropostale, did so only after a trip through bankruptcy court. Not all retailers taken private have failed. Some, such as Sycamore-owned Staples, continue to do well. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that this is the right solution, said Mark Cohen, the former head of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “Intellectually it sounds like a good idea to relieve a company of the quarter-to-quarter need to satisfy shareholders and instead focus on long-term success,” said Cohen. “But from a historical point of view, most of these deals result in the company circling the drain.” The private equity business model often relies upon forcing the company to take on massive amounts of debt to give the greatest possible return to the private equity firm, with the long-term survival of the business often not a priority. The debt is often used to pay “special dividends” to the firm itself to cover the initial purchase price, as well as heavy “management fees” placed on the company, to be paid to the private equity firm. Many times brick-and-mortar retail chains have been forced to sell off the buildings that house their stores and pay rents that they can’t afford to new owners, leading to even more store closings and layoffs. Neither Sycamore nor Walgreens had a comment when asked about the history of retailers closing after being taken private. As of last August, Walgreens had about 8,500 stores in the United States, and 3,700 foreign locations. That’s down by about 1,000 American stores and 1,000 foreign stores from where it stood when it joined the Dow in 2018. There are more store closings to come, as the company announced plans in October to shutter another 1,200 stores. Related article Walgreens admits locking up shampoo and toothpaste hurts sales. But it’s still doing it Walgreens itself was booted from the Dow a year ago and replaced by Amazon, which is providing its own growing competition with an online pharmacy. Walgreens has been passed by CVS as the nation’s largest drugstore chain. Both Walgreens and CVS and rival Rite-Aid have been struggling due to lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, hurting the pharmacy business in the back of the store, and growing competition not just from Amazon but from big-box retailers such as Walmart and Target, which often sell the same items as those in the front of stores. Whether or not Sycamore can fix the problems with Walgreens, it is likely to do well in the deal, considering it is getting the chain at a fraction of its former value and because of the way the deals are structured to benefit the private equity buyers, said Cohen. “The pathway to heaven is to fix the business and then take it public and make an enormous amount of money because you’re the shareholder,” Cohen said. But that’s not often the way things play out. “The typical pathway is to milk the business for as long as you can, then break it up and dispose of it,” Cohen added. The fundamental problems leading to the private equity purchase don’t go away with this deal, according to Cohen. “What is it about this transaction that is going to result in the recovery of this? In my opinion, nothing. Are they fundamentally going to be better able to compete with CVS or Amazon? No. Will they be able rationalize the behavior they’ve had to engage in of locking up toothpaste, rather than find some other way to protect their inventory, causing customers to run, not walk to Amazon? No,” he said. “The net of this is it’s just deck chairs on the Titanic being moved around.” CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: 3 major risks could send the stock market tumbling even further

Stocks have endured a bumpy period over the last few weeks amid a chaotic start to President Donald Trump's second term. Since February 19, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Most Wall Street estimates remain positive, but investors worry that three key risks could send stocks tumbling even further. Fears that the US economy is heading toward a recession have resurfaced in recent weeks. After a false alarm in 2022 and 2024, signals of potential labor market softening have again fueled worries of a downturn. "Both WARN and Challenger data point to a further rise in private sector layoffs to come in March, and growing anxiety in the consumer confidence surveys about the future health of the labor market usually is a reliable sign of rising joblessness to come too," said Samuel Tombs, Chief US Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on Friday. Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro, also said in a client note on Friday that the weakness is likely to continue. One reason for this is that state and local government spending on salaries is dipping sharply, as is spending on construction wages, a leading indicator. Spending in these areas has fallen during prior downturns. "I don't see an end unless the Fed takes steps to lift demand," he said in a note on Friday. Investors were tuned into February's non-farm payroll report on Friday morning for clues about where the labor market is headed. They didn't get much insight as the US economy added 151,000 jobs, near expectations, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly inched up to 4.1%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the US economy remains solid, sending stocks climbing. But Trump's on-and-off implementation of tariffs has added another level of uncertainty to economic growth, Wall Street banks say. Firms like Apollo, BCA Research, and TD Cowen have all warned of the rising likelihood of recession thanks to tariffs. Goldman Sachs on Friday also raised its recession odds for the next 12 months from 15% to 20% due to tariffs, but acknowledged the import fees could be reversed. "We have raised it by only a limited amount at this point because we see policy changes as the key risk, and the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious," Jan Hatzius, the bank's chief US economist, said in a note. "If policy headed in the direction of our risk scenario or if the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further." On the flip side of tariff-related recession worries are concerns that the import taxes will drive up consumer goods prices. So, even if the economy is resilient, rising prices could lead the Fed to hike rates again, creating downward pressure on stocks and on consumers. Or an even worse situation could arise: prices could surge due to tariffs while the economy continues to weaken. "Tariffs are a self-inflicted stagflationary policy for the U.S. economy that was otherwise poised to continue growing at a solid pace," said Phill Colmar, managing partner and global strategist at MRB Partners, in a note Friday. "The U.S. exceptionalism theme will continue to unwind, and U.S. equities are not yet priced for downside growth risks." Inflation has seen a slight resurgence in recent months, rising from 2.4% in September to 3% in January. The Fed is expected to implement two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. Outside of the shaky macroeconomic picture, the mega-cap AI stocks that drive broader stock-market indexes could continue to suffer. That's because their strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure has come into question after the release of a cheaper and more energy-efficient chatbot from Chinese firm Deepseek. Investors have suddenly been made to wonder if the valuations these stocks have commanded on the promise of impressive future growth are justified. The paradigm shift has been painful for US AI stocks. Year-to-date, shares of Nvidia are down 18.5%, Microsoft is down 6%, Amazon is down 9.5%, and Alphabet has dropped 7.8%. Meanwhile, Chinese AI stocks have rallied: shares of Alibaba, who also released a relatively inexpensive chatbot, are up 65% year-to-date, while JD.com and Tencent have risen 23% and 28%, respectively. "AI is here to stay, and if anything, DeepSeek reinforces that. However, the latest developments do also show that investment approaches that are too concentrated or overly passive can be risky, as value can quickly shift within the AI ecosystem," said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a January 28 note. "An active and diversified approach is a better way to gain exposure to AI, in our view." Jump to

Title: The tariff fight is far from over

Happy Friday! If you're grabbing an Uber or Lyft this weekend and a Tesla shows up, do yourself a favor and don't bring up Elon Musk. Whether you love him or hate him, chances are your driver doesn't want to talk about it. (And if you insist on doing it, they'll probably just say what they think will get them the best tip.) In today's big story, tariffs against Canada and Mexico have been mostly delayed by a month in yet another turnaround in the ongoing trade war. What's on deck Markets: One betting market has the odds of a US recession at 32%. Tech: Microsoft is talking up a massive quantum-computing breakthrough. Amazon execs aren't buying it. Business: Some senators want to take a closer look at X's advertising tactics. But first, another postponement. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. So, about those tariffs… Two days after implementing a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods, President Donald Trump is pulling a U-turn. The president announced a one-month pause on tariffs for both countries' imports that fall under an agreement called USMCA. If you're a bit rusty on your global trade regulations, USMCA was the trade deal that Trump negotiated between the US, Canada, and Mexico to replace NAFTA. The trade pact covers most goods, making Trump's announcement almost equivalent to the monthlong pause on tariffs he initiated in February. The offer didn't extend to the other target of Trump's tariffs, China, which has issued retaliatory tariffs. There's long been speculation that Trump's tariffs were merely a negotiation tactic to get better trade terms from other countries. And the president's willingness to issue another reprieve from his trade taxes could be proof of that. But the market's willingness to accept the ongoing uncertainty might only extend so far. Investors are already on edge as fears of a potential recession start to bubble up. Stocks rebounded on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted a resolution to the tariff situation could be coming. But despite the official announcement on Thursday, stocks finished down considerably. The S&P 500 closed 1.78% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.61%. Trump's flip-flopping may not pay off in the long term. That's according to supply chain and conflict resolution scholars, who said his tariff tensions are eroding the US's relationships with its allies. Things aren't likely to calm down in the meantime. The February jobs report comes out this morning. It will help inform the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on March 19, which is less than two weeks away. And the fight over tariffs is far from over. Canada and Mexico's postponement is only until April 2. That also coincides with the kickoff of more tariffs. This time they're targeting foreign agricultural goods and other products. Trump also mentioned South Korea, India, and the European Union over what he said were unfair trade relations. There's no shortage of experts weighing in on what it all means. If you want to sound smart about the Trump tariffs, here are some of the best thinkers to follow. Sorry, American firms, the AI trade has moved to China. 1. Economists and betting markets agree: Odds of a recession are rising. The chance of a US recession jumped to 32% on Thursday on Polymarket, up 23% from late February. Wall Street economists say the reason is Trump-shaped — the administration's unpredictable policy moves could shake consumer confidence to the core. 2. Inside "Project Voyage," Goldman Sachs' grand plan to thin its ranks, cut costs. In addition to moving the bank's annual culling of underperformers up the calendar, CEO David Solomon plans to relocate employees from New York City to lower-cost areas like Dallas and Salt Lake City, people familiar with the program told BI. One former employee said Project Voyage is a multi-year plan, and you can expect these divisions to be the most impacted. 3. How much do investment bankers really make? As Wall Street waits to see if a dealmaking rebound will fully materialize this year, recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners heard from over 900 investment bankers on how much they earned in 2024. Check out some of the survey's highlights. 1. The petition to standardize closed captions. BI's Katie Notopoulos has a bone to pick with streaming services: Captions are too hard to figure out. Every streamer has a different interface, posing a challenge for the 63% of Americans under 30 who prefer subtitles. Maybe you're swiping up, but what if it's actually down? Perhaps you accidentally click the dreaded "Play from the Beginning" button in the process. She thinks it's all too much, and it's also an accessibility issue. 2. Amazon calls BS on Microsoft's quantum-computing claims. In an email to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon's head of quantum tech expressed doubts that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum computing chip could do all it was hyped up to do, according to a copy of the email obtained by BI. Industry experts said tech companies might be generating more hype than substance in their attempts to outdo each other in the field. 3. The shortcut for cheap AI. Distillation — using one model to improve another — has more potential today than ever, thanks to the plethora of open-source models that can serve as "teachers." While some developers celebrate the concept, the big AI companies behind foundation models need to justify and protect their pricey offerings. 1. These senators want an investigation into Elon Musk's X. Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Adam Schiff, and Chris Van Hollen are calling for a DOJ probe into X. Specifically, they want to know if X is leveraging Musk's political status to pressure companies into advertising on the social media platform, referencing an article from The Wall Street Journal article last month. Read the letters they sent to the DOJ and the FTC. 2. Playing dress up with an AI twist. Fashion app Doji uses AI to help users virtually try on clothes, and early beta testers are loving it. One fan is none other than Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who's also backing it through his venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. 3. Social Security employees can't read news sites at work anymore. As the Trump administration continues restructuring the Social Security Administration, a recent agency-wide email announced new browsing restrictions for employees' work computers. Restrictions prohibit workers from checking the news, online shopping, and visiting sports sites. According to the email, the goal is to limit risk and protect sensitive information.

Title: Ties between The Trade Desk and key media agencies are weakening

Time Published: 2025-03-07T05:01:00Z

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail The Trade Desk (TTD) and media agencies are drifting apart — a conscious uncoupling that crept in slowly but is now moving fast. Agencies say their spending isn’t climbing like it used to, while The Trade Desk is busy chasing direct deals with advertisers. It’s not a full on breakup yet, but both sides are clearly eyeing other options. One holding company media buyer, who exchanged anonymity for candor, told Digiday that rising client investment in CTV — and the many DSPs that can be used to place such spend — meant their agency was becoming less reliant on The Trade Desk over time. “We’ve had — we have — a great relationship with TTD. I just think that the dominance of the inventory that they represent is less and less important,” said the buyer. That sentiment has only grown louder over the past two years as media agencies have taken more control over programmatic ad buying. Once content to let ad tech players like The Trade Desk handle it, agencies have been pushed by advertisers to step up, building out their own tech and services to optimize ad buying. Naturally, that shift pulled them away from The Trade Desk and closer to the other power players in the auction: supply-side platforms, which hold the data and tech agencies need to secure the best ad impressions. In addition, there’s concerns among some media buyers over rising data fees and dwindling transparency around the ways its products work. “Those things add up to the point where it may be less expensive to run [a campaign] through a walled garden or another platform,” said Jonathan D’Souza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler. In turn these frustrations are starting to influence where advertisers choose to spend their dollars. Indeed, media agency execs say their dependence on it is slipping as client investments bend toward channels that The Trade Desk doesn’t dominate in, namely CTV where, despite its expertise, there’s competition. Viant, for example, saw overall revenues increased 30% in 2024. According to co-founder and COO Chris Vanderhook, that was due to a “massive tailwind” from CTV demand. It’s a thought not lost on the execs at Amazon Ads, who are using the promise of CTV advertising powered by its rich data as a hook to convince more advertisers to use its own DSP. So far, it appears to be working. The company raked in $17.3 billion in ad revenue last quarter, a 17% rise driven by its DSP’s growth. As Digiday previously reported, it’s beginning to encroach upon established ad tech players and, in time, is expected to provide serious competition for The Trade Desk. “Amazon’s DSP has come a long way, and a lot of that has to do with… their market dominance, their data, their commerce solution, their proprietary inventory,” said one anonymous buyer. “They are coming for The Trade Desk.” These tensions are mounting as The Trade Desk’s grip on ad dollars faces pressure from three sides: a fragmented CTV market, the slow death of third-party cookies that fuel its audience targeting and the looming risk that their disappearance could dent its buying efficiency in key areas. After the firm’s recent earnings brought The Trade Desk its first revenue miss in 33 straight quarters, chief exec Jeff Green told analysts that the company had overhauled its client-facing teams as part of a 15-point plan to regain momentum. That included layoffs (it’s unclear how many precisely) and a reorientation of some teams around clients and business verticals; the company’s jobs board currently includes several openings for director and manager positions focused on managing brand relationships. In addition, Green said TTD planned to pursue more joint business plans (JBPs) — direct arrangements struck with big advertisers. A Trade Desk spokesperson referred Digiday to remarks Green made during TTD’s most recent earnings call in a request for comment — during which, Green claimed that TTD’s brand direct relationships were growing 50% faster than other parts of the business. This not so subtle push to cozy up to agency clients directly might look like a threat, but it’s arguably the least important factor at play. The Trade Desk’s pursuit of more top advertiser partnerships isn’t expected to be an issue, given clients will still typically ask agencies to execute and advise on investments. “JBPs are not a threat to the way agencies work,” said one buyer, who asked to remain anonymous, citing continued existing relationships with The Trade Desk. Even recent structural shake-ups within the company’s agency team aren’t seen as something that will escalate tensions with agencies — at least no higher than they already are. In fact The Trade Desk’s day-to-day relationship with agencies appears to still be relatively healthy, especially those outside the holdco groups, according to five buyers that spoke with Digiday. For instance, at indie shop Wpromote, head of media investment Deanna Mulkeen described TTD’s DSP as “a critical part of our media mix … Nobody is perfect, but I think The Trade Desk has been really strong for us.” And for many advertisers, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. According to Ryan Eusanio, svp, video and programmatic at Omnicom Media Group, most clients will utilize multiple DSPs according to their media needs. An advertiser focusing on YouTube might adopt DV360 as a “primary” platform and use another as its “secondary”, he said. “A lot of our clients use [The Trade Desk] as a primary DSP. They’ve been an industry leader in the CTV space for a very long time, [and] we’ve built a lot of co-developed capabilities with them,” he explained. The real question, though, is how far that collaboration with agencies will go. The Trade Desk remains the preeminent gateway to the open web for many. But when growth is on the line, partnerships often take a back seat. The Trade Desk quells talk of full URL-level campaign reporting (similar to Amazon), but there are nuances. The Dentsu media agency’s three new leaders bring broader more traditional chops to widen out the agency’s ability to deliver up and down the funnel for its clients. Nothing is decided yet, but if Coca-Cola does opt for a change then Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth close to $1 billion.

Posted on 03/06/2025 11:52:42 AM PST by Miami Rebel President Donald Trump convened his Cabinet in person on Thursday to deliver a message: You’re in charge of your departments, not Elon Musk. According to two administration officials, Trump told top members of his administration that Musk was empowered to make recommendations to the departments but not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy. Musk was also in the room. The meeting followed a series of mass firings and threats to government workers from the billionaire Tesla founder, who helms the Department of Government Efficiency, that created broad uncertainty across the federal government and its workforce. DOGE’s actions have faced ferocious resistance in court and criticism from Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans.

According to Trump’s new guidance, DOGE and its staff should play an advisory role — but Cabinet secretaries should make final decisions on personnel, policy and the pacing of implementation. Musk joined the conversation and indicated he was on board with Trump’s directive. According to one person familiar with the meeting, Musk acknowledged that DOGE had made some missteps — a message he shared earlier this week with members of Congress. Trump stressed that he wants to keep good people in government and not to eject capable federal workers en masse. But his administration has in recent weeks fired tens of thousands of federal workers across numerous agencies in a series of blanket terminations. A federal judge and the chair of a federal civil service board have both concluded that the terminations were not tied to performance issues — and may have violated civil service laws.

Title: Software engineers at Google, Microsoft, and more share their best tips for landing a coding job in tech

Time Published: 2025-03-06T17:21:43Z

Working as a software engineer isn't what it used to be — but those working in the industry have some tips for getting ahead in the increasingly crowded job market. The software engineering industry is going through a major shift driven by the adoption of AI, which has led to fewer job postings, layoffs, and evolving responsibilities for those still working in the field. In early to mid-2022, there were three times as many software engineering roles listed on Indeed. This chart shows just how much the opportunity landscape has changed. As AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or Replit have become more prominent, a large part of the job has become automated. In Salesforce's most recent earnings call, its CEO Marc Benioff said the company is seeing a "30% productivity increase in engineering" and won't "hire any new engineers this year" in the wake of those gains. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call in 2024 that over a quarter of the company's code is generated by AI before being checked by employees. A manager at Microsoft similarly shared that AI reduced 70% of the time he used to spend on coding, although he noted that his daily workload hasn't been reduced. That's because software engineers do more than just code. For newer entrants to the field, though, the opportunities are narrowing, and some have struggled to get the foundational skills needed to move up. Some recent software engineering grads have said they sent hundreds of job applications with minimal responses. That's led some to pursue a "panic Master's" degree to put off the hunt. It's not all doom and gloom, though. Automating coding tasks has increased the demand for developers to leverage their creativity and experience. Here's some of the advice from industry veterans and tech CEOs on how to improve your odds of getting a job in the field — and success stories from those who have done it. Jump to

It is sustained by the pursuit of what Michael Lewis once called the “new new thing.” The Internet, the smartphone, social media: the new new thing cannot be a modest tweak at the edges. It has to transform the human race. The economic incentives are clear: a firm that popularizes a paradigm-shattering invention can make a lot of money. But there is also something larger at stake. If Silicon Valley doesn’t keep delivering new new things, it loses its privileged status as the place where the future is made. In 2022 the industry was having a bad year. After a lucrative pandemic—the five most valuable tech companies added more than $2.6 trillion to their combined market capitalization in 2020 and nearly the same amount in 2021—the sector suffered one of its sharpest-ever contractions. Amazon lost almost half of its value, Meta close to two thirds. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 33 percent, its worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. The reasons were straightforward enough. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero, and people stayed home, where they spent more time and money online. By 2022 both trends were in reverse. Most Americans had decided to stop worrying about the virus and were happily resuming their offline activities. Meanwhile the Fed began hiking interest rates in response to rising inflation. It would be a mistake to overstate the severity of the “tech downturn” that followed. Despite mass layoffs and declining revenue, the big firms remained larger and more profitable than they had been before the pandemic. Nonetheless a certain malaise had set in. The industry needed a dazzling new invention that could attract billions of consumers and send capital markets into a froth. One candidate was Web3, a proposal for rebuilding the Internet around blockchain, the accounting technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Championed in particular by venture capitalists, who hoped that it would enrich them by empowering a new generation of start-ups to unseat the big firms, Web3 never proved useful for anything except speculation, and even the speculators got soaked as various schemes imploded under the pressure of high interest rates. Another possibility was the metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg’s dream of an immersive Internet experienced through a VR headset. It, too, struggled to demonstrate any practical advantage. Worse, it was unpleasant: a glitchy simulacrum of a postapocalyptic shopping mall as designed by David Lynch, where fish-eyed avatars with no legs floated through sparsely populated cartoon worlds. Then, on November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT. A powerful AI system paired with an affable conversational interface, it let anyone ask a question and get an impressively humanoid (though not always correct) response. By January 2023 the chatbot had amassed 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing Web application ever. It was storybook Silicon Valley: OpenAI, which at the time had only a few hundred employees, caught everyone by surprise and, virtually overnight, established “generative AI”—the category of software to which ChatGPT belongs—as the new master concept of the entire industry. The tech giants rushed to respond, setting off a stampede. Everything from search engines to e-mail clients began sprouting generative AI features. In 2023 the Nasdaq climbed 55 percent, its best performance since 1999. The new new thing had been found. It’s too soon to know whether generative AI will prove to be a pot of gold or a blast of hot air. Opinions are divided. Some companies have done fabulously well: Nvidia, the boom’s breakout star, is raking it in, since its chips are the basic infrastructure on which generative AI is built. The cloud divisions of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have also grown considerably, which their executives attribute to increased demand for AI services. But these are, in the parlance of the financial press, “picks and shovels” plays. Nobody doubts that there is money to be made from selling companies the paraphernalia they need to use generative AI. The real question is whether generative AI helps those companies make any money themselves. Skeptics point out that the high cost of creating and running generative AI software is a potential obstacle. This negates the traditional advantage of digital technology: its low marginal costs. Starting an online bookstore worked for Amazon because it was cheaper than going the brick-and-mortar route, as Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, noted in a June 2024 report. AI, by contrast, is not cheap—which means “AI applications must solve extremely complex and important problems for enterprises to earn an appropriate return on investment.” Covello, for one, doubts that they will. Yet companies, like people, are not entirely rational. When a firm decides to adopt a new technology, it rarely does so on the basis of economic considerations alone. “Such decisions are more often than not grounded upon hunches, faith, ego, delight, and deals,” observes the historian David Noble. Looking at American factories after World War II, Noble identified a number of reasons for their shift to “numerical control” technology: a “fascination with automation,” a devotion to the idea of technological progress, an urge to be associated with the prestige of the cutting edge, and a “fear of falling behind the competition,” among others.1 Advertisement Noble does, however, put special emphasis on one motivation that is at least partly rooted in economic rationality: labor discipline. By mechanizing the production process, managers could more fully master the workers within it. The philosopher Matteo Pasquinelli takes a similar view in his recent book The Eye of the Master: A Social History of Artificial Intelligence. In the introduction, Pasquinelli, a professor at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, explains that he won’t be offering a “linear history of mathematical achievements.” Rather, he wants to provide a “social genealogy” that treats AI not merely as a technological pursuit but “as a vision of the world.” The centerpiece of this vision is the automation—and domination—of labor. Contemporary AI is best understood, he believes, as the latest in a long line of efforts to increase the power of the boss. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith famously argued that the manufacture of pins could be made more efficient through the division of labor. Instead of having a single pinmaker do everything, you could break the job down into several distinct tasks and distribute them to make pins more quickly. This is the canonical principle of capitalist production and the one that automation epitomizes and enforces. First you make work more mechanical, then you delegate it to machines. An important popularizer of this principle was Charles Babbage, a central figure in Pasquinelli’s book. Originally a mathematician, Babbage became what we would now call a “thought leader” among the nineteenth-century British bourgeoisie. Today he is better known as one of the inventors of the computer. His work on computation began with the observation that the division of labor could be “applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations,” as he stated in an influential 1832 treatise. The same method of industrial management then remolding the British worker could be transported outside of the factory and applied to a very different kind of labor, Babbage believed: mathematical calculation. He took inspiration from Gaspard de Prony, a French mathematician who came up with a scheme for streamlining the creation of logarithmic tables by reducing most of the work to a series of simple additions and subtractions. In de Prony’s arrangement, a handful of experts and managers planned the job and did the more difficult calculations while an army of menial number crunchers did lots of basic arithmetic. If the poor grunts at the bottom of this pyramid were basically automatons, why not automate them? In the factory the division of labor went hand in hand with automation. In fact, according to Babbage, it was precisely the simplification of the labor process that made it possible to introduce machinery. “When each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool,” he wrote, “the union of all these tools, actuated by one moving power, constitutes a machine.” In 1819 he began designing what he called the Difference Engine, which automated the labor of arithmetic with three rotating cylinders and was powered by a steam engine. Babbage’s ambition was enormous. He wanted to “establish the business of calculation at an industrial scale,” Pasquinelli writes, by harnessing the same energy source that was revolutionizing British industry. The mass production of error-free logarithmic tables would also make for a profitable business, because such tables allowed the United Kingdom’s formidable mercantile and military fleets to determine their position at sea. The British government, recognizing the economic and geopolitical value of Babbage’s venture, provided funding. The investment failed. Babbage managed to construct a small prototype, but the full design proved too complicated to implement. In 1842 the government pulled its support, by which point Babbage had begun dreaming of an even less buildable machine: the Analytical Engine. Designed with the help of the mathematician Ada Lovelace, this extraordinary mechanism would have been the first general-purpose computer, able to be programmed to perform any calculation. Thus, amid the smog and soot of Victorian England, the idea of software was born. The division of labor was never just about efficiency; it was also about control. By fragmenting craft production—picture a shoemaker making a pair of shoes—into a set of modular routines, the division of labor eliminated the autonomy of the artisan. Now management brought workers together under a single roof, which meant they could be told what to do and watched while they did it. Advertisement Pasquinelli believes that Babbage’s engines, originating as they did in a “project to mechanize the division of mental labor,” were driven by the same managerial imperatives. They were, he writes, “an implementation of the analytical eye of the factory’s master,” a sort of mechanical representation of the watchful, despotic boss. Pasquinelli goes so far as to call them “cousins” of Jeremy Bentham’s notorious panopticon. But these imperatives presumably remained latent, since the gadgets never worked as designed. Babbage tried to use mechanical gears to represent decimal numbers, which meant he struggled with the problem of how to automate the “carryover”—the process whereby one column resets to zero and the next column increases by one—when a digit reaches 10. It would take the simplifications of the binary system, the invention of electronics, and the many advances bankrolled by the ample military budgets of World War II to make automatic computation finally feasible in the 1940s. By then capitalism had become a more international affair, which made the matter of managing workers more complicated. “The more the division of labor extended into a globalized world,” Pasquinelli writes, “the more troublesome its management became,” as “the ‘intelligence’ of the factory’s master could no longer survey the entire production process in a single glance.” Thus, he contends, the need for “infrastructures of communication” that “could achieve this role of supervision and quantification.” The modern computer, in the decades following its arrival in the 1940s, helped satisfy this need. Computers extended the “eye of the master” across space, Pasquinelli argues, enabling capitalists to coordinate the increasingly cumbersome logistics of industrial production. If Babbage had wanted to construct a prosthesis with which to project managerial power, as Pasquinelli suggests, then computation’s triumph in the twentieth century as the indispensable instrument of capitalist globalization should be understood as a fulfillment of the technology’s founding spirit. Moreover, this spirit appears to have intensified as computers continued to evolve. “Since the end of the twentieth century,” Pasquinelli writes, the management of labor has turned all of society into a “digital factory” and has taken the form of the software of search engines, online maps, messaging apps, social networks, gig-economy platforms, mobility services, and ultimately AI algorithms. AI, he concludes, is accelerating this transformation. There is no doubt that computers are often used to the advantage of employers, from the scheduling software that reduces labor costs by saddling retail and restaurant workers with unpredictable schedules to the several species of “bossware” that enable the remote surveillance and supervision of office employees, Uber drivers, and long-haul truckers. But to argue that such uses are the raison d’être of digital technology, as Pasquinelli seems to, is to overstate the case. Labor discipline is one use to which computers can be put; there are many others. And it was not central to the technology’s development: the core innovations of computing arose in response to military prerogatives, not economic ones. The desires to crack enemy cryptography, calculate the correct angles for aiming artillery, and perform the math necessary for making the hydrogen bomb were a few of the motivations for building computers in the 1940s. The US government became infatuated with the technology and spent millions on research and procurement in the subsequent decades. Computers would prove integral to a variety of imperial pursuits, from assembling intercontinental missiles capable of (precisely) incinerating millions of Soviets to storing and analyzing intercepts sourced from listening stations around the world. American corporations followed behind, adapting the contraptions cooked up by the security state to various commercial ends. Still, if Pasquinelli’s claims do not always convince, there is much to learn from the material he presents. Publishers have inundated readers with books about AI in recent years—enough to fill a small bookstore.2 Most have an undercooked quality. The Eye of the Master is, if anything, overcooked: there is an enormous amount of thinking compressed into its pages. Pasquinelli’s omnivorous intellect often mesmerizes. Nonetheless, I sometimes found myself wishing he would slow down to scaffold his provocations with more evidence. The fact that Babbage drew from the playbook of industrial management in designing his protocomputers is an interesting piece of history. But its relevance to later developments, or even just its resonance with them, can be determined only by looking closely at how computers actually transformed work in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which Pasquinelli does not do. Instead he takes a sharp turn halfway through the book, pivoting from nineteenth-century industrial Britain to the early AI researchers of mid-twentieth-century America, focusing in particular on the field’s “connectionist” school. Connectionism, as Pasquinelli notes, departed in significant ways from the automatic computation of Babbage. For Babbage the soul of the computer was the algorithm, a step-by-step procedure that traditionally makes up the principal ingredient of a computer program. When Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and others created the modern computer in the twentieth century, what they created was a device for executing algorithms. The programmer writes a set of rules for transforming an input into an output, and the computer obeys. This ethos also guided “symbolic AI,” the philosophy that came to dominate the first generation of AI research. Its adherents believed that by programming a computer to follow a series of rules they could turn a machine into a mind. This method had its limits. Formalizing an activity as a logical sequence works fine if the activity is relatively simple. As it becomes more complex, however, hard-coded instructions are less useful. I could give you an exact set of directions for driving from my house to yours, but I couldn’t use the same technique to tell you how to drive. An alternative approach emerged from cybernetics, a postwar intellectual movement with extremely eclectic interests. Among these was the aspiration to create automata with the adaptability of living things. “Rather than imitating the rules of human reasoning,” Pasquinelli writes, the cyberneticians “aimed at imitating the rules by which organisms organize themselves and adapt to the environment.” These efforts led to the invention of the artificial neural network, a data-processing architecture loosely modeled on the brain. By using such networks to perceive patterns in data, computers can train themselves in a particular task. A neural network learns to do things not by simplifying a process into a procedure but by observing a process—again and again and again—and drawing statistical relationships across the many examples. One of connectionism’s progenitors was Friedrich Hayek, the subject of Pasquinelli’s most intriguing chapter. Hayek is best known as a leading theorist of neoliberalism, but as a young man he developed an interest in the brain while working in the Zurich lab of the famous neuropathologist Constantin von Monakow. For Hayek the mind was like a market: he saw both as self-organizing entities from which a spontaneous order arises through the decentralized interaction of their components. These ideas would help influence the development of artificial neural networks, which in fact function much like the market mind of the Hayekian imagination. When a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt implemented the first neural network with the help of a navy grant in 1957, he acknowledged his debt to Hayek. But Hayek also diverged from the cyberneticians in important respects. Cybernetics, as the philosopher Norbert Wiener defined it in his eponymous 1948 book, involved the scientific study of “control and communication in the animal and the machine.” The term, coined by Wiener, was derived from the ancient Greek word for the steersman of a ship, which shares the same root as the word for government. The cyberneticians wanted to create technological systems that could govern themselves—a prospect that appealed to a Pentagon looking for ways to gain a military advantage in the cold war. The navy funded Rosenblatt in the hopes that his neural network could assist in “the automation of target classification,” Pasquinelli explains, by using its powers of pattern recognition to detect enemy vessels. For Hayek, by contrast, connectionism offered a way to think about a system that eluded control. He had a special kind of control in mind: economic planning. In his view, the brainlike complexity and distributed architecture of the market meant that socialism could never work. Thus the need for neoliberal policies that, in the words of the historian Quinn Slobodian, would “encase the unknowable economy,” protecting it from government interference.3 Nonetheless, Hayek and the other connectionists were very much on the same team. Rosenblatt and his colleagues were able to secure funding for their research because the US government believed their ideas could help defeat socialist armies. Hayek was in the business of defeating socialist ideas. At first, connectionism failed to fulfill its promise. By the early 1970s it had fallen out of favor in the AI world. Still, neural networks continued to develop quietly over the subsequent decades, enjoying some breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s. Then, in the 2010s, came connectionism’s quantum leap. Training a neural network, as Rosenblatt once pointed out, requires “exposure to a large sample of stimuli.” Size matters: since neural networks learn by studying data, how much they can learn depends in part on the quantity of data available to them. For much of computing’s history, data was expensive to store and difficult to transmit. By the second decade of the twenty-first century, both barriers had dissolved. Plummeting storage costs, combined with the birth and growth of the Web, meant that a mountain of words, photos, and videos was accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Researchers used this information to train neural networks. The abundance of training data, along with new techniques and more powerful hardware, led to swift progress in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. Today AI based on neural networks is ubiquitous, at work in everything from Siri to self-driving cars to the algorithms that curate social media feeds. Neural networks also underpin generative AI systems like ChatGPT. Such systems are particularly large—meaning they are composed of many layers of neural networks—and their appetite for data is immense. The reason that ChatGPT sounds so lifelike and seems to know so many things about the world is that the “large language model” inside it has been trained on terabytes of text drawn from the Internet, including millions of websites, Wikipedia articles, and full-length books. This is what Pasquinelli means when he writes that the neural networks of contemporary AI are “not a model of the biological brain but of the collective mind,” a social endeavor to which many people have contributed. Not everyone is pleased by this fact. Generative AI’s voraciousness is responsible for what the podcast host Michael Barbaro calls its “original sin”: copyrighted material is among the information ingested. The New York Times has sued OpenAI for copyright infringement; so has the Authors Guild, alongside Jonathan Franzen, George Saunders, and several other writers. While OpenAI and the other major “model creators” do not disclose the details of their training data, OpenAI has conceded that copyrighted works are included—yet maintains that this falls under fair use. Meanwhile the demand for training data keeps growing, compelling tech companies to find new ways of obtaining it. OpenAI, Meta, and others have struck licensing deals with publishers such as Reuters, Axel Springer, and the Associated Press, and they are exploring similar arrangements with Hollywood studios. For Pasquinelli there is a lesson here. Contemporary AI’s reliance on our aggregated contributions proves that intelligence is a “social process by constitution.” It is communal, emergent, diffuse—and thus a perfect match for the connectionist paradigm. “It comes as no surprise that the most successful AI technique, namely artificial neural networks, is the one that can best mirror, and therefore best capture, social cooperation,” he writes. There is a Marxist coloring to this argument: intelligence resides in the creativity of the masses. But it is also an argument that could have been made by the profoundly anti-Marxist Hayek. The old Austrian would be gratified to know that the “intellect” of the most sophisticated software in history is sourced from the unplanned activities of a multitude. He would have been further tickled by the fact that such software is, like his beloved market, fundamentally unknowable. The strangeness at the heart of the generative AI boom is that nobody really knows how the technology works. We know how the large language models within ChatGPT and its counterparts are trained, even if we don’t always know which data they’re being trained on: they are asked to predict the next string of characters in a sequence. But exactly how they arrive at any given prediction is a mystery. The computations that occur inside the model are simply too intricate for any human to comprehend. You can’t just pop the hood and watch the gears click away. In the absence of direct observation, one is left with a more oblique method: interpretation. An entire technical field has sprung up around AI “interpretability” or “explainability,” with the goal of puzzling out how such systems work. Its practitioners across academia and industry talk in scientistic terms, but their endeavor has a devotional quality, not unlike the exegesis of holy texts or of the entrails of freshly sacrificed sheep. There is a limit to how much meaning can be made. Mortals must content themselves with partial truths. If today’s “AI monopolies” represent “the new ‘eye of the master,’” as Pasquinelli believes, it is an eye with a limited field of vision. The factories of Babbage’s day were zones of visibility: by concentrating work and workers, they put the labor process in full view. Contemporary AI is the opposite. Its casing is stubbornly opaque. Not even the master can see inside.

Title: Country club culture no more: Inside Microsoft's move to cull staff on performance

In 2023, a Microsoft employee asked to take on a lighter workload when his wife was found to have terminal cancer. His managers were supportive, and they appeared happy with his performance during his wife's illness as recently as late 2024, when they told him to expect 120% of his bonus. Then, on January 22, the employee said, an HR representative unexpectedly joined his weekly manager meeting. The employee was fired without severance and was told his health insurance would expire that night. The employee said the gap in coverage meant his wife had to skip chemotherapy treatments for a month after. "I'm still shocked," he told Business Insider in a recent interview. "Shocked and angry. I did everything right." The Microsoft employee asked not to be identified to protect future career prospects. BI has verified his identity and confirmed details of his performance, his termination, and his wife's illness through documentation. A Microsoft spokesperson, Frank Shaw, said performance-based terminations rarely come as a surprise to employees and people could elect to have COBRA coverage. Nearly 2,000 employees were fired by Microsoft in January and February in a culling of those deemed low performers, a person familiar with the cuts said. This kind of performance-based mass cut is a shift for the tech giant. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as part of changes to the company's performance review and management process that are still under review, several people with knowledge of the plans said. "We aspire to have a high-performance culture and want to make sure managers have the ability to drive that and that expectations are clear," Shaw said, adding that the company wasn't trying to design a tougher system, but one that removes ambiguity, provides clarity and flexibility, and allows managers and teams to move with speed. Microsoft's new approach to performance management is shaping up to be one of the biggest changes to the company's management strategy since Satya Nadella became CEO more than a decade ago. Before he assumed the role in 2014, Microsoft had a reputation for a cutthroat performance-review system, at least in a tech industry that often mollycoddled talented employees. Nadella softened that considerably. Microsoft once had a reputation for a "country club" culture, as Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, called it, a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. Now, some leaders worry the company has gotten too soft, making it difficult to shed underperformers, according to the people familiar with Microsoft's plans. The company is looking to new external leaders, such as the former Google executive Mustafa Suleyman and a former Meta engineering chief, Jay Parikh, along with existing executives like the company's senior leadership team and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, to help design a new way to evaluate employees, these people said. Microsoft has had an incredibly successful decade, becoming a leading cloud provider and AI player. It's worth about $3 trillion, making the software giant the third-largest company by that measure. The stock has stagnated over the past year, however, as questions mount about the company's Copilot technology, and as AI competition intensifies. The broader tech industry is facing other challenges, and Microsoft is not immune. A decadelong hiring boom has fizzled as companies focus more on profit, and AI coding tools reduce competition for software engineering talent. Meta recently cut about 5% of its workforce to "raise the bar on performance management," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an internal memo in January. Amazon is culling managers. Even Google is trimming jobs. Employees who were let go in Microsoft's recent round of performance cuts got termination letters explaining the abrupt exit. "The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position," said several letters viewed by BI. "You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft." The letters mentioned severance but said medical, prescription, and dental benefits ended on the last day of employment. The letters also said Microsoft would consider past performance and termination if the person applied for other jobs at the company in the future. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," a company spokesperson told BI recently. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." Deena Merlen, a partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told BI her law firm had received more inquiries about performance-based layoffs as of late. "Employers generally have the right to fire, just as an employee has the right to quit," she said. "As long as Microsoft's alleged performance-based reasons are not for some other, unlawful reason, Microsoft is within its rights to engage in these layoffs." The company has no obligation to provide severance, but such agreements often come with a release of legal claims that can protect the company from lawsuits, Merlen added. Before 2014, Microsoft used a controversial system to evaluate employee performance. Called stack ranking, it forced managers to put employees on a curve and cut the lowest performers. At Microsoft, that meant managers had to rank employees from 1 to 5, and someone always had to get a 5, the lowest score, no matter how well they or the team performed. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said that the system was especially problematic for small teams and that while terminating the lowest rung was not a companywide policy, it happened on some teams. Stack ranking was unpopular internally and was seen as prioritizing individual work, pitting employees against one another and creating a barrier to collaboration. Developers and even entire organizations had a tendency to reject acceptable solutions to problems if they hadn't developed those solutions themselves, the company's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, previously told BI. There's even a famous cartoon depicting Microsoft's org chart as warring factions. The company officially abandoned stack ranking just before Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014. He redesigned the company's performance-review system around the "growth mindset" concept. The idea is that skills are developed through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a "fixed mindset," which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure. Nadella and his new leadership team applied this growth mindset to a new framework called "model, coach, care," which called on managers to set a positive example for employees, help staffers adapt and learn, and invest in people's professional growth. Instead of ranking employees from 1 to 5, Microsoft moved to a performance-review system that gives managers a simple payroll budget they could divide and dole out to employees based on performance. Kevin Oakes, the CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, has worked with Microsoft on implementing a growth mindset. He told BI this approach was a way to encourage top performers but noted that even companies like Microsoft need to cull their workforces to become leaner and higher performing. "Any high-performing organization should make sure employees are performing at an acceptable level, and they should be weeding out people who are not performing at an acceptable level," he said. "Over time, you tend to get a little bloated as a big company where you've let hiring go unchecked in some areas and need to get back to a lean, efficient machine." Today, employees are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 200 called the "ManageRewards slider." The process begins with frontline managers, who evaluate an employee's impact and recommend where they think they should land on the slider. Then, a higher-level manager considers "differentiation" — i.e., making sure the team is distributed along the slider. The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses. A score of "Impact 60," for example, generally gives employees 0% of their stock award and 30% of their maximum cash bonuses while the slightly higher rating of "Impact 80" gives them 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said 100 would be considered a good score and mean an employee had met all of their objectives. In general, the company's senior leadership team gives managers a budget that allows for every employee on the team an average score of 109. "So you want to pay someone Impact 140 for doing an outstanding job? Find three people you're giving Impact 100 so it's affordable," one executive-level manager explained. "Keep this guy around. He'll be paying for everyone's bonuses." The manager said they typically had paid top performers by finding a set of people who failed in the previous year and giving them all zero or reduced rewards. This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. "That's a bad manager," Shaw said. "You certainly can't give everybody high rewards," but it's still possible to give one person high rewards while keeping other people's scores close to 100, he added. While low rewards can indicate a performance issue, Microsoft's actual system for managing out low performers is separate from this employee-rating process. Generally, managers email an internal HR system and request a consultation for performance concerns, and the manager will be matched with an internal consultant. More seasoned consultants are used for higher-level employees, or if the situation is difficult. These consultants often give written formal feedback to employees, saying they delivered "Less Impact than Expected" and would be starting a three-month performance-management process. Some managers can cut low performers who don't improve within about four months through this process. But sometimes Microsoft's HR department concludes that managers haven't done enough performance coaching, one manager said, meaning they have not generated enough documentation showing employees have been given the opportunity to improve and have repeatedly failed. It can take two or three more 90-day programs before these employees are ousted. One high-level manager said the average time to exit a low performer was seven months from the time a manager notified HR about the situation, which often comes after sustained low performance. "It takes too long to performance-manage folks out," one executive said. These exits can be further delayed by leaves of absence. One of the Microsoft managers who talked to BI said employees sometimes shared tips on how to complicate the company's performance-improvement process. One common suggestion: If your manager is working to fire you, go to a doctor and say you have certain symptoms, get a supporting letter, and secure health-related time off work. This can pause or reset aspects of the process, this person said. Short-term paid disability typically covers 60 to 90 days away from work, and Microsoft's HR department can be reluctant to exit these employees for some time after that, the person said. "For employees gaming the short-term disability policies, you can be talking 12 to 18 months to get to a point where HR is comfortable firing them," they added. In the US, a common refrain for the 0-to-200 performance reviews was, "One Year, One Reward," meaning employees are judged on a single year's performance. The separation between rewards and the formal performance-management process gave flexibility to managers to "harvest the budget," as one manager said, in other words give lower ratings to relatively adequate performers so big rewards could be doled out to high performers. They could do this without much risk to the employment status of the adequate performers. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said this was not company policy. Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, in an internal email in 2023 instructed managers to give fewer employees "exceptional rewards," meaning a high performance rating that leads to higher pay and bonuses. "More will need to be at the middle of the range," Hogan said in the email. Shaw, the spokesperson, said the email was specific to that year and that rewards changed annually based on factors like the economy and company performance. Changes to this year's rewards cycle won't be solidified until later in the year, he said. "Microsoft just summarily terminated hundreds of employees who had year-over-year insufficient performance based on rewards, without a lengthy documentation and feedback process," one executive said, adding that this coming rewards season would be more difficult on managers, who would have to be more careful about doling out low rewards. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, confirmed that the decisions about whom to cut came from looking at rewards year over year but said the company still believed in "one year, one reward." Just because an employee gets high rewards one year, for example, doesn't mean they've earned it the next. As Microsoft evaluates its performance-review process, people familiar with the plans say the company is looking for perspectives from new leaders such as Suleyman, the former Google executive who is now Microsoft's CEO of AI, and Parikh, the former head of engineering at Meta who runs AI platforms at Microsoft. Shaw said that Suleyman and Parikh were just some of the people providing perspective and that Roslansky, the LinkedIn CEO, had also provided a lot of input. "The company will have a much stronger point of view, like some of our competitors," one Microsoft executive said. The company is making other changes to prioritize engineering talent and level out organizations, taking a page from Amazon. Separate from its performance-management processes, Microsoft is starting to weigh how it can become leaner and more engineering-focused. The company measures what it calls "good attrition," which is reviewed at the executive level, the Microsoft executive said. That's reminiscent of Amazon's "unregretted attrition." Right now there are no targets for this Microsoft metric. But the company is borrowing from Amazon in trying to increase the ratio of engineers working on projects. Amazon has something called the "Builder Ratio," which analyzes the ratio of software engineers to "non-builders," such as program managers and project managers. The goal is to try to keep organizations lean. Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss who came from Amazon's cloud unit, has brought this metric to Microsoft. Microsoft tracks the "PM ratio" which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers, and has increased targets in the current fiscal year. For example, Bell's security organization right now is around 5.5 engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach 10:1, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans. Have a tip?

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India JioStar is laying off more than 1,100 employees to eliminate overlapping job positions following the merger between Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Viacom18 and The Walt Disney Company’s India division, according to a report by LiveMint. The layoff drive includes job losses for entry-level employees, senior managers, directors, and even those at the assistant vice president level. “The departures started a month ago, and they are not ending anytime soon,” said one of the people quoted in LiveMint’s report. The downsizing will continue until June and will primarily focus on corporate-level positions in JioStar’s distribution, finance, commercial, and legal departments, according to people interviewed by LiveMint. This move comes at a time when JioStar is targeting to increase the efficiency of its operations and focus on high-growth verticals—specifically digital streaming and sports. “Whenever two large companies with similar businesses merge, redundancies are inevitable,” an industry executive told LiveMint. “This restructuring is about optimizing resources and reducing duplication, ensuring the joint venture operates as a leaner and more efficient entity,” they added. A rival media company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) confirmed that they have been receiving resumes from JioStar employees—many of whom have annual salaries exceeding Rs 1 crore—ready to make the switch. However, the laid-off employees will receive a severance package from JioStar, which is a silver lining: affected workers will receive six to twelve months’ salary as part of the payout plan. The company will provide employees with one full month’s salary for every year they have worked, in addition to a notice period of one to three months. For example, an employee who has worked for less than six years will receive a minimum of seven months’ pay and benefits, including the notice period. Meanwhile, those with longer tenures at the company will receive up to 15 months of compensation. Even employees who have not completed the compulsory five-year period for gratuity eligibility will receive a pro-rata payout. On the other hand, some affected employees, specifically from tech and digital services, will reportedly get jobs within Jio or the wider Reliance ecosystem. The only unaffected department when it comes to the current job cuts at JioStar is the sports department, as the media giant plans to expand its sports portfolio and launch new sports channels. For context, JioStar currently offers broadcast and online streaming of the ICC Champions Trophy, the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the FIH Hockey Pro League, the Premier League, and the Indian Super League, on its Star Sports TV channels and JioHotstar streaming platform. This offering will further expand in about two weeks’ time as the Indian Premier League (IPL) – which is scheduled to take place over two months – kicks off on March 22. As a result, there won’t be any panic about job losses or layoffs in its sports department for now. JioStar’s sports portfolio expansion aligns with the company’s 2023 strategy, when its JioCinema platform secured exclusive streaming rights for the IPL from the now-defunct Disney+ Hotstar. In a similar vein the streaming platform carried out another invaluable coup when it agreed a deal with Warner Bros. to stream its entire content library after Disney+ Hotstar chose not to renew its contract. At the end of the day, JioStar’s overarching aim with all these acquisitions is to rival and eventually marginalise streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in the Indian online streaming market.
